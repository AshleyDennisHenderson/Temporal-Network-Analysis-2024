left Liverpool Camp at 8.30 a.m. & entrained for Woolloomooloo Bay where we boarded troopship \"Berrima\" for port \"unknown\" (rumours said Egypt). Wife, Father, Mother & Sister met procession from Central Railway Stn. at Goulburn & Elizabeth Streets & accompanied me to steamer, \nexcept Dad who having Mab in his arms had to break off at Oxford St.\n Had a great send off. A crowd of small motor boats loaded with friends of troops, accompanying Berrima to Heads. A rough night out, many sick myself O.K.\n\n Liverpool 9-5 a.m. – left Heads about \n","2":"\n\nService in morning. Nothing else of particular moment.\n","3":"\n\nArrived Port Phillip about midday. Anchored off Williamstown, near Idly br. and took off a couple of hundred Victorian soldiers from steamer, then left for sea again, passing Queenscliff about 9 p.m.\n","4":"\n\nNothing of moment. Slept on deck to avoid close atmosphere of mess deck.\n","5":"\n\n4½ days out: life aboard ship already becoming monotonous. Slept below: very uncomfortable.\n","6":"\n\nRough sea all day with strong head wind – the latter has been encountered all the way – things not all violets aboard – very damp. Slept below in consequence. Pleasant dreams of home as usual.\n","7":"\n\nReveille sounded to the tune of a howling gale with heavy rain &\n\na high sea. Shipping heaps of water down mess deck. Great amusement amongst men who by now are beginning to get their sea legs.\n\nAt about 8.30 a.m. \nwith\n a great rain-storm appeared on the western horizon & travelling with great rapidity soon enveloped the approaching ship in a dense cloud of rain, hail & brine from the angry tumultuous sea. The wind blew with hurricane force but the good ship \"Berrima\" stuck to her task. The disturbance passed as quickly away as it had meteorically appeared & within the space of 15 minutes from striking the ship had passed away to eastward leaving us \non the\n panting on the bosom of the cruelly beaten sea.\n","8":"\n\nWatch on bridge 8 am to 12 noon – 8 pm to midnight – a stormy day with fierce head winds & rain squalls. Passed Albany to the northward, a good many miles south at about mid-day. \"Berrima\" proved herself a good sea boat but a perfect devil \nas far\n for shipping seas f’ward. Our mess deck frequently drenched down companion way & saloon deck wet all over. Heard frequent complaints about uncomfortable conditions aboard, men smoking in latrines & lavatories to avoid dampness overhead.\n","9":"\n\nA brighter day – sunshine with pleasant southward breeze – mess orderly. Watch duties cancelled by Captain of ship.\n","10":"\n\nMonotonous day – buck concert at night – the monotony of the voyage is depressive & becoming more accentuated every day. Due west of Sydney at noon.\n","11":"\n\nA pleasant day on the calm bosom of the Indian Ocean. A gentle S.W. zephyr did little to disturb the tranquility of the day. The blue dome above was unflecked by clouds & reflected itself in the unruffled water unsparingly. \nBeyond\n A lazy swell, wh to the troops had the effect of a sweet lullaby on a new born child, predominated throughout the day. One accident marred the day. We lost our mascot – Miss Wallaby – overboard. Whether this be an ominous sign, we do not know – at any rate, her loss was soon forgotten wh spells much for the optimism of the troops.\n\nThe journey is becoming tiresome in its dull monotonous routine – deck concerts help one at night to dispel gloomy thoughts.\n","12":"\n\nWashing day – a unique & novel experience. Sunshine & rain during the day. Slept on deck atmosphere too close below – pleasant dreams of home.\n","13":"\n\nWarmer weather – becoming more pronounced every day.\n\nKeeping in great trim – boxing & physical exercises practiced daily. Feel a little tight across chest but nothing serious.\n","14":"\n\nA hot oppressive day – \"full marching orders\" parade. The atmosphere is thick & muggy, & the troops perspire freely & curse the stifling heat. As we approach the equator each day, warmer conditions prevail. Discarded cardigan jacket for the first time – others throwing off thick underwear. Rush for saloon & boat decks at night. The dull routine of ship life is unbearable – my restless nature craves for greater activity & change of purview. Nothing to see from day to day beyond the limitless expanse of the ocean – not a ship sighted for over a week.\n","15":"\n\nAnother hot day, calm sea – awnings necessary on well & boat decks. Boxing contest B Co. afternoon. Col. Lamrock & other officers present. Some good stoush, with a minimum of skill. One clean knock-out. Despite the uneventful voyage with its monotonous daily life, the troops display a remarkable buoyancy of spirits. Whether they realize the seriousness of the work before them in a few weeks, they do not show it by their attitude on board. One would think they were on a huge picnic or harbour excursion – their happy disposition speaks volumes for their heroic self-sacrifice for the great cause.\n","16":"\n\nRose at 4.30 a.m. The stars shone white & as dawn broke across placid surface of the ocean, I felt a new self arise in me – the morning was so peaceful & majestic, the sun as it rose \nthrough\n threw a golden glory over the distant horizon, & finally appeared in a great white disc in all its glittering heat. A ragged edge of clouds, low down, turned like red hot coals, & the sea between the ship & the distant flaming orb became a molten mass, magnificent in its grandeur & at which the eye could gaze but for a \nglimpse\n second, so powerful was the sheen. A new self – yes, like dead scales the superficialities, the falsities, the habits of life of the world I have left behind seemed for the instant, whilst I gazed upon that awe-inspiring scene, to drop from me. Romance & a keen observation of beauteous nature engendered & fostered in me from that moment a feeling of love for all things beautiful & serene, and I offered a silent prayer to heaven that I was alive to appreciate \nthe significance of\n the mighty splendour of that glorious sunrise.\n\nPosition of ship about 15 degrees south of equator – 15 by 80 north.\n","17":"\n\nBurning hot day – calm sea – little breeze. Stifling conditions aboard – nothing of moment, mess orderly.\n","18":"\n\nFirst sign of flying fish – huge schools all day. Finals of \"B\" Co.’s boxing contests.\n","19":"\n\nAnniversary of establishment of French Republic & Fall of the Bastile. Half holiday on board. Officers’ dining saloon gaily bedecked with flags at night, & champagne, beer & cigars enjoyed with riot enthusiasm. Troops also celebrated the event with – sour bread, marmalade, & shadow tea. \nCrossed the Equator about 7 or 8 p.m.\n Nearing the equator, officers enjoyed a Father Neptune pageant\n\nwhich the troops could hear but not see. \"What the eye don’t see the heart don’t grieve.\"\n\nRabbit diet for dinner getting mighty monotonous – insipid, tough, & boney.\n\nDay was intolerably hot & muggy.\n","20":"\n\nEquatorial weather with a vengeance. Blistering heat. Scarce a ripple on the sea. Sour bread & corned horse for dinner. Complained about bread but was given the option of hard biscuits for 3 days or continuance of bread. \"This is the life.\" Crossed the Equator at noon. Half holiday. Neptune’s sports & boxing championships.\n","21":"\n\nUneventful.\n","22":"\n\nFresh westerly – heavy swell. Boxing semi finals on saloon deck – rough conditions at night – saloon deck port side frequently awash – slept below – bad night – ship rolling heavily – about 4 a.m. all awakened by terrific thump on ship’s side & scattering of crockery, plates, boxes & other gear. Many thought it was a collision so great was the noise. When we rose at Reveille the mess deck was strewn with a mass of gear – from plates, knives, forks, cups, cheese, butter, clothes etc. In fact everything had been shifted by the impact of the night – wind blowing strong from W – proximity of coast no doubt the cause – expect to pass Aden during day or night.\n","23":"\n\nHellish weather – monsoon – decks awash all day.\n\nBoat changed her course about 2 pm to due west from NW, as we approach Gulf of Aden. Then we received the full blast of the terrific wind & storm wrack – great green seas came at us as if determined to envelop us in one huge swallow & thumped down on the deck every minute or two like mighty knocks from a gigantic hammer. The ship alternately rolled & pitched & the storm continued late into the night. Lily two years old today.\n","24":"\n\nDaybreak saw the storm spent of its previous day’s fury & we were able to walk about the deck with some degree of ease & pleasure. Mess orderly.\n\nA pleasant afternoon with Southern Arabia on our right. Calm seas with cool breeze tempering suns rays. Due north Cape Gardifue noon, NW comes island \"Socotra\".\n","25":"\n\nApproaching Aden. Steamers becoming frequently – passed Harrison Liner – Aden to India – at about noon. Others sighted.\n\nHot close evening – ships in the night spoke 3 cruisers – Japs it was said, flashlights signalling & shore fires. Passed through Hell’s Gate at about 3 am\n\nReceived first wireless concerning war to the effect that Gen. French had reported that Germans were active on the French Frontier & had gained trenches but had been repulsed. Message posted on saloon deck at about 8 p.m. Dated \"London official 20th July 1915\".\n","26":"\n\nIn the Red Sea – calm sea – muggy & sticky atmosphere – at 7 o’clock 3 ships in sight to the north – a large passenger, small packed & cargo in light trim – we soon passed them & they quickly faded away in the haze.\n\nNo Parades a\/c excessive heat.\n\nPassed the 4 Brothers & 12 Apostles during day, the former on African side, the latter Arabian side. How awesome & grand are these lone sentinels of the Red Sea. Barren huge rocks rising in pyramidical shape for the most part & towering into the sky. As we passed each group of the Apostles with their white lighthouse perched on their highest point, I could not reconcile\n\nmyself to imagine how one could live in such strange solitude. Yet the lighthouse keeper lives there & what a hermit’s life it must be. No companionship nor life, nor sign of it except the passing of a steamer in the distance.\n","27":"\n\nNothing of moment – issued with identification disc & Pay Book. Continuance of \"No Parades\".\n","28":"\n\nA beautiful day – cool breeze. Expect all these to be posted on arrival at Suez. None of previous letters dropped at Aden. Will all go in one bunch at Suez.\n","29":"\n\nCooler weather. Pleasant head wind. Evening saw us in sight of African coast & Sinai on the east. How peculiarly awe-inspiring are these glimpses of historic landmarks. The aspect of the country is volcanic & its rugged bareness & dull brown color vividly contrasts with the bright blue sea & dashing foam. Sinai, for instance, commencing low down rises in irregular slopes till its summit reaches to the very heavens & then gradually fades away to the sea again in the same fashion as it rises. What food for thought & quiet muse for the dreamer. As I gazed I recalled the incidents of this land of the Bible & I could not realise that before me was that Sinai where the Ten Commandments were given to this world by the Maker of All.\n","30":"\n\nArrived at Port Suez 9 o’clock. What a picturesque change & what magnetic charm has this first glimpse of this new life to me. The rippling impact of the port gleams with opalescent beauty & the yellow sand dunes contrast vividly with the changing hues of the heated atmosphere. A weird & bizarre mountain lies\n\non our left & ahead, a quarter mile off lies the town of Suez, its buildings resting low upon the water. The port is full of shipping & everything around us is life.\n\nThis contact with civilization has put good humour into the Troops. In full service dress they crowd the rails & bargain for fruit, sweetmeats & P’Cs with the miscellaneous crowd of Arabs & other dusky skinned desert sons who have tied their boats to the ship’s sides. I have fed on Barbary grapes & Turkish Delight & bought Post Cards of Port Said to send home.\n\nHow happy & contented I feel. My whole soul harmonises with the perfect serenity of the scene around me.\n\nWhat a picture for an artist to conceive, or put to canvas. Not a wisp of cloud mars the blue dome overhead, a soft zephyr plays & gambols around us just sufficient to temper the hot sun’s rays & cause a dancing ripple upon the Sea. & Near us the water sparkles in light blue and as the eye travels towards the shore becomes darker & finally ends near the golden sands in an infinite royal blue. My opinion of \"far fetched\" paintings has changed. I have looked upon a picture more dazzling in its varied hues than any master painter could conceive.\n\nAs noon approached the cool wind of the morning was consumed by a boiling sun & from then till sunset the heat was unbearable. Evening however brought the pleasant conditions of the early morn.\n\nAn Indian troopship \"Zeesta\" arrived during afternoon with Gurkhas & Sikhs on board for Marseilles. Our officers entertained their officers at dinner on \"Berrima\".\n","31":"\n\nDisembarked inside breakwater at about 9.30 a.m. Indescribable state of things aboard. Gear & kit bags everywhere. The quiet life of the past four weeks has now been replaced by hustle & bustle on every hand. The troops welcome the change & realise that an active life is far preferable to lazy idle routine aboard. They see what\n\nduty they have ahead of them & are fully aware of its seriousness.\n\nMajor Murphy speaking to A Co. last night appreciably affected the men with the earnestness of his remarks. He spoke to them as a father to his children & warned them that perhaps a fortnight would seem them all in the firing line.\n\nThis morning before embarkation I learnt with sorrow that an officer, Mr. Richards, had gone down with appendicitis & would be left behind to undergo an operation.\n\nWe left Suez at 11 o’clock in a rickety third class train – the carriages not being much superior to the boxes I used to house pigeons in.\n\nThe journey was full of incident – the Govt. buildings at Suez were unique & austere, clean & with the stamp of civilization upon them. They were in striking contrast to the Square and houses of the Natives.\n\nWith a squeaking & grinding of wheels we moved out into the desert & soon the second & last port of call, the good ship \"Berrima\" & all kind friends aboard her faded away to our rear.\n\nThe land through wh we travelled appeared to be thoroughly irrigated & exceptionally fertile. Passing through huge palm groves, field of maize & other cereals I was sensibly appreciative of the industry here shown by the inhabitants in their attempt to turn the arid desert to some use.\n\nAt Mariche, a small unpretentious station, we bought watermelons, pomegranates, dates, nuts, figs & grapes,\n\n& had a \"grand banquet\". The journey was full of such incidents – at Zazazig we were allowed to get off the train to stretch our legs & buy what refreshments we desired.\n\nWe arrived at Heliopolis at about 6, after a short march from the Station.\n\nMuch impressed by the residential appearances of these suburbs of Cairo. Wide tar-paved streets with mostly big cement colored houses bearing the resemblance of flats. The majority contain gardens & everything has an air of grandeur about it.\n\nWe camped on the desert – great many were already under canvas – British, Victorians, New Zealanders & N.S.W. In fact all Australia is represented.\n\nGreat bustle in camp. Cheered all along the way of march. Glad to get rid of packs.\n\nSlept on the desert outside mess-room which is built of light wood.\n","32":"\n\nReveille at 5. Breakfasted at Heliopolis at a French Restaurant. Heliopolis is within Camp bounds. Pass needed for Cairo.\n\nHeliopolis I find is regarded by the natives as a Holy Town. Here it was, I am told, that Joseph converted Mary & wooed her. What a mixture of humanity is here. Arabians, Soudanese, French, Italian, Swiss – in fact all the polyglot crowd of the Northern Africa. What a shrill cacophony greets our ears – the bargaining natives swarm round us with their goods & exhort us to buy at extravagant figures. As we sit at breakfast small Arab boys, dirty & ill clothed, cry for backsheesh & grovel & scramble in the dust for cigarette ends.\n\nBreakfast cost us about two piastres, equivalent to 5d. in English money.\n\nOur O.C., Mr. Richards, arrives from Suez.\n","33":"\n\nDaily Routine – Reveille 5. Early parade 6 to 9 a.m. Breakfast 9-15 – as soon after early parade as is possible. Lecture 11 to 12. Parade 5 to 7 p.m. The morning parade is a killer – 3 hours on an empty stomach – we shall without doubt get \"fit\" under these conditions or \"go out to it\" altogether. As it is impossible to drill for any length of time in the midday heat\n\nit reason for this early parade is obvious. Visited Heliopolis at night.\n","34":"\n\nBeginning to get things in shape. Moved into large tent – square-shaped & airy. We sleep, but do not mess in this.\n\nAnniversary of wedding. Pleasant thoughts.\n","35":"\n\nMail closed. Sent 4 P.C’s to Mabel, 1 each to Dad, Mum & Gran. Had a chat with Arthur Gray. How I am longing to hear from home. My only worry is for those far away. How dear are they to me.\n","36":"\n\nVisited Cairo during afternoon. This Hell on Earth alluring & repulsive in its vice, crime, & tartuffism \n cannot be described here. I do not need any notes to remind me of its features. Suffice it to say that prostitution, beastiality, drunkenness, crime \n are its chief characteristics. All the sinister temptations of the devil lurk here to catch the unwary. Sordid & debauched. Cairo is a pestilential cesspit, a creator of ‘evil & a destroyer of souls’. \"Wazzar\" burnt down by troops.\n","37":"\n\nVisited Cairo. How wonderful is the fascination of the place. Though nauseating beyond description something draws you on & so the Master Fiend finds heaps of victims. His greedy talons are about everywhere. Why does not the Almighty wreak some mighty vengeance on this rotten hole as he did with Sodom & Gomohrn.\n","38":"\n\nMess orderly. Usual routine.\n","39":"\n","40":"\n","41":"\n","42":"\n\nUsual routine.\n","43":"\n","44":"\n\nAppreciably surprised at slovenly style of Church Parade. No discipline, smoking, talking & general irregularity. Platoon Sergeants worse than the men. The whole show simply a parody.\n","45":"\n\nNothing of moment\n","46":"\n\nUsual routine.\n","47":"\n\nUsual routine. Informed of the fall of Achi-Baba (rumour). Wrote Mab another letter (unfinished).\n","48":"\n\nWarned that we shall leave for the front in 10 days. \n\nAll the afternoon great excitement & endless rumours re Dardanelles. Musketry course being pushed on with greatest possible speed & it is on everbodys lips that we may move off at any moment. There is\n\nan air of expectency everywhere & we are prepared for anything in the way of orders.\n\nRumour has it that the","49":" of the 20th & 21st Reinforcements have been cut up at the Dardanelles & that Lieut. Harper, who accompanied us on the \"Berrima\" has been killed. (All wrong.)\n\nI write by dull candle light on the dark shades of our tent; around me my comrades earnestly discuss the chances of the future & their serious faces & talk alternately merry, happy-go-lucky, & lurid in its expressiveness, betrays their determination to carry things out with a big heart & to the end. \"Do or die\" is our motto.\n\nFriday 13th Aug. 1915\n\nRumours & rumours of war. The whole camp is seething with\n\nexcited expectancy. \"Off on Sunday\" is the general thing. We were all startled tonight by the news that the Turks had surrendered unconditionally on a\/c of Bulgaria having declared war against her. But I doubt. We are still packing up & we are off there’s no doubt. Long expected mail in.\n","50":"\n\nPay day. £1 received.\n\nFirst musketry course. Not bad.\n","51":"\n\nAttended Holy Communion.\n\nSent further letter to Mab: also New Testament (registered). Sent further P C’s to all. \n\nStruck camp at 4 p.m. & warned to be in readiness to march off at 11 p.m. Carter, Keating & myself paid a final visit to Cairo.\n","52":"\n\nEntrained at Zeitoun at 1-30 am for Alexandria. Arrived latter place about 6 am. Embarked at once on S\/S \"Saturnia\". Met Arthur Gray on board. Had a long chat with him about home etc. Left Alexandria about 7 pm.\n\nThe \"Saturnia\" is the dirtiest most stinking ship I have met in my experience. Packed like sardines aboard (3500 troops about) the atmosphere in the mess decks below where we are supposed to sleep, is foetid & suffocating. The lavatories & latrines are unapproachable, human excrement & an indescribable mass of filth in the shape of decomposed meat, bread, straw & other refuse floats around in rank pools of urine & putrid water. Little fresh water is available & the food is disheartening both in quality & quantity. I have heard frequent complaints of bugs & lice & body vermin & I am not surprised. The ship is a disease breeder & thank God our journey upon it will be short.\n\nI sleep on deck where one has an opportunity of breathing the pure ozone.\n","53":"\n\nLife belt parade at 3 pm. Quite a parody of a show in itself. I can imagine the state of affairs on the sound of an alarm. Hell would then be let loose & mad riot reign supreme. There are two battalions & several \"details\" aboard. Life belts are short & the boats are not \"efficient\" by any means. Inoculated for Cholera 4 pm..\n","54":"\n\nThis morning I am struck by the extreme calm & beauty of the blue Meditteranean & how peaceful a scene it must be to the roaring torment of war which is being raged not many miles ahead. Today we are at rest on the calm bosom of a summers sea – tomorrow, aye, tomorrow, perhaps the dread torpedo will send us to the bottom unwarned & to die like rats in a trap. For we are in the extreme danger zone now of the enemy’s submarines. Only 25 miles ahead one day August 13 last week a troop ship Royal Edward (?) containing drafts & reinforcements for the Med. Imp. force was \nsunk\n sent to a watery grave & only 25% of the brave fellows aboard were saved. And so we sail along taking the same risk. A great risk but how great is the spirit of our troops. Happy & debonair they sing like so many larks on a bright April morn & their hearts are big & strong. They have resigned themselves to the inevitable.\n\nWe passed the Grecian Archipellago during the day – Tinos, Denos & Sirra (?). These towns nestle in the side of steep dun brown hills or along the sea shore & are quite bizarre & picturesque.\n\nA beautiful sunset – here we saw \"the roseate hues of the sun-burnt west\" in all its magnificent glory.\n\nAttended Holy Communion – Arthur Gray present.\n","55":"\n\nArrived at Lemnos at daylight. A hive of shipping – warships, troopships, & merchantmen. Hospital Ships also frequent – I notice one of the latter named the \"Dunluce Castle\". Served with 200 rounds of ammunition each. \nSent a P.C. to Mabel\n \"Expect to be in action tomorrow\".\n\nNotice HMAS \"Sydney\" in harbour. Served with two days rations.\n\nFriday 20th Aug. 1915\n\n19th & Reinforcements of 18th, and 19th Bns., together with 5th Field Ambulance, left on S\/S \"Osmanieh\"\n\nfor Gallipoli at 7 p.m. ","56":" Bn left behind on \"Saturnia\".\n","57":"\n\nGeneral clean up – ship now in a far cleaner condition than when we boarded her. The latrines are now fit for use & the ship is habitable.\n\nThis morning I have counted over 100 ships at anchor in the Bay – Mudros Bay as it is called. It is a circular bay of good proportions. The shore line is mostly tenanted by the military & seems as far as I can see from the ship to be under cultivation – fodder etc. About ½ mile (?) inwards the land rises by a series of gradual declivities & so the whole has the appearance of a huge basin. The mouth of the bay is narrow & is protected by booms & nets. The channel for entrance is narrow. Hostile ships, underwater craft etc are absolutely debarred from entering. The bay forms an excellent base.\n\nLeft Mudros Bay 5 pm for Gallipoli on S\/S \"Osmanieh\". Great send off through lines of British, French & Russian battleships & cruisers. Noticed H.M.S. \"Agamemnon\".\n\nVisibly impressed by speed of \"Osmanieh\" – travelling 18 knots easily. Did 26½ knots on trial speed. Belonged to Khedivial Mail Co., passenger route Alexandria to Constantinople. All lifeboats slung out & life belts ready. Boys in good heart, singing & laughing in chorus. The beginning of what we have longed for during months past is now at hand. What will the end be. Victory! Yes. Victory or nothing.\n\nArrived at \nGaba Tepe\n Anzac (Gaba Tepe a few miles further south) at about 12 pm\n\n(midnight). Long before our arrival we could distinctly see the flash then the roar of the big guns fired from the warships off shore. It was a clear moonlight night, we were \"all lights out\", & we sped along the surface of the moonlit sea like a black phantom of the night. Quite distinct to our silent secrecy were the hospital ships flamboyant with their rows of green lights & huge red crosses \nbrilliantly alight\n & their reflected beauty in the unruffled sea enhanced the charm & serenity of the night. Serene from the artist’s standpoint but from the material disturbed by the evidences of the proximity of grim war. We were bundled ashore in lighters attached to steam pinnaces & soon we landed at the primitive pier which gave us access to the spot where our brave heroes first landed & distinguished themselves as amongst the greatest soldiers in the world. \nA long tramp in the\n","58":"\n\nSevered top of left forefinger with jack-knife.\n\nAfter our landing we had a long tramp\n\nthrough sand ankle deep & of a stoney consistency (carrying rifle, equipment, pack, 200 rounds ammunition, flags). Passing through trenches 6 ft high for fully a mile we ascended a broken rocky barren defile becoming steeper & twisting snake like as we progressed & at last came to a halt in a Gully (known as \"Red Gully\" by the troops) where we lay down & rested our wearied limbs till daylight.\n\nOn awakening my eyes were crusted with dust & my parched throat cried aloud for relief. The country around us bore a remarkable appearance. Camped in a tortuous defile of narrow proportions with high broken hills of crumbling sun baked sand & soil \npractically\n devoid of vegetation, except for a few isolated patches of stunted prickly gorse. The whole scene at once conveyed to me the enormous difficulties & risks of the great tasks of our brave comrades who participated in that glorious charge\n\nwh has now become an historical event in the annals of military warfare & will be recorded as one of the most magnificent achievements in this great war of nations.\n\nAt\n All the night through I slept with \"one eye open\". My active brain ran riot & I was aflame with excited interest in my surroundings. The boom of big guns, the sharp rattle of machine guns & maxims, the ping & singing of bullets overhead & the screech of shells soon became familiar sounds & I was thunderstruck \nwith\n at the equanimity with wh the troops accepted their new life.\n\nAn Indian camp is beside us – Punjabis Mule Corps – they are incessantly at work & their mules are continually passing us, laden with ammunition for the hill batteries. Our Indian friends have christened the Australians \"The White Gurkhas\" because of their great dash & daring. Apropos this, I was speaking to an English Tommy \nyesterday\n today & he was jubilantly enthusiastic\n\nregarding the Australians & New Zealanders. \"Reckless beyond anything I have ever seen, their wonderful dash, daring, & eagerness for fight, has become an established fact,\" he concluded.\n\nOur greatest pest here, outside Snipers’ bullets, is flies. They swarm around us in myriads & are aggravatingly persistent. The more you irritate them the more they attack & stick. They leave us as night falls but are with us again at daybreak.\n\nWe have not to remain here any great time. We leave tonight to support our brave comrades in action & we are glad of it.\n\nMonday 23rd Aug. 1915\n\nWe moved out of camp last night at 7 pm At the foot of the pass where we had rested we entered a long line of trenches to the right, passed through the\n\nIndian camp & soon were in open country, enmeshed under foot with telephone lines (in communication from various batteries & outposts with Div. HQs) wh made our marching more difficult. Our magazines were charged with 10 rounds & we carried an additional 200. It was not long before the snipers found us out & we were peppered with lead \nfrom the\n at short intervals. The range however must have been difficult & no casualties resulted. Moreover we were protected by the shore batteries, mainly howitzers (N.Z. & English) with a range to 2000 yds. Turning to the right from the shore along wh we had been proceeding at a distance of about 200 yds. we soon came to Div. Hqs. Here we rested but as it afforded no great protection for such a large number of troops \nwere\n we soon quickly moved on, taking an abrupt turn to the left & ascended a rocky pass \nbetween\n in single file, the track being only fit for mules. Simply a goat track.\n\nWe had all expected to be in action before midnight but at 10 o’clock, when we had gained the saucer shaped crest of the pass, unexpected orders to bivouac were received. To the accompaniment of a Wagnerian Sonata \nof\n from hill batteries, natives & snipers we laid our wearied limbs on the hillside or on the sandy track & soon the most of us were in grateful sleep, profound & at times very musical. Wildron’s Hill is where we are now camped.\n\nTuesday 24th Aug. 1915\n\nMy notes now must be brief. I have not the time to write in detail. We have been troubled with snipers a great deal & they have also used machine guns on us. Several of our crowd have been hit, especially when they go for water & one man in B Co. was fatally wounded. Borchell, our\n\nofficer’s orderly was hit & sent off to Heliopolis. He was a hale fellow well met & we are sorry to lose him.\n\nThe gallant 18th were in action Sunday night & Monday & suffered severely in an attack on a strongly defended hill. After taking five lines of trenches they were forced to retire & hold two, owing to their being outnumbered. They would have secured a decisive victory if sufficient reinforcements had arrived in time. As it was, report has it that only 300 men out of the whole battalion came through safely. They must have been cut up for the number of wounded being carried to the base hospital as we \npass\n marched here on Sunday night were many & the stretcher bearers then reported that they had had a pretty heavy day.\n\nPortion of the main Turkish railway\n\nline has been cut & our troops hold it. The shore & adjacent hill batteries have done particularly heavy damage during the last few days & the main objective, viz. to cut of supplies, is nearing completion. Captured Turkish Officers state that the Turks are willing to come to terms immediately but for the domineering German Officers who urge them on & tune them up with persuasive lies of Germany’s victories on land & sea. The Turks undoubtedly are losing heavily. From the crest of the hill above us we can see the Turkish trenches full of dead & our outposts report that on approaching them the stench is stifling. Many of the bodies are maggoty & decomposed. The Light Horse to the south of Anzac have been depleted considerably & report has it we have to relieve them in a few days. The trenches there are but 10 to 20 yds apart & hand grenades & bombs form a feature of the\n\nfighting. The Turks are magnificent sharpshooters but are mightily afraid of the bayonet. They fear the charge & depend upon hidden machine guns to do the work, & \nthey ha\n the latter have certainly been the Australians greatest danger. I have seen the Turkish rifle & bayonet the former is lighter than our own .303 & the magazine is fixed, holds only 5 cartridges, there is no cut-off & no safety catch. The bayonet in comparison with our own is much shorter, like a dagger, but the bayonet standard is fashioned after our own.\n\nWednesday 25th Aug.\n\nA day of startling incidents. Daylight was ushered in by a violent cannonade from Shore howitzers & hill batteries (4.7) of the Turkish position due east. The Turkish reply was at first very slow but as the morning progressed they began to get the range with shrapnel & landed alternately on the beach & hill very frequently. The damage however was insignificant. The screech\n\nof the shells overhead & the bursting of the enemy’s shrapnel & the frequent zips from the snipers kept us in our dug-out for the best part of the day. This kind of warfare is very discouraging to the non combatants as we were for we had no opportunity of giving a helping hand. The silent rifles of the Turkish snipers & their hidden positions protected them beyond approach.\n\nAt noon warned to be in readiness to move off at moments’ notice.\n\nWe are now receiving excellent rations, bacon, bread, onions, tea, jam, milk & rice each day – though the quantity issued is not very great.\n\nWe were not allowed to leave our position unmolested. We Signallers \nhad\n were about to form up in line near the quartermasters stores when with \nreceived\n startling precision of shrapnel shell burst overhead. The concussion was\n\nfrightfully severe, the air was filled with acrid & blinding smoke & the shrapnel refuse plugged & zipped in all directions. I distinctly felt the shock & \nwas\n though not actually hit was sent back at least a couple of yds. The regrettable feature of the event was the loss of my old mate Tom Keating, who went down with a lump of iron in his left leg just above the ankle. He accepted his ill-luck with his usual equanimity. That is beyond a few lines of lurid Australian & the hope that the Turks who hit him would roast in hell before him, he simply assumed his broad grin & was carried off with the stretcher bearing swearing at him to keep his leg up. The Pioneer Sergeant, Collins, however, had his right leg badly smashed. The knee cap seemed to have been completely taken off & I noticed his muscles swelling to enormous proportions.\n\nHe was attended to by the Bn. Dr. & I noticed our Chaplain, Capt. Singhe, also present. Collins was a chap I had much taken to, a fellow you could talk to with comradeship & bonhomie, & we were all sorry for him.\n\nWe were quietly \ndeparted\n sent off & after an hours march came to a halt once more in \"Rest Gully\" where we received orders to be in readiness at 6.20 next morning to relieve in the trenches.\n\nI had a rotten time\n\nThursday 26th Aug. 1915\n\nI had a restless night. Our Snipers on the hill above were very active & stray bullets from the enemy were continually plugging into the sand around us.\n\n\"Rest Gully\" is becoming very dirty & a harbour for vermin, rats,\n\ncockroaches, & other lively & multitudinous insects. The dug-outs & terraces with which the limited confines of the place is being adorned are filthy with camp refuse & the continued habitation of so many Soldiers moving in & out has converted some parts of it into veritable dung heaps & rubbish tips. The troops sleep beside these & so their health is precariously endangered. This is a phase of active service conditions \n& outside snipers, bullets, shrapnel\n & no doubt is as great a danger to the lives of the troops as bullets, shrapnel, or bombs.\n\nTo date the good old 20th has suffered seventeen casualties.\n\nWe moved out again at 7 am & taking a circular move from the bottom of the Pass ascended a narrow mule track till we gained the trenches on the heights. Here we found the 8th A.L.H. (Victorians) whom we were to relieve.\n\nThe trenches are an intricate maze & bear evidence of the patient & arduous work of the Sappers. From the hill, one commands a magnificent view of the \nMediterranean\n sea ever still & opalescent. The \"Triumph\" & \"Majestic\" went down not far off. Destroyers steal literally in & out the bay & the guns of \nthe\n battleships, shore howitzers, & field batteries roar in concert. Aeroplanes are active on reconaissance duty over the Turkish lines & I saw one pilot who ventured too low over the enemys fire. The shell burst within some yds of the machine but did no damage.\n\nRe the 8th ALH. what pen can adequately describe the dread tortures of war the gallant body of 600 men have suffered. Thirteen to 15 weeks ago they entered the firing line with big & stout hearts, men in their physical prime & buoyant with enthusiasm & nerve in their work. Today they are a battered & torn regiment – they can muster about 200 whole men, & these are without stamina\n\nor nerve. They have lost their belly. Not that they have turned shirker but it has been knocked out of them. They have done all that men could do against great odds – they have proved themselves heroes. Contrary to my expectations they do not go on furlough but are being moved to another post in the field of operations – Table Top in left flank.\n\nRussells Top at wh we are now stationed has been the scene of heavy & severe fighting. From here the 8th made their disastrous sorties. We have visual evidence of the result of this great charge in the long rows of Turkish & Australian dead that line the trenches not many yds. away. Leiut. Col White & Major Redford fell in this memorable fight & \ntheir\n the body of the latter has only just been recovered in a state of putrefaction for burial. There has been no armistice & the bodies of these brave leaders have lain rotting in the sun for days & days\n\ndespite gigantic efforts on the part of Sappers to get to them. The remains of Major Redford have just been recovered & given decent burial. The remains of L. Col. White are within 10 yds. of our latest sap but the activity of the Turks disallows any attempt to remove them.\n\nThe Turk has become very saucy in his trench fighting wh game he plays \"par excellence\". In close work our men use only periscope rifles. The sharpshooting Turk is a considerable item & it is very unwise to show a head above the trenches.\n\nThe enemy are using a captured French 75 to great advantage. We receive a peppering morning & evening from this big gun. It creates great havoc wherever its shells lodge & blows trenches sky high. Today it has been particularly active & my dug-out is precariously within \n\nits range. This gun gives you no warning, it comes on you like a thunder clap, plugs into earth or stone 3 ft. deep & roars in its explosion like forty elephants run amok.\n\nThey also pump shrapnel into us about twice a day – but as with the 75 it is evident that the ammunition is very limited, otherwise our position would be certainly untenable. Their shrapnel, what they have of it, is very effective - forward 200 yds. by about 100 yds. wide.\n\nOur fellows in the front trenches are suffering & undergoing great trials. \nTheir\n Perhaps their worst enemy is the unendurable stench from the Turkish trenches where \nour own\n the bodies of our heroes lie rotting side by side with those of the enemy. Many are in a state of utter putrefaction & are swollen like poisoned pups\n\nor drowned rats. Our Sappers complain bitterly of the stench & many of them have given up sick at heart & physically overpowered. The swollen bodies at the least touch burst with the report of a rifle & the puss \n& stench\n squirts forward like water from a hose. Many of the bodies are maggoty & eaten away by rats & other vermin & the nauseating odor floats through the trenches with the evening breeze in stifling intensity.\n\nThis afternoon first issue of tobacco – 1 oz. each man, or packet of cigs. Matches also issued.\n","59":"\n\nThere has been fierce fighting on the left flank \ntoward\n in the vicinity of Chocolate Hill & WW Hills. The attack was made at 4 p.m. & was covered by heavy Naval artillery. It raged\n\nfor fully 2 hours. I had a full view of the battle. Terrific & terrible in its realism, \nit was but a flea bite compared\n the more I gazed upon it & its dreadfulness the more I was convinced of the folly of war.\n\nThere have been many such conflicts of late & the wearing down power of successful resistance is becoming each day more intensified. It has now resolved itself into a struggle of the trenches. Our main strategic objective is to cut off the Turkish supplies from the north to the south & so it is a game of patience & moral stamina. It is like hacking at the middle of a great trunk of hardwood & our forward movement must necessarily be laboriously slow.\n\nOur O.C. has just informed me that our of the full complement of 18th Bn. Signallers, only 3 remain intact. This is the result of pushing them into the firing as infantry supports whereas the whole past training has been confined to signalling.\n\nOur rations each day become more varied. We are now receiving bacon, cheese, bread, biscuits, tea, sugar, raisins, rice, beans, onions, potatoes, jam. There is plenty of it also. We each do our own cooking.\n\nThe","60":" Light Horse have but 2 officers & 60 men left. They suffered terribly in the afternoon’s battle.\n","61":"\n\nI made a round of the trenches here yesterday afternoon. Everything is in apple-pie order. The men are happy & contented & for raw soldiers display remarkable nonchalance in the dangers around them. Shrapnel whizzes & bursts overhead, machine guns spit their deadly pellets into the walls everywhere, the big 75 plugs into earth & rock & roars like thunder, yet our fellows spread their blankets out in dug outs & in the open & sleep as peacefully as new-born babes.\n\nThese trenches perched on the summit of a conical hill, 200 ft above the sea level represent to me a township as I have conceived existed in prehistoric days. We crawl in & out our dug-outs like moles & we sleep & live in dust. Some of us have accumulated beards of grotesque proportions & many have a striking resemblance of two-footed creatures I have seen in sketches of the days before Adam. Yet we are all in fighting quick & strong as horses & glad of the opportunity to get at the common enemy.\n\nIt is fitting to pay a tribute to the unremitting attention wh the authorities have paid to the hygiene. All latrines & such like conveniences are under the constant observance of a fatigue party & are daily disinfected or freshly dug so as to preserve to the utmost the good health of the soldiers. In f act, I have smelt less obnoxiousness here than I did at Liverpool in this regard.\n\nThe weather is now becoming cooler, the heat of the day is mildly tempered by soft zephyrs from the Gulf of Saros, the changeless blue of its mirrorlike surface ever smiling & glistening in the bright rays of a perfect golden sun. Towards each morn a light dew descends & heralds the close approach of winter. We have had no rain up to the present.\n\nTonight the rattle of machine guns from the surrounding hills reminds me of a copper on the boil, but magnified 10000 times.\n","62":"\n\nA perfect day – quietness reigns supreme.\n\n3 p.m. spoke to Richards re Report mentioned in Brigade orders for Aus. & N.Z.

I am sorry over it as I have written home such good letters of my expectations. Talking tonight to the Corporals of the Army Medical Corps, an Australian (Perth) who says there is very little chance of an Australian getting promotion here. General Godley likes the New Zealanders. They get the preference before Australians and are particular not to purposely shove an Australian out. It is a fact but a remarkable one too, that there is only one Australian on the general staff, and he is A.D.C. to General Godley and a mere figurehead. He also is a very good fellow without any push or go, should anyone approach him about promotion. Capt. Ryrie I mean. He is a methodical Adjutant, that is all. The New Zealanders command the general staff and run the show yet there is hardly a New Zealander in the Division at present except at Headquarters.

He is not my idea of a real live Lord – in fact I first took him, when I looked at his lapels and saw a military rank, that it was some lost scraggy Tommy come to ask his way.\n","89":"\n\nAm freezing - & late for office – half-an-hour, of wh I was quietly reminded. Am greatly worried about bivouac as weather is too cold for open-air sleeping, besides my \"internal prerogative\" is demanding additional warmth & rest.\n\nPaid £1 in 2 ten shilling currency notes. It was absolutely necessary for me to draw as I had to get my hair cut & razor done up. \n\nWe have now taken up our winter quarters in Otago Gully, a narrow-gutted hollow forming an admirable cul-de-sac for enfilade fire from the north. The camp, \nbivouac\n with its excellently built offices & adjacent sleeping quarters is a tribute to the skill & zeal of the men who composed the working party, but I am afraid too much attention has been paid to detail. The result is that a very elaborate target now presents itself to the enemy – the brow of the gully is crested with dugouts whilst the \"eyebrows\", viz., the western slops is adorned with the multitudinous square-built premises giving accommodation for the General Staff. The whole show is one huge yellow-sandbag patch & must afford an easy target for hostile aircraft. Aeroplane reconnaissance is such a feature of Turkish warfare, it is surprising to me that such a great flamboyancy \nwould have been\n was not prohibited. Only yesterday, recognising the \nneed\n urgent need of dealing or doing something with enemy aircraft, each \nBde.\n Division has been detailed by the Army Corps Commander to allot (2) special machine guns on prominent points to watch for the Taubes. They have become very cheeky of late & fly quite low. We evidently have no anti-aircraft guns to catch them.\n\nThe present stagnation is depressing in its regular monotony. From all centres comes the never-changing report \"situation quiet\". Those in the front trenches do certainly have to keep on the \"qui vive\" for bombs & snipers, but otherwise it seems to be a question of who can last the longest. Both sides seem to be content to dig themselves in, & watch & wait for events. It seems to be a mutual arrangement. The Turks are busy improving their works & are stubbornly entrenching themselves.\n\nThis inactive life is bad for morale. A soldier to be a soldier needs to be incessantly on the move, fighting the common enemy, or if not fighting him, continually aware that he is not for a moment safe from him. In this struggle, the singing of bullets & the bursting & roaring of shrapnel & big guns should never be lost to the men – if the enemy \nwont\n display no desire to fight then they should be made to fight.\n\nThe men should be kept at it \nas long as\n with due respect of course to their physical nourishment in the way of food & rest - & not allowed to \"linger by the wayside\" for a month or two in comparative idleness. By it, they lose the sound of battle they \nbecome\n acquire as it were a growing sense of security \n& become perhaps\n so when the pinch comes \"to go in & win out\" their nerves won’t stand the strain, the transition has \nbecome\n been too severe, too sudden & they have therefore lost their former sting.\n\n6 months here is sufficient for any man – even if he be the purest physical specimen one could clap his eyes on. It is simply a question of luck whether you go down ill or not. It is certainly not a question of physical endurance – the rough life, the unchanging diet, contagion from flies, etc. spells danger \nthroughout\n at any time of the day.\n\nAt present I sincerely believe we are evacuating 200 per cent more sick than wounded every day.\n\nSent 2 Service Cards out each to Dad, Mabel, Grace.\n\nSaturday 25th Sept. 1915\n\nHad a fair night – fleas however were pretty lively – bivouac will be completed today I hope. Capt Ryrie is doing his best in this direction.\n\nA clever piece of work on the enemy’s part is reported from Lone Pine – \"At one part of our line several periscopes and periscopic rifles were hit. On close inspection of the ground a sack was noticed halfway between the enemy’s trenches and our own. This sack was seen to move and finally 2 sacks with men inside were made out. The sacks were fired on and the trouble ceased.\n\nExtract from English Bulletin –","90":" – Gen. mobilisation has been ordered in Bulgaria. \"This does not necessarily imply that Bulgaria has taken the decisive step to liaise with the neutral powers which has been the ultimate object of German diplomacy. Negotiations have been good for some time now with a view to satisfying the legitimate aspirations of Bulgaria and one Government has planned an attack whereby in conjunction with an Austro-German offensive or one mobilisation is only intended to produce stronger opposition though the purpose of negotiation is still doubtful.\"\n\nThe Bulgarian mobilisation is explained by the Bulgarian Minister in London as the beginning of an armed neutrality. The news of the mobilization has caused a great excitement in Athens where a meeting of the Greek Cabinet was summoned by the Premier.

In Champagne after a fresh & very violent bombardment of the trenches\n\nblockbuster, & batteries of the enemy, the French Infantry carried out an assault \nalmost\n against the German line between the Suippe & the Aisne. The enemy’s first line was occupied almost along the entire line of attack. The French advance continues.\n\nThese fragmentary tidings of good news are very welcome & distributed amongst the troops are greatly appreciated. \n\nWe receive daily war office telegrams printed in excellent style on super fine paper, whilst a sheet called the Peninsular Press also comes along at regular intervals giving us news of the progress of European events.\n\nThis interesting printed matter is turned out by the R.E. staff at Imbros.\n\nSunday 26th Sept. 1915\n\nMy \nbivouac\n dug out is finished & is an excellent type of the sandbag shelter used on the peninsula. I am beginning to find work \nvery\n more congenial though the days drag somewhat at times. In fact the same dull routine is repeated each day & the country has acquired an air of quietness relieved only now & again by \nthe shriek of shrapnel in the distance\n an occasional retaliation round from shrapnel rifles which are the only indication that we are actually at war.\n\nThere are two things worth living for in this world – love & war. The worst of it is that you cannot materially enjoy both at the same time. Experience has taught me the bitter truth of all this, when I talk of war or its attractiveness, I don’t refer to gay & happy regiments marching along to the accompaniment of brass bands or the soul stirring notes of the bugle & the medley of pipe & drum. I allude to the roar of thunder & clash of arms of the battlefield, of the silent secrecy of bayonet attacks under cover of darkness when cold steel finds a resting place in the quivering breasts of a thousand an one of our enemies to the shambles of death wh a bright morning reveals in some quiet verdant hollow where the bodies of our brave comrades & those of our enemy lie inextricably mixed to be loosed into a common grave \"unhallowed & unsung\". It may appear somewhat paradoxical that these things should be so loathsome & yet so attractive – the answer is simple yet irrefutable, the men go on & they love it all. The ethics of it I cannot explain. Considered from the true Christian standpoint war is bad. There is nothing in it compatible with biblical law. In battle the savage beast is uppermost & our desire is to slay. We are urged\n\nto kill & so legitimate murder goes on. On the other hand, considered in the practical light of these practical times, war is inevitable & right. And so long as the German & any other of his kinsmen are allowed to wallow in the mire of their own conceit that they can rend & subdue the nations of the earth by rapine, pillage & the murder of innocent souls so long will it be our duty to teach \nhim\n them otherwise - & that can only be accomplished by means of cold steel & shell, & all the dread implements of modern war.\n\nA redeeming feature about this love of war is that it creates a love of home & for dear friends so far away that one has hitherto unknown. It certainly teaches me to appreciate, if it has not done so before, the comfort & serenity of home life, & is an excellent appetizer for the good things that his safe return will bring. It will be like entering the gates of Paradise after a long sojourn in Hell.\n\nI often sit and think of the things that have been, the things that are & well – the chances of the big gamble of life & death ahead. Daily association with modern war is a strict censor of a man’s soul & brings the best out in him, if he be willing.\n\nThis stupendous task in Gallipoli is a nerve trier unparalleled in the history of warfare. Isolated from all civilization, living in holes like rabbits in their burrows, with none of the comforts of the \"billeted\" soldier in France or his opportunity for relaxation, & not a moment of the day secure from the enemy’s aggressiveness, we live in hope – there is no backsliding. Sickness is rife & danger is on every hand, but the morale of the men is unshaken. Victory is ahead & it is their sole objective.\n\nWe received a \"peppering\" of shrapnel at teatime. It knocked out the wireless & killed one poor chap instantaneously, not a dozen yds. away from where I stood.\n","93":"\n\nSent a long letter to Mab. ack hers of 1st Aug.

They have taken by assault the whole village of Souchez and are victorious in the east in the direction of Givenchy & further to the south they have reached La Folie. In Champagne the French have continued to gain ground and after having crossed almost along the whole front of the powerful system of trenches & works constructed & strengthened by the enemy during many months, have advanced \nthe\n towards the north compelling the Germans to fall back on their second line of trenches 3 or 4 kilos in the rear. The Germans have suffered very heavy losses, and have left behind in the abandoned works a considerable quantity of material which has not yet been estimated, but already the capture of 24 field guns is reported.\n\nThe number of prisoners taken increased momentarily & is already 16000 unwounded, of whom at least 200 are officers, & along the whole front during 2 days fighting the allies have captured over 20000 prisoners.\n\nWar Office telegram\n 27\/9\/15 (inter alia). The British attacked the enemy south of La Bassee Canal & captured his trenches on a front of 5 miles, penetrating his lines in some places to a distance of 4000 yds.\n\nThe situation in the eastern front is much more hopeful. The Russians have been able to escape the Germans in the north & to counter attack with energy. They have retaken Vilecken & \nthe\n captured 7 machine guns wh they turned on the fleeing enemy.

Press","94":" \"Official news\".\n\nThe following leading article appeared in the \"Times\" of September 4th:-\n\nHEROISM IN GALLIPOLI\n\nWe may all have our opinion about the strategy that dictated the enterprise in the Dardanelles. But about the behaviour of the men who have been sent to carry it through there can be only one opinion. Mr. Ashmead Bartlett sent us yesterday, and sends us again to-day, an account of attacks by these men – many of them thus tasting battle for the first time – against the Turkish positions round Suvla Bay and in the \"Anzac\" zone. These accounts should serve to make the least imaginative realize the conditions that an army in Gallipoli has to face. The Turks are well entrenched, well supplied with machine guns, well served by an artillery that has proved itself a worthy rival to ours. Our ships, and the batteries that we have been able to land, do their best to make the Turkish trenches untenable. They plaster them with shells, spread a screen of fire before each advance, and lift – as the line goes forward – to make the bringing up of enemy reserves difficult and costly. But the hills of Gallipoli – rising in tiers from the coast, broken by rocky ravines, clothed in stubborn scrub – are ideal for defence. They are held by men who have an old name for dogged bravery in defence – men who fight now with the knowledge that failure means the loss of Constantinople, expulsion from Europe, disgrace to the Crescent. Mr. Ashmead Bartlett has shown what the results are, and we, who have never failed to honour a worthy foe, may give the Turk the praise that is his due. But if we praise him, what shall we say of our own men? Seldom have British soldiers been called upon – with so complete a knowledge of the difficulties confronting them – to face emergencies calling for such sustained endeavour, endurance so long drawn out, faith so unconquerable in the certainty of ultimate victory. Landed on bare beaches under a storm of fire, knowing nothing of the country over which they have to advance, they have gone forward again and again with a stern bravery that has yielded ground only when it was so swept by fire that no living thing could remain. Several times they have actually carried commanding positions, only to be forced to give them up by a hail of destruction that made of stubbornness but a useless sacrifice of life. We speak of them all – Australians, New Zealanders, Indians – as our men. These are ours as much as those who have gone out from among us – as conscious of the call of the race, as proud of our traditions, as resolute to maintain the honour of their country. When we think how all have risen to the height of so arduous an enterprise we find no words that can express our pride in them.

This is the situation today 21 Sept. 1915\n\nTHE MILITARY SITUATION.\n\nDARDANELLES OPERATIONS.\n\nTHE RUSSIAN FRONT.\n\n(From our Military Correspondent.)\n\nThe new landing in the Gallipoli Peninsula, of which authentic information is now available, is an example of how the best laid schemes in war, as in other kinds of human activity, are apt to fall short of achieving complete success. As on the occasion of the original landing on April 25, all the arrangements for seizing the landing-places and disembarking the troops appear to have been thought out to the minutest detail for which foresight could provide, and the experience previously gained was fully utilized. Absolute secrecy, one of the primary essentials in every operation of war, was maintained up to the last moment, even the troops employed being kept in ignorance of their destination until just about to disembark. The landing was effected during \"the darkest hours that precede the dawn,\" and the enemy were completely taken by surprise. Although the Turks knew of the arrival of large reinforcements, and were therefore aware that operations of some kind were projected, they had no clue as to when or where the attack would take place. The troops having been carefully exercised in embarking and disembarking, it was possible to effect both operations in darkness with the least possible risk of confusion and delay. Fresh troops were employed, and all ranks were eager to be in action. The landing was effected without a hitch and with little opposition. The attention of the enemy had been diverted by an attack towards Krithia from the Allies’ main position at the extremity of the Peninsula, and the attack of the Australians and New Zealanders, which was \n\ndesigned to gain ground to the north and join hands with the new offensive, coincided with the arrival of the transports and the disembarkation at Suvla Bay. The new divisions, supported by the fire of the ships, quickly advanced towards the high ground which encircles the bay on the north, east, and south; and there appears to have been no delay in landing and sending forward reinforcements.\n\nTHE HITCH.\n\nThus all the preliminary arrangements went like clock-work, and everything seems to have been in favour of complete success. The Australasian Corps, after desperate fighting, gained the commanding ridges of Sari Bahr and Chunuk Bahr, and it only remained for the advance from Suvla Bay to gain the heights of Anafarta, east and south\u001eeast of the Salt Lake, in order to dominate the entire region. At this stage, for some reason not yet fully explained, a hitch occurred in the proceedings. The advance of the newly-landed force was held up in the low ground east of the Salt Lake, and on the 7th and the following day was unable to make any further material progress towards the main position on the Anafarta ridge, which had meanwhile been strongly occupied by the Turks. In consequence the Australians and New Zealanders were obliged to withdraw from the advanced positions they had gained on the ridges to a line in rear of the crest, where they established themselves firmly. The renewed attack, which was made on the 21st with the aid of reinforcements which had become available in the meantime, was unable to make material progress except on the left of the Australasian line, where a strong position was established about three-quarters of a mile in advance of the original front. The net result of the operations thus far has been that the position gained above Gaba Tepe at the end of April has been extended northwards as far as the shore of the Gulf of Saros beyond Suvla Bay, the total length of the front exceeding twelve miles, while the Turks continue to hold the dominating ridges which command the country towards the open sea on the west and the Dardanelles on the east. But while the new offensive has not achieved the complete success hoped for, the advantage gained by the increased scope for action offered by the\n\nextension of the front must not be overlooked. As the Press Bureau statement issued on Wednesday tersely observed, the ground gained and held is of great value. Nor must the warning contained in the succeeding sentence of the statement be disregarded, that further serious and costly efforts will be needed to secure decisive victory. The Turks, with the help of their German organisers, have developed forces greater than appear to have been anticipated. History is repeating itself in the Dardanelles and driving home the lessons of all our former wars. The General in command has done what he could with the forces at his disposal. His troops have acted up to the finest traditions of the Army. It remains for the nation to provide the means needed, here and elsewhere, to achieve success.\n\n& ready for the word to move. Greece has mobilised & already fighting has taken place on her frontier with the Bulgars. The enthusiastic frenzy of the Greeks in these islands to crowd to the standard of battle against Bulgars borders on madness. They have left their homes, sold their businesses and farms for 25% of their worth & cleared off to join within 24 hrs. of the word to mobilize.\n\nWednesday 6th Oct. 1915\n\nVisit from Gen. de Lisle of 29th Div. stationed up Lala Baba way.\n\nBig naval bombardment of Hills running north from Suvla along coast. Very spectacular – ships from Suvla apparently firing broadsides. Great flashes of vivid flame broke on the hillside as the shells found their mark & huge clouds of dust & debris sent skywards \nas if\n resembling volumes of smoke from burning oil wells. The bombardment lasted about ½ hr. The song of the big shells as they whizzed on their mission of destruction could be distinctly heard from where I stood. It was strikingly akin to the roar of an electric tram coming full speed down hill – in fact I was reminded of the noise of the William St car as it leaves the top of Darlinghurst for the City.\n\nThursday 7th Oct. 1915\n\nWar Office telegram 7\/10\/17\n (inter alia): \"Owing to various obstacles the ultimatum of Russia to Bulgaria was not delivered until Monday afternoon. In Petrograd a satisfactory reply is not expected & it is believed there that the Ministers of the Allies would leave Sofia last night.\"\n\nGerman communique admits that the Russian armies have taken the\n\noffensive on a wide front almost fifty miles in extent from Postawy to Smorgon, on the Vilna-Minsk railway.\n\nThe Russians now appear to be giving the Germans a little of what they gave Napoleon’s Army in its great retreat from Moscow. In many respects the recent advance of the Germans into Russia & their new equable retreat is a striking parallel to the fate of Napoleon’s great invasion (See John Bull article).\n\nI have it from a reliable source that 2 Divisions of French & 1 Greek Division are in local waters, north of Suvla, waiting the decision of Bulgaria.\n\nGen. Godley returns from Mudros.\n\nFriday Oct. 8 1915\n\nWrote Mum letter – characteristic re cook etc.\n\nGen. Godley visited by Sir Ian Hamilton & Gen. Birdwood. Godley with his characteristic blandness met them ½ way down the track and halted each briefly and shook hands.\n\nA Telegram from Petrograd announces that diplomatic relations between Russia & Bulgaria have been broken off.\n\nThere are eruptions in the Greek Cabinet. Owing to a difference of opinion with the Crown, Venizelos resigned office on Tuesday night. The King who accepted the resignation conferred with the leaders of the Political Parties yesterday morning & as a result of their deliberations it was decided to form a coalition Cabinet under the Presidency of Mr. Zaimis, the Governor of the National Bank, Mr. Venizelos being excluded. Mr. Zaimis is an experienced statesman, a former High Commissioner of Crete & a friend of the Quadruple Entente.\n\nRain has threatened all day – the sky has been overcast with filmy lead colored clouds & occasional drops of rain have fell. It seems determined to hang off. I have not seen an hour’s rain since I have been on the peninsula. Whether it’s the weather, diet, or long hours I cannot say, but my whole self is pregnated with a feeling of lassitude & weakness. I’ve had severe spasms of diarrhoea, especially in the early morning, & I have little sleep.\n\nThe work of the office severely drags on me, though I am\n\nentirely at ease regarding it. I have now grasped all details & carry on independently.\n\nThe situation is unchanged. The usual artillery retaliation rounds take place during the day & night, & outside the danger of snipers bullets & the noise of a night demonstration there is nothing to disturb the peaceful serenity of our surroundings. Peaceful! peaceful as far as the native will have it – indeed if \none\n a stranger to the war suddenly happen here when early morn breaks forth in all its glorious radiance over land & sea, he would never credit if you told him that grim death lurked in every valley & on every hill.\n\nSaturday 9th Oct 1915\n\nMirabile ductu.\n\nIt rained & blew hell last night – a most uncomfortable \"preliminary counter\" to what we are to experience in a few weeks.\n\nAs soon as twilight faded away into night, a dense storm wrack \nappeared\n enveloped us with whirlwind intensity as if \nto\n its sole mission was to tear the very vitals from our \nbivouac\n shelters. The black canopy of clouds, wh had lain dormant & high throughout the day, now descended \nupon the ear\n & plunged us into a inky darkness through wh one found it impossible even to grope. Rain poured in torrents as if the gates of Niagara had been let loose, & soon converted the dusty terraces & pathways into quagmires from which our boots could hardly be withdrawn. The wind howled & shrieked like so many aerial devils & many a primitive dug-out was mangled & torn to shreds.\n\nI was in the office when the storm broke & I \nhave a\n shall always retain a very vivid memory of my struggle in the inky blackness to reach my \nbivouac\n dug-out. The storm did not materially affect it however, though I spent an hour hanging on like grim death to the tarpaulin roof which was swelling ominously with each gust of wind. Early morn saw the disturbance spent of its fury.\n\nSunday 10th Oct 1915\n\nThe glorious tenth – 28 years ago saw me in swaddling clothes. If I were given my life again would I live that life again?\n\nAn uneventful day – sent Field Service Cards to Mum, Grace & Mab to remind them I am well – and I know they will all be thinking of me.\n","106":"\n\nExperienced a rain storm about midday – quickly passed over but was very severe while it lasted. Captain Mair has arrived as GSO 3 vice Captain who has been here only a couple of days & has now gone to GHQ. Capt. Mair is just from France where he secured the Military Cross. A long lank attenuated Irishman, keen & full of life, & a gentleman every inch of him. Quite distinct to Capt. – who was for ever twisting an exceply. pretty little mo’ & took more pains with his toilet than interest in his work. He was also from France – but the vista of the life here did not suit his particular fancy. There was nothing here compatible with the conditions he had enjoyed in France. \"Damn it all\" he remarked \"one does get tuned up with shell there, but you could get a drink occasionally & secure a comfortable bed. Why Divisional Hqrs. in France is about 11 miles back from the firing line, in an up-to-date spanking house & you have your motor cars, jolie demoiselles, etc.\" \"And what the devil becomes of the mail here. In France we have it at least once a day, some times twice, oh dear me, this is the last place God made.\" And he walked to the door & gazed mournfully at the scene before him. Nothing but stunted gorse, & civilization nowhere.\n\nCapt. Herbert has gone sick with dysentery. Ex consular service at Constantinople & a hero of Mons, the Hon. Aubrey Herbert MP was a characteristic figure while in camp. Tall & thin, with small head nestling to his shoulders with unbecoming severity, he appears to be in a state of perpetual effervescence. His face is never rigid, it is for ever crinkled with a smile & laughter \n& good fellowship\n His eyes are small dark & beady, & short-ranged, an aftermath of his trials in France – his sight has been practically destroyed by high explosives. So, poor fellow, they are continually getting him into trouble because his feet are naturally crosswise & two such physical defects must inevitably clash. But he displays wonderful agility for all that.\n\nHe dresses in a mauve-colored suit of high sartorial cut. He talks with the full flavor of British aristocratic ton - & is dreadfully careful of his hair, teeth & finger nails. His external effeminacy you would never associate with an hero of the battlefield. He is a living example of the hero of the modern melodramatic novel. He is always talking of the latest hair wash, pomades, & perfumes & you can always tell his whereabouts by the trail of violet that follows him. He indulges in Turkish delight & often makes of a meal of it in preference to roast beef & potatoes. He uses eau-de-cologne galore. A cheerful conversationalist, & spins many a good yarn. There is no excessive aristocrat about him, but his talk displays a ready wit & a brilliant brain. He is never bored or wearied & always gets what he wants. If he does not succeed at first he sticks at what he’s after till he gets it. A good trier & a bold soldier. \"If you can’t get anything from someone you particularly desire, make love to them\" is one of his witticisms & he has found it fairly successful by experience.\n\nCapt. Herbert has the reputation of being the finest I.O. on the Peninsula. Spoke to Maj. Pinwill re my rank. He represented the matter to Capt. Thomas, DACG. who said that I would be for Corp. – that’s all he can do for the present, as the General won’t sanction Australians receiving rank of Sgt in this Division because the NZ Sgt gets less money. Rather illogical \nbut\n as the Div. is as much Aust. as N.Z – in fact the whole thing is absurdly weak & would not stand investigation. Capt. Thomas says we will probably get a Sergeant rank later on: at any rate I am satisfied, for if I secure the Corporal rank it carries with it 10\/- a day, & that is all I want. It is only another striking instance of the clash between New Zealanders and the Australians given they set out to run the Division with New Zealanders, and now find that they cannot do without the Australians, who slander them as much as possible and defer their progress. We do the work and do it better than the New Zealanders on their own show and we should get our rank and privileges. The whole business requires thorough investigation. It would then fall to the ground like a bag of grass.\n\nA distinguishing feature of the night operations lately has been the work the Australian patrols – 7th B. (Col. Burston) – they have penetrated the enemy’s lines at night and actually sneaked in and out their trenches with wonderful daring and skill. They successfully reconnoitred the enemy’s position at the \"Apex\" and entered the blockhouse there. This work has been commended by General Godley, much I suppose to his disgust and the envy of the rest of the English general staff.\n\nThe cold callousness of those Australians to danger is typified by the following incident – a Turkish deserter – Suleman Achmud – who walked in & laid down his arms a couple of days back, when asked the question as to whether the Turks saw any of our patrols at night he answered \"only when we saw them smoking cigarettes\". Though this is an unpardonable crime for a soldier on patrol duty it only conveys a slight conception of what these fellows \nare prepared to do to\n do. They are utterly reckless & never think of the imminent danger surrounding them – they stand up in their trenches & lean over & show half a body to get a better smack at a Turkish sniper or other enemy target – they ignore & brush aside all regulations governing trench fighting. They take their own initiative & perhaps their continued success has been \ndue\n a great deal due to this. \"They are too eager\", said an artillery officer of 25 years experience the other day, \"yet they are brilliant soldiers\".\n\nWith regard to the Turkish prisoner mentioned above, he walked into the trenches at the head of the Sazli Beit Dere at dawn & with a characteristic expression of disgust, threw down his rifle & said \"me finished\". He was a tall big lump of a fellow, a Roumeliote from Adrianople. Under examination he said that the Turks had been told that England had asked for peace & that Germany was now arranging her indemnity. The Turks were all wanting peace – the food was bad, no water or very little, no meat & no bread – beans now & again. He said \"if you break a bone or a finger of every Turk you find friendship in it for the English\" & he added with\n\nreference to the Turkish losses wh had been very severe, \"In Roumelia, \nwhere\n there are now 12 women looking for husbands where there only used to be six\". This is a sample of the characteristic talk of the Turk under examination.\n\n12th Oct 1915\n\n\"I have lost the track of what world I am living in\n\nOf what day I am seeing,\n\nI only know that there is blue about\n\nThe blue of your eyes\n\nI only know there is music somewhere\n\nWords quick & broken that you have said.\"\n\nRecomdn. for promotion goes to Army Corps.

He landed near the salt lake, Suvla, & was subjected to heavy machine gun & shrapnel fire.\n\nP.P. 12\/10\/15\n\nWireless Messages\n\nPetrograd, Oct 4.\n\nThe Russian Minister at Sofia has been ordered to hand to Dr. Radoslavoff, President of the Council, the following note:-\n\n\"Events are happening in Bulgaria which show the final resolve of the Government of King Ferdinand to place the fate of the country in the hands of the Germans. The presence of German and Austrian officers in the Ministry of War and on the Headquarter Staff, the concentration of troops in the zone abutting on Servia, the substantial financial assistance accepted by the Bulgarian Cabinet from our enemies: all these admit of no further doubt as to the object of the present military preparations of the Bulgarian Government. The Entente Powers, who have at heart the realization of the aspirations of the Bulgarian people, have many times warned Dr. Radoslavoff that any hostile act against Servia would be considered to be hostile to the Entente Powers. The prodigal assurances given by the Bulgarian Minister in reply to these warnings are contradicted by the facts. The representative of Russia, tied to Bulgaria by the imperishable memory of the latter’s liberation from the Turkish yoke, cannot sanction by his presence agressive fratricidal preparations against an allied Slav people. Consequently the Russian Minister has received orders to leave Bulgaria with all his Staff and Consuls, if within 24 hours the Bulgarian Government does not openly break with the enemies of the Slav cause and of Russia and does not take immediate steps to remove officers belonging to the armies of the States which are at war with the Entente Powers.\"\n\nOct 8.\n\nThe Bulgarian reply to the Russian note not being considered satisfactory, diplomatic relations have been broken off.

The wireless station on the ridge just above us, not 100 yards away, had special attention, & one of the aerials was destroyed. It was however soon repaired.\n\nThe evening bombardment created a mild change from the lethargy of the last few nights. The dull boom of the Turk gun as it sent its awful missile on its voyage of destruction gave us sufficient warning to allow us to take cover & we crouched & anxiously waited whilst we could hear the eerie song of the shell as it cleft the air in its approach. And as we crouched we all prayed that it might go over – out to sea anywhere but where we were. At last it came with an awful whizz as of a sudden burst of steam from a huge exhaust, it came like a meteor from the heavens & plugged with a terrific deep-throated roar into the side of the hill not a dozen yards away.

Leaning his excellent frame of muscle & bone against the sandbag wall, with his arms akimbo, he told his story to his attentive audience with extreme fascination using his well cultured voice with admirable modulation, expressively & earnestly, now speaking in an awed whisper, then raising his voice to express abhorrence of some dastardly act. His intonation was perfect, & all the while his well cut features worked in harmony with his utterances. He told his story as an actor would speak his dramatic lines, as an histrionic master would recite a soul-stirring poem. I shall endeavour to give the story as told by the Col. \"Well the --- was a cranky ill-fitted & equipped old tub, the best you could get out of her being 6½ knots. She was without wireless, few boats, & life-saving appliances, belts etc were nil. She left Alexandria a few days back loaded with Indian reinforcements, in the charge of 5 Indian Reserve\n\nArmy officers, for Gallipoli, via Mudros. The Capt, a good fellow, was well-aware of the seriousness of his task with such a cranky rotten boat, but he was there to obey orders. He determined to carry them out. He knew full well that the enemy submarines had been accounting for an average of 2 transports weekly on the Alexandria-Mudros run for the last 2 months.\n\nWell, the \nRamazon\n Rameses left Alexandria, under orders to take a definite course which was judged to be the only safe course. Lo & behold, before she was 3 miles out, a picket boat came bounding along the ship’s side with sealed despatches. The Captain hurriedly tore them open & to his amazement found that his course had been altered – he was to go round the south of Crete & then steer north – quite opposite to his original orders. It was a rather significant sign, though perhaps not fully appreciated at the time, that the paper giving the altered course was not officially signed, only the covering memo bore signature. This was contrary to set rules governing despatches of the kind, but the Capt believed everything to be OK, & so off he started on the new trail.\n\nThey reached Crete safely \n& turning with\n & were well on their way north before anything happened. The unexpected came like a bolt from the blue. It was early morn, the sea was in an oily calm, & not a breath of wind disturbed its surface; & then the two ominous & dreaded black objects suddenly appeared on the surface not half a mile away, one to right & the other to the left. The ship was caught in a cleft stick. The alarm was immediately given, & the troops crowded the decks & rushed for – alas, the much-needed but missing life belts & boats. They were welcomed instead with a terrific fusillade of shot & shell from a quick firer & rifles on each submarine which swept broadcast the deck of the ill-fated vessel with callous & brutal butchery. Five boats were only available. These were launched as quickly as possible, but two were so riddled with bullets that when they touched the water they simply \nturn\n filled & turned turtle emptying the poor devils of occupants into the icy sea. The Captain was the last to leave the ship & after a hard struggle reached one of the seaworthy boats which had been successfully launched. The submarine lost no time in putting a couple of deadly torpedo into the doomed vessel & she \nsank within\n blew up & sank with a gurgling roar in five minutes after she had been struck. Three boats had managed to get away, luckily they had some filled water kegs aboard – otherwise their occupants would certainly have died\n\nthen & there from downright thirst – as not even a biscuit could be found among them. Most of the \nmen\n survivors had been wounded & one Officer had several bullets in his legs. He had been capsized out of one of the overturned boats, & how he managed to keep afloat long enough to be picked up \nremains\n was a miracle. There were 2 or 3 officers amongst the saved – the others were Indians & some of the vessel’s Dago crew.\n\nNothing could be done but make for a barren bit of an island which loomed on the horizon. After a long & bitter struggle, the \nwet, clothed & sodden\n sodden clothed, starved & thirsty survivors reached the shore. They found it to be habited only by a few ignorant Greek shepherds with goats who treated them with marked hostility & refused them food. No explanation of their misery or condition would make the blasted Dagos give them any help. So they found snails on the beach & lived on them.\n\nOne of the Dago crew volunteered to take a message to a cable station which he knew some miles away & taking one of the boats he succeeded in reaching the island from where an urgent message was sent to the Authorities for assistance. A reply came that a cruiser would be despatched at once. The Greek brought the reply back to the stranded wretches & after they had showed it to the inhospitable \nDago\n inhabitants, they reluctantly killed a couple of goats on which the hungry survivors made a ravenous meal. Evidently, the fear of what vengeance the cruiser might enact upon them on her arrival stirred the blighters to \nsome\n give some kind of help.\n\nThe cruiser ultimately arrived – she was a foreigner unfortunately, but she afforded what help she could & took the \nunhappy\n them away to the nearest port where proper attention could be given. A remarkable incident of the voyage back was that the Dago Surgeon on the cruiser refused to amputate one of the legs of the officer who was bleeding to death from a jagged shell wound. \nWhen\n He agreed to give an \n\nanaesthetic if anyone else could be found to do the job, whereupon, rather than see his friend die before his eyes, another of the belated officers who also had half a dozen wounds about him, & who was the only other Dr available, consented to sit up or be propped up, & performed the operation with the blood oozing from his own agonising wounds whilst he sawed the right leg off his \nsorely\n stricken chum.

One paddle steamer – a tug – lay high & dry on the beach below No. 2 Post & the Turks lost no time in getting on to it with big shells, but they made very poor practice. They also turned the machine guns on to the men aboard her & they were compulsorily obliged to abandon her.\n","127":"\n\nNothing eventful.\n","128":"\n\nReceived letter from Mabel dated 19 Sept. also 2 Sunday Times &\n","129":"\n\nAck.

Out of 380 Indian troops aboard 75 were saved, together with 28 of the crew.\n\nThere is no truth the Press Bureau states in the report that Lord Kitchener has resigned. He has been sent on a special mission by the Govt. and his duties at the War Office are being temporarily discharged by Mr. Asquith.\n","132":"\n\nI have been joined in the office by Sgt. Wakeland who has been sick in hospital at Alexandria.\n\nTroops who have been resting at Mudros are gradually returning & will all be back by the end of the week, viz., 9th AIB., N.Z.M.R. Bde., & N.Z.I. Bde. The 7th AIB will then go to its own Division – 2nd H. Division the right.\n\nMr. Cross, General Rhodes’ Private Secretary, has left for Mudros where he will wait the arrival Colonel. Cross was a great joke here. I was not surprised at his leaving so soon. He soon found out not all violets, he made great fuss when he could not get more than one blanket to cover his precious frame. He was the anniversary of his service in the New Zealand Government and I am sure he left here for the safer waters of Mudros because flying bullets & shrapnel might cut off the chance of his enjoying the \"fruits\" in the shape of a magnanimous position of this Civil Service life. He was a typical old woman with about as much cheek as a \n\na scorched mosquito & as much brain as an addled drunk. He kept well clear of the firing line except when absolutely obliged to accompany Col Rhodes on his morning jaunts round the trenches. I’ve no doubt he will go back & tell glowing tales & fill the \"Morning press\" of NZ with his wonderful exciting experiences at the front of his brave comrades in arms, of his thousand an one narrow squeaks from awful death.\n\nIt is announced by the War Office that K.K. has left England for a short visit to the eastern theatre of war.\n\nAs yet there is no definite news of a settlement of the Greek crisis. Reports as to whether M. Zaimis will, or will not, form a Cabinet are contradictory. The Entente powers have through the Russian Minister in Athens, informed the Greek Govt of the spirit in which they view the trend of events.\n\nThe police yesterday raided the \"Globe\" newspaper and seized the plant.\n\nBy wireless\n (P.O. 8\/10\/15) The resignation of the Greek Govt after the refusal of the Chamber to pass a vote of confidence in the Zaimis Cabinet, raises once more the constitutional question between King Constantine (brother in law of the Kaiser) & Parliament. At the general election in June M. Venizelos was returned with a majority of 63 over the possible combinations, but the illness of the King was made the excuse for postponing the meeting of the new Parliament until late in August when M. Venizelos again accepted the Premiership. The Greek Army was mobilised on Sept. 26 & on Oct. 2nd M. Venizelos announced that Greece would stand by her treaty with Serbia if the Bulgarians attacked the Serbians. King Constantine refused to recognise this treaty as binding. M. Venizelos thereupon resigned & a new Cabinet pledged to neutrality was formed on Oct. 8 under the leadership of M. Zaimis. The Chamber rejected the vote of confidence by a majority of 33 and a dissolution of Parliament was expected.\n\nA telegram from Athens on Nov. 5 states that\n\nKing Constantine has summoned the party leaders to a conference of the political situation.\n\nA later telegram announced the formation of a new Cabinet with M. Skouloudis as Prime Minister in place of M Zaimis who ceased to hold any portfolio.\n","133":"\n\nSerbia through her representatives in London has issued an appeal to her friends in Great Britain begging that help will be sent to her quickly. \"Serbia has been condemned to death by the Germans, Austrians, and Bulgarians\" says the Serbian Minister \"over 20 days our common enemies have been trying to annihilate us. In spite of the spirit of our soldiers our resistance cannot be expected to be maintained indefinitely.\" Franco\u001eBritish Forces are said to have reached a point 90 miles north of Salonika but it is doubtful if they can join the Serbians in time to prevent them from being annihilated.\n","134":"\n\nIt is officially reported that British troops moving northwards from Salonika have joined hands with the Serbians, and that a Russian Army of 250,000 is on its way to Bulgaria.\n\nNegotiations between Great Britain & Sweden (vide Stockholm message) with a view to agreement on commercial questions have been broken off.\n\nThe \"Times\" states that Gen Joffre came to London to discuss the Balkan situation. & to arrive at a complete understanding with regard to the military policy on all points & to an understanding of giving rapid help to Serbia.\n\nLondon by wireless Nov. 8\n Lord Kitchener has conferred with Gen Joffre and the Premier\n\naccording to Paris newspapers. Kitchener’s conference in Paris has produced a thorough understanding with the French Govt. K of K will visit Dardanelles, Egypt, Macedonia, Greece.\n\nThe Greek Cabinet has been reconstructed & it will maintain an attitude of very benevolent neutrality towards Entente.\n\nToday has been a day of events locally. Our feeling of security from enemy fire in this little hollow wh we call Otago Gully has been decisively shattered in one short hour. Our palatial & comfortable home wh has been erected at so much pain & with such diligent care and made so beautiful to the eye with its large sandbag offices covered with varied colored tarpaulins along its parallel tiers of terraces has lost all its romantic calm serenity & been practically wiped out in places by terrific shell fire. The enemy have found us out. That they have not been fully aware of our delightful abode before this, I have not doubted such \nfor\n a thing for a moment. But we have been lulled into a false sense of security because of their supposed lack of ammunition, & we have failed to take the necessary precautions against bombardment, viz. by digging into the bowels of the earth & making tunnels of retreat, which are the only safeguards against the tremendous lumps of metal wh the enemy are now launching at us with apparent prodigal expenditure.\n\nSince Bulgaria declared war Turkey has been steadily reinforcing her ammunition supplies, & we are now receiving the full benefit of it. We have been warned about it & our inactivity is costing us dear.\n\nThe bombardment opened about 3 pm – whirr, whirr, whirr – then simultaneously a number of terrific explosions which made the earth tremble beneath our feet. Then an interval of 2 or 3 minutes. Then more of the huge metal monsters billeted themselves amongst us – one completely wrecked the General’s dining room & shattered the\n\nadjoining Officers mess. In 2 seconds they had become a \nshambles\n heap of smoking ruins – sandbags perched on top of one another at indescribable angles, twisted, scorched & burning timber beams shattered chairs & tables – everything confusion, everything wrecked beyond repair. And if it had occurred an hr. later, the whole of the Gen Staff would have had their names added to the Roll of Honours for afternoon tea is served at 4 pm and is invariably attended by all Staff Officers, from GOC & his distinguished afternoon visitors. \nfrom Colonel down to Capts. etc.\n\nThe bombardment continued incessantly for an hour during wh time our lives were worth not a straw. The air was full of flying shell caps, jagged lumps of steel & burning metal, & the rank smoke and fumes were nauseating and stifling to nigh suffocation.\n\nThe Turks had turned 8.2 howitzers on to us & were firing rapidly & with deadly accuracy. Our tin & waterproof roofs, & sandbag shelters were of little avail against the huge monsters wh they poured into us. Their size may be judged by a hole wh one tore in the terrace outside the Artillery Cmdrs dug-out. It was fully 6 ft deep with a diameter of fully 12 ft. Beyond the great damage to the offices etc., nothing serious resulted. It was miraculous that there was no death or injured roll. The wireless station office over the hill was completely demolished & 3 men there were buried alive by falling earth & other debris. They were dug out uninjured, though suffering very much from shock. Their nerve system has been blasted for ever.\n\nI had rushed out of the office when the first shell burst & took timely shelter behind the front sandbag wall. It was poor protection against opposition but I had nothing else to do but take my chances like the rest. Some however had considered discretion the better part of valor & cleared out of the camp to neighbouring trenches & saps.\n\nThe result of the bombardment has had the effect of accelerating the work in connection with the digging of \"funk\" holes, & by 5 o’clock 4 more had been commenced by special working parties from the trenches.\n","135":"\n\nThe Turks don’t intend to give us any peace. Shortly after 8 o’clock this morning they again opened on us & with deadly effect. Their second shell wiped out 4 men & seriously inured two others & one fell swoop. This party of men had commenced to dig a tunnel from the back of their \nbivouac\n dug-out ½ way up the hill: they had only got a few feet in when with a deafening roar the huge missile of death plugged cleane through the roof above them & then blew the poor devils to bits, one other chap was blown clear out of the door: he was blackened with powder from head to foot like a stoker just issuing from the grimy depths of a huge stokehole. He was completely blinded with grit & fumes from the shell & his eyes have been permanently injured. His shirt & trousers were hanging in shreds & he was trembling like a leaf in the wind. He was crying out incoherently & soon fell down in a deep swoon.\n\nOrders were quietly given that all should clear out till the shelling was over, & the command was quietly & very willingly obeyed.\n\nThe shelling was continued for about an hour, then stopped as suddenly as it had commenced.\n\nWork of tunnelling continues with unabated vigor, day & night, shafts 20 to 25 ft being sunk, from which branch tunnels are being spread out. Two exits will be provided to each tunnel. These are the only safe precautions against howitzers. They can search every nook & cranny of this gully. They fire into the heavens & come down practically at right angles. Gad! this is war. Give me bullets with a chance to smack back any day in preference to this \"rat-in-the-trap\" destruction & murder. Crouch where you may above ground you are not safe from these monsters.\n\nYou hear their weird song which sings them on their way, & it becomes intensified as they approach nearer but you don’t know where they are going to land. It is impossible to locate them until they have struck, & then up goes everything within their reach. The concussion is frightfully & powerfully intense & you are lifted about as if you were a mere straw. What puny mites we are & how helpless one feels against these mighty engines of war. \"Dig\" is Kitchener’s advice, & that is the only advice. Hide yourself in the bowels of the earth.\n\nCapt. C.W. Melvill, New Zealand Staff Corps, has arrived & taken the place of Capt. Mair as GSO (3). He tells many interesting & amusing tales of his experiences in France 12 months ago in the battle of the Aisne & other stupendous struggles in the early stages of the war. He had his arms & legs lacerated by H-E, & had 4 months in hospital in England.\n\nHis recital of instances of the brutal callousness of German methods of warfare were to a degree more repulsive than I have read of despite the horribleness of some of the latter \nhave been\n.\n\nHe tells us of German officers entering quiet homes of the villagers & stabling their horses in the dining & drawing rooms tying them up to pianos, bedsteads, etc., & generally converting the houses into dung pits & cesspits for their filthy excreta – being blackguardly plunder & desecration of beautiful homes.\n\nSent Lil picture P.
