To make things worse there was a sand storm & it was as much as the engine could do to pull the empty trucks.

Afterwards went out to the 14th Genl Hospital Abbassia & saw several of our boys there. They find it very lonely & they are glad to see anyone they know. Listened to the band in the gardens in the afternoon & had dinner there. Cairo has changed very much. Nearly all the old places of amusement are closed as there are so few troops to patronise them.\n","12":"\n\nWe left Cairo by the 7 am train & got to Kantara after 11 am. Managed to get room on the desert train for the goods, so got them over to East Kantara & loaded on the 10 to 6 pm train. Kantara is an immense place now, the most important on the canal At Gilban we saw one of the new “tanks”. Several of them are here & we are wondering how Johnny Turk will like this. We spent all night on \n\nFebruary 1917\n\nthe train & reached El Arish just before daybreak & unloaded the goods. On inquiring I found the Regiment were at Mazar & wouldn’t be coming on to El Arish for some days. I left a guard on the stuff & came back to Mazar & was told to bring it back. Whilst at El Arish a mine was washed up on shore. A machine gun tried to explode it but failed so a mountain gun was brought down & it fixed the mine up. Went off with a great roar. \n\nTwo soldiers bathing got caught in the undertow & several attempts failed. An Australian went in on his horse & got them out. It was a good bit of work. A Taube aeroplane came over but our guns gave it a warm time & it didn’t drop any bombs. The Egyptian Labour Corps are very frightened of the bombs & they run about like “lost sheep”. They get silly with terror. A previous night air raid accounted for about 60 of them, mostly through their foolishness. I saw 18 Turkish prisoners\n\nFebruary 1917\n\nbrought in. Many have given themselves up since Rafa. They seem fairly well clothed & in good condition, but they were very hungry & thirsty.\n\nFebry 5th\n\nGot back to Mazar with the goods. Sent over to the camp for 2 timber waggons & soon had the things in the camp. We expect to be at Mazar only a few days. The farriers are very busy shoeing, so it looks like hard country for us.\n\nFebry 6th\n\nWe are just doing a few patrols & a little outpost work & as the whole Brigade are here, it is very easy. The amount of work done out this way since we were here last is wonderful. It speaks wonders for British energy & organisation. Turkey’s chances of getting into Egypt are getting more & more remote. It can never be more than a dream of theirs now. At night the Royal Welsh Fusiliers gave a Concert in the YMCA tent & it proved one of the best I have yet heard in Egypt. Their part singing was splendid. Many of their songs were sung in their own tongue, but that did not stop us from\n\nFebruary 1917\n\nAppreciating them.\n\nFebry 7th\n\nEnemy planes bombed El Arish.\n\n 8th\n\nMarched out of Mazar at 9 am. We did an easy march of 15 miles & arrived at Bardawil at 4 pm, getting fresh water for our horses which they appreciated after poor well water at Mazar. Bivouacked at Bardawil for the night – got a good rum issue.\n\nFebry 9th\n\nLeft Bardawil at 9.30 am & travelled about 7 miles along the coast: passed the aerodrome. Nearly any time there are 3 or 4 planes continually “up” & the aerodrome is busy place We reached Masaid, our destination, about 4 miles on the canal side of El Arish Masaid is a large palm grove (Hod) of about 750 acres in extent, by far the largest palm grove I have seen on the desert. There is beautiful water in the wells also fresh water laid on. The New Zealanders, 3rd Light Horse Brigade & Camelry are also camped here. There are also canteens & a big YMCA.

Our Brigade is in the 1st Division & we have one English Yeomanry Bgde with us. The 2nd Division consists of ½ Australian L Horse & the other half Yeomanry. The reason I think is that they can divide the work better so that one cant boast over the other. The Anzacs previously had nearly all the work, honor & glory & even the natives were beginning to compare the Yeomanry & Light Horse & such native expressions as Australia good ! English no good ! We are all sorry to lose our name, but we will still be on the job & it might make things easier\n\nAt night a concert was held.

It was a bad morning. About 4 am a thick blanket of fog screened everything & progress was very slow. We gave our horses every opportunity of getting all the green feed they could get & there are some splendid crops in this part. We made a wide circling movement & came in contact with the enemy about 2 miles East of the Gaza Beersheba Road. Their patrols were driven back & some of them captured. On reaching the road we captured the Turkish commandant & quite a number of Turks. Enemy aeroplanes came\n","59":"\n\nlow & fired on us, but we returned it & every time drove them off. A big Turkish gun tried to pick us up, but we changed direction & pushed right in behind Gaza cutting off all communication, & capturing more prisoners. In the afternoon our infantry attacked Gaza, but it was too strongly held & only one redoubt was captured by the N Zealanders who galloped across an open grass plain & dismounted & charged with bayonets. It was a great sight. The whole fight seemed more like a big parade ground movement From a hill behind the town we could see everything, all the troops & artillery moving into position & the charge across the plain. It was a pity it wasn’t successful, everything seemed to be so well carried out.\n\nOur Brigade held off reinforcements & worried the Turks from the rear. We inflicted a lot of casualties among the Turks, one of our machine guns wiping out whole company. Two guns were captured. The 5th LH had a bayonet charge on horseback. We remained behind Gaza till 10.30 pm\n","60":"\n\nThe Turks sent up large reinforcements & the","61":" LH Brigade gave them a warm time & stopped them from reaching Gaza till next morning. During the night we withdrew across the Wadi el Ghuzze as we were liable to get cut off & at daylight returned to camp. The fighting had been severe & losses on both sides were considerable.

We watered our horses & had a spell all day.\n","62":"\n\nShifted camp near to the water & it was great to get a swim & a good wash again.

They look very formidable & are heavily armoured & armed. They are all named, such as “Lion”, “Tiger” “War Baby” “Pincher” etc & some of them carry 6 pounder guns. They ought to give Jacko a surprise in a few days.\n\nTuesday 3rd\n\nThe Turks opened up a lively artillery fire first thing in the morning. For some reason our own guns did not reply for some time, but when they did Jacko soon knocked off. Under cover of his artillery he sent out a strong party but they were heavily punished.\n","70":"\n\nFinished up with the camels & transported myself back to the Squadron. The Brigade went out on 24 hrs outpost in the afternoon. We were expecting a bombing attack to day & our aeroplanes were up all the time, but the bombs did not eventuate.\n","71":"\n\nThe day was very warm, so enjoyed a good swim.

The 7th got a cavalryman but except for his sword & boots his equipment wasn’t very good\n","76":"\n\nThe day was very warm. The brigade moved out at 11.30 to go out on outpost before the Turkish post at Weli Sheikh Nuran \n","77":"\n\nThe Brigade got back into camp at 3 pm & we soon got the dust off us by a plunge into the sea.

Heard that the Scotties captured a Turkish outpost & some machine guns also that a German spy had been captured in our lines dressed as an Australian officer. He was inspecting gun positions. Our Brigade brought in 2 Turks & 2 Bedouins today A watch from home arrived by packet registered post.\n","79":"\n\nOur guns were more active today. There was plenty of aerial activity\n","80":"\n\n& much anti fire. We had gas drill in the afternoon. Australian parcels & papers arrived today.\n\nSaturday 14th\n\nEarly in the morning the enemy shelled the rail head with his long range guns. Little damage was done but the big clearing hospital got a few shells & had to shift to a more sheltered spot. Enemy aeroplanes dropped some bombs near the beach. Some of them fell in the sea a mile from the shore. The minesweepers created some interest in the afternoon. They were firing at something in the sea, but we couldn’t see what! Our Regt moved out at 4 pm to support the Yeomanry on outpost.\n","81":"\n\nThe Regt got back into camp at 8 oclock. We were covered in dust & after breakfast we took all the horses into the sea.\n","82":"\n\nAs a bombardment was expected we shifted our horses a couple of miles back for a few hours. In the afternoon we prepared to move out. It was 8 oclock when we left. The whole Division was moved together & we travelled all night reaching Shellal just after daylight. The ride was\n","83":"\n\nhardly a pleasure trip. The dust was blinding & choking & the halts & interruptions frequent. In addition the night was cold & we were all tired. We watered in the Wadi & it was just then 2 enemy aeroplanes spotted us & down came the bombs. One killed & wounded 20 men & 18 horses, most of them belonging to Brigade Headquarters. The day \nMonday\n Tuesday 17th was very hot with hardly a breath of air. We got no time to boil any tea & nearly everyone was suffering a good deal. \n\nAfter frequent halts of varying lengths we got into touch with the Turks near Abu Hareira there was a bit of a skirmish & some artillery fire. We got a good well with splendid water. After dark we came back & camped near the Wadi. It was 11.30 when we got to sleep.\n\nWednesday 18th\n\nWe were out again at daylight, watered our horses & managed to get a shave & a wash. A plane came over & dropped more bombs but did no damage. We went out again towards Abu Hareira, got in touch with the Turks & stayed there till dark.\n\nApril 1917\n\nMore bombs were dropped & both the NZs & the artillery lost some men & horses. After dark we watered & fed & drew our rations & at 11 oclock left the wadi & travelled to Jemmi which took us all night. We were all very weary & many went to sleep on their horses At every halt men used to throw themselves on the ground & were immediately asleep.\n\nThursday 19th\n\nA heavy bombardment started at daylight & nearly all day there was a continuous roar of guns. We were in support of the 3rd Brigade. The fighting was very stiff, the Turks proved to be exceptionally strong, both in men, guns & position. We were bombed in the morning, 1 bomb falling in the centre of B Squadron. Fortunately no one was hit. In the afternoon we were heavily bombed & shelled. The Turks using 2 big guns about 8 in. The 3rd Bgde lost heavily. The fighting on our part was in the open. The Turks in redoubts. They must have lost heavily with our artillery fire as it was very heavy. The warships were also firing. Our infantry took\n\nApril 1917\n\nGaza but had to leave it again. The 5th &","84":" Light Horse had a scrap with the Turkish cavalry & punished them. They had to leave because the Turks brought up some mountain guns & shelled the horses. We had only a few men wounded with bombs & shells.

At the same time the other British plane dived & fired but suddenly \nplane\n it broke into smoke & turned over & over like a fluttering piece of paper & fell to the ground.\n\nWe got back to the wadi at 10 oclock & had a few hours sleep. We had only 5 hrs sleep the whole time since Sunday night & I don’t think any of us before had had such a strenuous time.\n\nFriday 20th\n\nThe Turks during the night advanced to the Wadi & our troops drove them back & took a well they had occupied.

They flew very low & one of ours was brought down by shell fire We moved to another camp & got to sleep at about 9 oclock.\n","87":"\n\nDid nothing all day except a 3 mile trip for water.

Came back to Weli Sheikh Nuran watered, fed & got our rations & went out a couple of miles on outpost.\n","89":"\n\nAt daylight B Troop went on patrol. We passed through several villages & gardens. We could hardly get\n\nApril1917\n\nthrough in places on account of the maze of Turkish trenches. We came across herds of cattle & the natives taking off their crops. The natives must live in the fields for all the mud houses are deserted & show no signs of recent habitation. Wood is very scarce but we managed to get some as our patrols hadn’t been over the same ground before. There was no sign of any Turkish patrols so after travelling SE about 4 miles we came back & had breakfast, watered & went to Nuran for another days feed, rations & again came out on outpost. There was steady gunfire nearly all night north of us near Gaza.\n","90":"\n\nDid nothing during the day except graze & water our horses. It is nearly 3 miles to water so it takes a good deal of time making 2 trips per day. Sent out a fatigue party to get a fair supply of wood .

It was too hot to get any sleep.\n\nWednesday 25th\n\nAt daylight B Troop went\n","91":"\n\nout on patrol & made a big circling screen to the South & East. We saw no sign of the enemy but came across some sheep & goats & secured three They made very good eating & a change from the eternal “bully” we have had of late.

We got in contact with the Turks & they fired a few shots. We watered at a good well. The water was very cold. In the afternoon our guns started to fire. Must have been picking up ranges & some of the shrapnel was falling too close to our post, so we got away to a safer place & at 4 oclock left for camp, getting in about 6 oclock. 33 Reinforcements arrived. Included among them was McDermott who was a mate of mine in Liverpool camp & who was discharged when sick in hospital.\n","111":"\n\nWe spent the day in camp The land is drying up now & all the crops are eaten & much of the ground torn up with horses feet. In the afternoon a strong wind from the NE sprang up & made things quite unpleasant. We had a good tea cooked & we could hardly eat it for the dust. All our bread, butter\n\njam etc got covered in it.\n\nOne of our patrols yesterday got an\n","112":"\n\nAustrian who was rather “fed up” of this war.

In the afternoon the wind came up strong from the NE exactly the same as yesterday. The flies are breeding rapidly. In the morning if you get up early enough you can have breakfast with only a few flies. At noon, if you are feeling game enough, you can fight the flies for your lunch. In the evening, if you are sufficiently hungry not to mind ½ a pint of dust to flavour you stew with, you might make a fair meal.\n\nSome of the 7th on patrol got heavily fired on by the Turks & had 2 men killed\n\nThursday 17th\n\nIn the morning the Regiment went through their gas test. It was carried out in the following manner. We marched up in Squadron column & a smoke bomb was thrown in front of us. The explosion was the sign of gas over & each man had to throw down his rifle & hat & get his helmet on if possible before the smoke from the bomb reached us. In the second test\n","113":"\n\nwe had to do the same, except that: 6 seconds after the smoke bomb burst, the “dinkum” gas was turned on, we picked up our rifles & marched through it. Later on we marched through a gas area without our helmets, just enough being turned on so that we would be able to recognise it again. Lastly we marched behind & through a smoke screen. I had one man in my troop gassed sufficiently to send him to hospital & others it affected slightly.\n\nWe had the same wind & dust again in the afternoon. We also saw another of our planes being dragged in. It was brought down yesterday. In air fights yesterday 2 of ours were brought down\n","114":"\n\nD Troop rejoined the Squadron They have been detached over 6 weeks now.

The 6th were attached to the 1st Brigade & we left the wadi at 3 oclock, travelled SE till 6. Watered & fed our horses & on again at 8. The night was warm but night marches are always unpleasant.

Several camels were killed don’t know if any men got hit. Got in a good supply of canteen stuff & divided it amongst the troop. The YMCA now supply the Regts in bulk & the QMs divide it out. It is a good way of keeping up extras to the troops.

We travelled 11 or 12 miles to a place called Marakeb right near the sea shore. It seemed like meeting an old friend getting on the sand again. It was getting so dusty on the hard ground as to make it a relief to get on the sand again. It is a few degrees cooler near the sea. A fresh breeze is always blowing\n","125":"\n\n Had an easy day.

Our bits & stirrup iron got an adverse comment, so I suppose we are in for some hard rubbing in the future. More beer was issued out, 1 bottle per man. Was feeling much fitter today.

Everything was scattered over a about ¼ acre of ground, shirts, sox & all sorts of gear & equipment. Got paid. More men went on leave, only 2 from our Squadron.

The place is absolutely full of them. They have come over from Salonica & they reckon they were glad to get away from there On Saturday there was a big aquatic sports carnival. The finals were all run off. There was a large attendance The Anzacs did particularly well taking nearly all the important events.\n","145":"\n\nHad dinner in town & went to the pictures later.

Later in the afternoon it presents quite a continental picture with all the different costumes There are crowds of Tommies here now They seem a pretty good lot & have just come from Salonica & are having a few weeks spell here. The Lake is full of them in the afternoons. They march down in Battalions,\n\nThe aerodrome is alongside our camp. They get busy very early in the morning & it sounds like 20 chaff cutters going.

Met Joe Nevitt & Leo Johnston up on leave from the Regt & arranged with them for a box at the Kursaal. \n\nHad a sleep in the afternoon & it was badly needed. Didn’t like getting up out of bed, but it seemed like wasting good leave so we got on the move again. The play was all in Italian, so we didn’t understand a word. However we managed to get a little fun, principally through Joe Nevitt who used to laugh always at the wrong place. We also decorated the artistes with flowers much to the amusement of the audience. Did not stay till the finish of the show, but saw Joe off safely on the 11.30 pm train to Alex. On Friday morning I met Alan Soul late of Dorrigo & 2 of his\n","159":"\n\nfriends.

Got in another couple of hours rest before breakfast & after we went out to Chatby les Bains for a swim. The water was very heavy & the surf dangerous, so we didn’t stay long in the water. After our swim we called on Mrs Avgerinos & promised to call again after dinner & take the girls to the races. We got a car & had a nice drive out to the Sporting Clubs grounds & had a great afternoon. We picked several winners\n\nJuly 1917\n\nbut they paid very little & we hardly got our expenses out of it. However we were very satisfied & the girls enjoyed themselves immensely. After dinner Sergeant Long came round & took us to an English friend’s place where we had a quiet evening. I was terribly tired & managed to go to sleep on the sofa so also did Gurney, so we apologised & explained & went to the Hotel to bed. On Monday morning the others went away. I went down to the beach & spent most of the day there with the girls, also the next day right up till the time I had to catch the 3.30 train back to Ismailia. It was hard breaking away.

The weather has got a good deal cooler & several mornings have been very foggy. The afternoons have been dusty. Football has been continued with vigour Several squadron matches & 2 inter regimental matches, both of which were draws. We had the pleasure of seeing a German aeroplane brought in. It was brought down by one of ours over the Wadi & the pilot was captured behind the lines. Our air service has improved considerably. There are some splendid aeroplanes here now & they ought to shake Jacko up a bit.\n","217":"\n\nThe aerodrome is alongside our camp. Their sergeants are often over here & they took some of us over, showed us everything & gave us a good feed. The workshops were most interesting & it is an eye opener to see how complete they are, seeing that their camps are only temporary. We had a field day on Friday & were out nearly all day practicing a dismounted attack. We got a fair bit of mail during the week. Received 3 letters from home & also several papers. Replied to some.\n","218":"\n\nThere was a good bit of artillery fire during the night. There were several football matches in the regiment played. Everyone has got football fever. A big consignment of beer arrived for the Brigade. They are issuing it out at 2 bottles per man per day. The quality is not too good. In the afternoon several enemy planes came over our lines & were heavily shelled & later attacked by some of ours. The enemy formation was broken up & they made off in all directions. One was engaged by\n","219":"\n\none of our Bristol fighters & we saw a good air fight lasting nearly 5 minutes. They were right over our lines about 10 or 12000 ft up & it was a great sight to see them circling round diving & side slipping to get an opening. Our machine was too quick for the Taube. The pilot was nearly shot to pieces & his machine did a sudden nose dive our plane broke off & he came spinning down in flames & hit the ground about 2 miles from our camp. The pilot was unrecognisable & was picked up 30 yds from his machine. This is the 2nd one we have seen come down in one week. Now our fellows have got some good machines here they are beginning to give the Huns a warm time when they come over.\n\nThere is a lot of talk about a move from here in a few days & indications point to a strenuous time ahead.

Am beginning to find my way about Alex. It is a big place & some parts of it are terribly crowded. On Thursday Ive got the first list of casualties from the fighting round Beersheba & at night we got word that the place had been taken with 1600 prisoners. The Light Horse took a big part in the attack. Casualties were fairly light many of the regiments not having a single casualty.\n\nSaturday 3rd \n\nHad to remain in the \n","231":"\n\noffice on Saturday afternoon in case further lists came through.

Good news of the advance has been coming in continuously & I believe right through our losses have been small. We are making preparations to remove from here to Cairo & everyone is very sorry especially the chaps who have made a wide circle of friends. They don’t like leaving them. Cairo will be very strange for most. Have been out several times. Last Sunday Long & I had quite a round of visits & had quite an enjoyable time. Was up at the hospital a couple of times to see Sister Barrow. Last Friday I got some cards & sent them to all my friends. Mail was going to\n","235":"\n\nAust same day so they ought to reach there well before Xmas.\n","236":" to","237":"\n\nHave been rushing around saying our adieus & packing up ready for our move to Cairo. It is wonderful the amount of property different chaps have collected & are now discarding as they wont be able to remove it. The Tommies round about have been getting quite a haul. On Wednesday we did hard work as we had to load all our Records & truck them at the Station. We parade before the General in the morning & he gave us a speech. Said he was sorry to lose us etc. We left by the 11.30 train on Wednesday night. Quite a number of civilians were on the Station to see us off. Some of the chaps had made large numbers of friends including all nationalities. It was raining when we left. We had a horrible trip up to Cairo, but got there at 6 am on Thursday morning. We went to a AIF Headquarters Mess for breakfast & were busy\n\nall day unloading lorries & getting cases up stairs. There is more room here than in Alexandria & the mess & quarters are much more comfortable. The hours of toil have been altered from 8.30 to 1, & from 5 to 7.30. with the afternoons free for sport.\n\nWork has increased a great deal Casualties have been coming in freely & we have also had to prepare copies of nominal rolls so have had to work extra hours for fortnight or more. I have visited several of my friends. Called on Mrs Warner & Mrs Rice & have also been out to Briggs several times. The first 2 or 3 Sundays we had off, but now we have to work on Sunday mornings, which none of us like a bit.

I have been enjoying myself a good deal, often go to the Kursaal & concerts & sometimes to picture shows.\n","241":" –","242":"\n\nWe had a good dinner at our mess on Christmas day. Everything was there one could wish for. I had to meet Dick Busby & George Berry, as they are coming with me to the Briggs on Xmas afternoon, so will have a second xmas dinner there.\n\nMrs Briggs prepared a good dinner & we had some music afterwards & enjoyed ourselves immensely. We took presents out for the 3 little girls. Olive Dorothy \n\n& Eva & they were very pleased with them.\n\n \n","243":"\n\nHalf of the staff got 5 days holiday over Xmas & the other half took 5 days over the New Year. I took mine to cover the New Year & left on the night of the 29th for Luxor & Assouan. 5 of us went together. We had a fairly good trip up in the train. It is 13 hours journey to Luxor & we got there for breakfast next morning & caught a train about ten oclock for Assouan which place we reached late in the afternoon. We engaged a guide named Ibrahim Ayrjad. They are very plausible fellows & are out to get all they can from you. Still it is not much good doing the trip with the aid of books alone. The guides know their work & they know their usefulness too. We stayed at the Grand Hotel at Assouan. It is a nice place & is the best one open up there. The bigger places are closed as there have been no tourists to speak of since the war, except local people & soldiers. We got a felucca\n\nand went out on the Nile round Elephantine Island to Kitcheners Island, which is a very pretty place, being one big garden. We got back to the hotel for dinner & afterwards went round the Bazaars. I did not buy anything as it would be too much trouble carrying the things around. Next morning we took donkeys & went to Shellal crossed the River & visited the Temple of Philae. We got a good chance to see it as the dam is open & the Island the temple is on is dry. Often it is under water, so very little of it can be seen. It is over 3000 years old & it is wonderful how preserved the place is. A lot of the relief work has been damaged by the Early Christians & Roman s but still enough remains to recognise the figures All the history of the time & of different Kings are carved on the walls on the temples. Victories were commemorated in this way\n\nAfter visiting Philae, we took the felucca again & sailed to the Assouan dam which we inspected. It is a fine piece of work & is about 1½ miles long. The wall is not very high but very strong & thick. It backs the water up for a huge distance behind, so that is why it hasn’t to be so high as Burren Juck. I had a letter of introduction to Mr Walker one of the engineers here, so we were all asked down to his house where we had refreshments. The staff have a little township of their own with nice gardens & cottages. It must be very lonely for them there, I should imagine. In summer it is exceedingly hot & each year the staff get 3 months leave to England. Mr & Mrs Walker wanted us to stay for lunch but we didn’t have sufficient time. We mounted our donkeys again & started for the quarries where most of the obelisks, statues etc were cut. It is a wonderful how they got\n\nJanuary 1918\n\nthe blocks hundreds of miles down the river & set up in different temples, when you consider that some of the granite columns weighed hundreds of tons. After lunch at the Hotel we got the felucca again, stocked it with provisions & started down the River. Everything was comfortably arranged. Played bridge till dark & then turned in. We reached Kom-ombo at about 11 oclock that night. It was bright moonlight so we inspected the big temple by moonlight. We had a good sleep on the felucca. The guide & the natives cooked us a good breakfast. There was a good wind on the River so we made good sailing to Edfu where we went ashore & walked about a mile to the temple of Edfu. This temple is the best preserved of all the ancient temples in Egypt. As in the others, a good deal of the carvings in the stone & relief work has been defaced, but the walls\n\nJanuary 1918\n\n& the court still stand as strong as ever. After lunch which we had on the felucca we crossed the river & left the boat & caught the train for Luxor about 2 oclock getting to Luxor at about 4.30 We went to the Luxor Hotel. It is a nice hotel with pretty gardens. We just loitered around the rest of the afternoon, playing billiards & talking to the visitors etc. There were a few nice people staying there & they were very friendly. We had some music in the drawing room. It was New Years Eve. We had a splendid dinner that night & remained up to see the New Year in. I was terribly tired when I went to bed that night & didn’t arise till 9 oclock next morning. We only did the Luxor temple next morning as we were all feeling a bit worn out, but after lunch, we went to see the huge temple of Karnak This is the biggest temple in Egypt but most of it is in ruins as the \n\nJanuary 1918\n\nresult of an earthquake a long time ago. A part of it has been rebuilt & more of it will be after the war. There are some enormous obelisks & columns at Karnak, the biggest I have seen Next morning we crossed the River, took donkeys & rode for several miles into the hills to see the \nTemples\n Tombs of the Kings. There are 26 tombs excavated & work is still going on. Some wonderful discoveries have been made in these tombs & they are all in an excellent state of preservation. Some of them being 4000 years old. Some of the mummies are still there. The tombs are lit up by electricity. You pay £1 to get the electric light turned on. After visiting the tombs we went to the temple of Thebes & afterwards visited 2 more temples in the vicinity. It was late in the afternoon when we got back to the hotel. We had a bath as the trip had been dusty & the\n\nJanuary 1918\n\nday fairly warm. We had to catch the train back to Cairo shortly after 7, so we got a basket packed at the hotel. We had a fairly comfortable trip back in the train getting to Cairo at 7.30 next morning, resuming work at 8.30. I was well satisfied with the trip, as I have now seen the principal sights of Egypt at a cost of not much more than £10. In pre war days it would have cost hundreds to come here & see the same things. I sent some souvenirs of the trip home & have also got a collection of photos we took of the different sights, which I must have made up into an album & despatched.\n\nWork at the office has lightened considerably. No more casualties are coming in so we are getting the work cleared up. Mails from Australia have of late been arriving regularly.\n","244":"\n\nHave had a couple of games of football here & find the game very strenuous for one who has got so soft here. Have been to a couple of dances at the British Recreation Club & enjoyed myself immensely. I did not know there were so many girls here & most of them are English too. Had a weekend in Alexandria over the","245":" & while there called in at Records GHQ to find out how cousin Willie was as I had received no reply to my letter.

The orchestra give a concert & the music is splendid. It is right on the sea shore & is quite charming. Must be glorious in the summer time. The worst part of the trip to Alexandria is the coming back on the midnight horror. It takes about 7 or 8 hours to do the 120 miles & there are generally a fair number of passengers, only officers are allowed to travel first class so it is impossible to get a comfortable seat.\n\nOn the","248":" I went to the Races at Heliopolis. Had a good afternoons sport & managed to pay my expenses with a few piastres to the good. On Sunday I went out to dinner to Mrs Briggs. We had a great feed, with Yorkshire pudding first I have had since I left home.\n","249":"\n\non Tuesday Captain Todd turned up & I went round to the National Hotel & had dinner with him and a Lieut Philip from the same Battalion. We had champagne & quite a dinner. After dinner they got a box at the Kursaal & we heard the “Scamps” in the “girl on the Train”, enjoyed the show. Captain Todd & Philip I saw a great deal of when in town. We had a motor ride to Helouan one afternoon & afternoon tea at San Giovanni Went out to Briggs one \naft\n evening Todd charmed them all with his playing & singing. On Saturday afternoon the 3 of us went to the Races. I did no good but the other 2 won. Met a French lady friend Madame Bannarow on the lawn. Another French woman was with her. They made us take afternoon tea with them. She was taken with Todd’s Croix de Guerre, & wanted me to bring him out to see her at her home in Helmich.\n","250":"","251":"\n\nI could not promise, although Todd wanted to go. Madame is a widow with means & rather good looking. I told him I had to look after the interest of my cousin. Next day Sunday we went out to Mena House to have afternoon tea with Mrs Cornish, who is staying there. She has a suite of rooms & Miss Burness & the children are also there. We had a pleasant afternoon. Long & Boyle were there. Long took several photos on the verandah. We stayed till after 7. motored back to down at all had dinner at the National Hotel. After dinner we went into the drawing Room. Todd started to play & soon had quite an audience including several civilians a few young girls I noticed there too. When Todd got the dance music going they started dancing & we kept it up for about an hour. About 10.30 some Australian officers came in including the AIF official artist\n\nLieut Lambert who is a good singer, so he & Todd kept it up between them till midnight. They had the Scamps, the English Theatrical Company, now on at the Kursaal among their audience towards the finish.\n\nOn Monday night Todd went to Alexandria & young Cave & myself went to the Kursaal with Lieut Philip to see the “Gay Parisienne”. Philip shouted us a box. Neither Cave nor I were financial enough to have gone otherwise. We also had a trip to the Mousky Bazaar one afternoon. Todd & Philip both bought a quantity of stuff, including a nice coffee service for cousin Mattie. I contented myself with 4 ash trays, 2 of which I sent to Roy & 2 to Doug.\n","252":"\n\nSaturday 2nd February\n\nWent to the Races at Heliopolis in the afternoon. Managed to win a bit.

There was a terrible crowd in Cairo. Sunday night is the night most people seem to go to the pictures & other places of amusement. It was hard making headway through the crowd when we left the tram.\n\nMonday 4th\n\nWas quiet busy all the morning. The warm weather makes one lazy & inclined to sleep. It is quite a custom here to sleep after lunch. All the shops close till 3 & 3.30. We dont start work till 5 pm, so manage to get in a decent sleep if we want to. During the hot weather people shutter up their houses during the day\n","276":"\n\nit keeps them much cooler.\n\nTuesday 5th\n\nOrderly Sergeant for the day. Was on duty all day till 10 pm at night. Went up to the Bank to see if any money had arrived in the morning. It seems as though no money is arriving now for soldiers in Egypt, but cannot find out why it was stopped. It makes things rather awkward as I want to pay for some things I sent to Kate. Its impossible to save money in Cairo at £2.10\/- per fortnight. Wish some of the heads who stopped the cables would come over here & give it a try. Got through a good bit of work in the afternoon & at night wrote letters to Doug & Edna Ferguson, which I posted. Believe there is a mail going out in a day or two.\n","277":"\n\nPut the usual day. Met Bill Williamson & Joe Nevitt in the afternoon. Both are at the School of Instruction. Went to a whist drive at the Australian Soldiers Club in the evening. Quite a number of English people go there. Must have been fully 20 ladies there.\n","278":" games were played. I didn’t do much good only scoring 100. We finished up a little after 10.30. Supper was provided. The tariff was only 5 piastres. They are going to hold something similar every Wednesday night, either a whist drive or a social. A library has been opened at our mess. They have over 200 books already, it should soon increase.\n\nThursday 7th\n\nThe day was very cloudy close & depressing. Felt no good all day. Played billiards at the British Recreation Club in the afternoon. Went up to the Bank but there was no felouse. Remained in after dinner & went to bed early. We are getting crook bread issued to us, it is very dark in colour heavy & full of grit. Most of us are buying our own bread. The doctor has condemned the issue bread, but we get nothing in lieu of it. The A.S.C. still collect our 1\/9 per day. The Egyptian jam they issue no one will eat & it is all sent back. We wouldn’t mind if they would allow us to buy our own\n","279":"\n\n& give the mess committee the money. I think we could do much better.\n\nFriday 8th\n\nWas fairly busy all the morning getting out orders etc. In the afternoon got a decent book & had a read. The weather is very close & hot.\n","280":"\n\nWent to the Races at Heliopolis in the afternoon. I picked the winners of the first 2 races & did fairly well up to the last race. Had a good afternoons sport. It wasn’t a backers day as very few of the favourites did any good at all. Saw Bob Thorne at the Races & he came into town with me, He is at the cavalry school. Saw Frank Grant of Bellingen after dinner in the street & had a yarn to him. He is also at the School of Instruction.\n","281":"\n\nHalf the staff got the morning off & many of them went to Alexandria. I elected to work & will have next Sunday off. An English mail was in this morning, but got nothing out of it. Am expecting a parcel. Ella\n","282":"\n\nSutherland is sending me. Won a sweep on the Races last Saturday but it was only worth 10\/-. There was some excitement in Cairo this morning. The Jewish Battalion which has just arrived here from London paraded through Cairo & were entertained. There was big turn out of people. It didn’t take us long to pick out what they were when we saw them close. At first we thought they were ordinary Tommies. They are not a very good looking lot & are all shapes & sizes from 4ft 6 ins up. I wasn’t very much impressed with their appearance.\n\nMet Williamson & Lyall, 2 cadets from the school & they had lunch at the mess with me. We all went out together to the 27th General Hosp. It is a British Hospital but there are a few Australian sisters there & they entertained us to afternoon tea. Williamson is in the 5th LH & Lyall belongs to cousin Will’s Battalion the 7th Scottish Rifles. It was he that gave me the particulars of his death. The day was very\n\nMarch 1918\n\nsultry & cloudy & at night it came on to rain & rained fairly steady all night, an unusual thing here. The town is very flat & rain is not too good for it. All the water has to be swept into the sewers. There are some boats in from Australia & we expect some letters in a day or two.\n\nMonday 11th\n\nUsual days work. Had a quiet read in the afternoon. Sent some photos out to Todd & Phillip, the group we had taken with Mrs Cornish at Mena House. The “Scamps” opened again this time at the Opera House. They stages “A Chinese Honey moon”. The Theatre is beautiful, all the seats are of Red plush & the boxes are very much larger than the ordinary. The stage is very large. The dressing & the costumes were very good, but several things combined to spoil the play, & I was pretty tired of it when it was over.\n","283":"\n\nThe weather has turned real fine again. Got paid today. Was absolutely without ½ a piastre. A boat arrived from Australia Colonel Fuller of the 6th LH was on\n","284":"\n\nboard.\n\nWednesay 13th\n\nThere is a fair bit of work coming in especially on Wednesdays & Thursdays. An Australian mail was delivered today. Got 1 letter from home, one from Doles & 1 from Edna Ferguson. I believe there is another boat arriving in a few days time. There was a social at the Australian Soldiers Club. Quiet a number of nurses were there & we had a nice little evening finishing up at about a quarter to 11.\n","285":"\n\nThe day was very warm & windy & dusty in the afternoon. Nearly everybody is putting up blue & red stripes. A soldier leaving for active service in 1914 can wear 1 red & 3 blues. Then there are good conduct stripes turned down on the left sleeve & As on the colour patches on your shoulder for Gallipoli service. I havn’t taken to wearing any of them yet. Some of the chaps will be stripes & colours all over if the war goes on much longer. Put in for a pass for a week end leave to Alexandria.\n","286":"\n\nWas very busy all day Wrote & posted a letter home. Joe Nevitt came in & had dinner with me.\n","287":"\n\nWas going to go to Alexandria for the week end, but as no cash has yet arrived I didnt put in for a pass. \n\nWent to the Races. The Sultan was present & his private band played during the afternoon. The afternoon was windy & there was a shower or two of rain Nevertheless there was a good attendance & a good afternoons sport. Didnt manage to get away with any felouse although I got on to a couple of winners.\n","288":"\n\nHad a good sleep in in the morning as I didnt have to go to the office. Went down to the Tennis Courts at about 10 oclock & afterwards had a game of Billiards. Went out to Mr & Mrs Briggs for dinner & in the afternoon went out for walk round the Koubbeh Palace Gardens. The kiddies also came with us.\n","289":"\n\nStayed for supper & got back to our quarters about ½ past 10.\n\nMonday 18th\n\nHad little to do in the morning so wrote a couple of letters, one to Doles. Saw \n\n our colonel in the afternoon he has just come back from Australia. Remained in during the evening. Had some music in our Recreation Room at the Quarters.\n","290":"\n\nHad a fair bit of work to do, but enjoyed a good sleep in the afternoon. 5 of us got a box at the Opera House, & saw Miss Hook of Holland. It was really very good & quite witty. \n","291":"\n\nUsual day at the office. Went round to the Bank in the afternoon. Still no money. It is over a month since I cabled. Went to see the Mummers, a soldier troop who are giving 1 performance here at the Piccadilly. They are quite worth hearing.\n","292":"\n\nWrote a letter or two as there is not much work coming in now. Went for a walk in the afternoon.\n","293":"\n\nWent round to the Warners after dinner.\n","294":"\n\nWent to the Races at Heliopolis in the afternoon. It was a splendid day & there was a big turn out. Backed 4 seconds & one winner.\n","295":"\n\nFirst news of the German offensive on the west front this morning everyone is expectant. Worked in the morning & remained at home in the afternoon & evening.\n","296":"\n\nUsual routine.\n\nTuesday 26th\n\nGenl Chauvel was to inspect this morning. He was in the office but inspection was postponed till Thursday. Got paid to day. Most of it went buying shirt for the summer. Worked back in the afternoon.\n\nWednesday 27th\n\nEverybody is watching the Western Front & all the cables are eagerly read. A Further advance has been made over the Jordan. Our Regt is up that way now. Went to the Whist Drive at the Australian Soldiers Club at night. Met several Australian nurses there that I knew & had an enjoyable evening.\n","297":"\n\nGeneral Chauvel & Staff inspected right through the office this morning. He seemed to be well satisfied with the way things were carried on here. Got a letter from Captain Todd in the morning.\n\nFriday Good Friday\n\nHad the whole afternoon off. It was very windy. Met Mrs Price & a Miss Williams in the afternoon & arranged to call on Monday \n\nLeft Bayoud for Hassaniya Australian mail arrived English mail arrived\n\nLeft Hassaniya\n\nArrived Mazar\n\nR Welsh Fusiliers Concert Mazar\n\nEnemy bombed El Arish\n\nLeft Mazar arrived Bardawil\n\nLeft Bardawil arrived Masaid\n\n1st Brigade went through here to Bayoud\n\nGenl Chetwode inspected us\n\nAustralian mail distributed\n\nNZ & 2nd Bgde football match\n\nWent to Camel Transport for a month\n\nWent to El Arish with 320 camels\n\nBrigade left Masaid & arrived Sheikh Zowaiid\n\nNZs &2nd Bgde had skirmish with Turks \n\nFixed up camp at Sheikh Zowaiid\n\norderly for the day\n\nMarch 1918\n","298":" \n\nUsual work in the morning.

Went out with\n","299":"\n\nyoung Cave to Briggs for dinner & afternoon tea. We went out then to some French friends of the Briggs. Met 5 or 6 French girls. They were very friendly. We stayed to tea & afterwards had some games. They are much more merrier than any English girls you meet & we were soon on good terms with them. It would take a month to make ½ the progress with an English girl. We enjoyed ourselves immensely & are going to picnic to the Pyramids with them tomorrow afternoon.\n","300":" April\n","301":" \n\nGot 1 letter only in the Australian mail from Doug. Cant understand why some letters have not arrived. 2 mails have been missed now. Usual morning work. Went to the picnic in the afternoon. There were 14 or 15 of us at the Pyramids altogether & we had some good fun & took plenty of grub etc. Felt very tired when I got home.\n","302":"\n\nNo further particulars as to the casualties in the Regt have been received, but Corp Marriott who was to have relieved me here is in hospital.\n\n\t\n","303":"\n\nwith appendicitis, so I dont know what will be done.

It was a beautiful day but I wasnt feeling too good having caught a cold so wasnt able to enjoy my trip a bit. Had a sleep on the lawn till dinner time. After dinner went & picked up my VAD & went out for a drive and afternoon tea. She had to go back to the hospital on duty at 5 oclock so after that I went & had a sleep & caught the 11.30 pm train back to Cairo. It was a rotten trip. Wasn’t feeling like work on the Monday. The Doctor put me\n","307":"\n\noff duty & I didn’t go to work till Thursday. Had a lot of work to do when I got back & it took me a few days to make up the arrears of work. On Saturday several of us went out to Mrs Clark’s at Maadi & had tea I heard her husband is an officer on the intelligence staff & they have a nice garden home at Maadi near where our old camp used to be. On Sunday morning we went to the Symphony Concert at the Kursaal, it was splendid. There was a good orchestra of 50 players & it is quite the best music I have listened to here yet. These concerts are very popular & are much appreciated\n\nApril 1918\n\nOn Sunday afternoon Hornsey & I went out to the Briggs We stayed for afternoon tea & supper.
