Had a great number to see me off. Left on the","10":" at 3PM from McIlwraith Wharf. Miller's Point. Perfectly calm The trip down the Harbour was very solemn, as the dull low clouds, the steamer silently flying through the waters & the surroundings seemed very quiet & dull. Made down coast at 15 knots per hour. Given bunks in S5 Ward: Reveille at 7AM Breakfast at 8AM. Have\n\nPorridge, Bacon & Steak, potatoes & Bread & Butter. For dinner we have Soup, Mutton & vegetables & Rice puddings. Had no work to do on the Thursday. On Friday scrubbed 2 flights of stairs leading to the Wards. Took about 30 minutes to do. The sea was very clam. The coast looked to be very barren. Wrote several letters & had a game of Quoits. Turned in early, Reached Melbourne at 10 AM. ","11":"\n 1916. Given leave till Sunday night as the ship was to be fumigated. Had good look around the City & on Saturday afternoon went to see Mrs Milne. Found her place without much difficulty & had tea. Met Letty Smith - but had to go early as had\n\narranged to go to a theatre \"Night of Nights.\" It was not much good. The W.O. came too. Stayed the night at the Federal Coffee Palace Hotel. Went out to\n","12":"\n\nMalvern with one of the chaps to a friend of his. Had a pleasant afternoon & then went to Mrs Milne's place for tea. After tea, they took me to St. Kilda Beach the Manly of Melbourne. It has a large pier extending out in the water for a great distance. Caught a train to Port Melbourne.\n","13":"\n\nLeave from 10AM till 11 PM. Went to the Musuem & Art Gallery in the morning. Had dinner at the Museum. The\n\nshows of both are much the same as Sydney. Although Sydney has a larger assortment. In the afternoon went to the Pictures & had tea at the C of England Recreation Room. Wrote a couple of letters & returned to the ship.\n","14":"\n\nDetailed with 9 others to go on duty for the day. Did 2 hours watch over the stores, as the painters are on the ship. The ship is getting a good paint. After tea with the others went over to the Transport \"Botanist\" being on opposite side of the wharf to see the Indians eat. They are very dirty & hardy. The Engineer then took us down to the engine rooms. The engines\n\nare magnificent. 30 feet High of most intricate mechanical inventions all there to drive a shaft of 18 inches thickness which turns the propellorround 75 times per minute, thus sending the ship flying through the water at a speed of 12 knots.\n","15":"\n\nLeave till 11 oclock PM. Went to town & had a look around the city. Came home early as tired of town. Orontes sailed from along side at 3 PM with 600 troops on Board. Had tea & received welcomed letters from N.S.W. Went to Bed.\n","16":"\n\nLeft the ship at 2:30 PM & called on Mrs Milne who\n\ntook me around the Botanical Gardens. They are very fine. The Governor's House is also a fine Bulding. The gardens overlook the Yarra River which runs through the City. Had a look at the Zoo which is also very good.\n","17":"\n\nWorked fairly hard as the ship had to be prepared for the 14 A.G.H. which are coming with us. Finished at 9 PM & given leave till midnight. Went into town & had a look around, the last look at Melbourne for some time. Altogether Melbourne is a good city, has wide streets & several large buildings. The tram service is good\n\n& so is the Railway. The winter seems to be very bleak as compared with Sydney. It lacks pleasure resorts.\n","18":"\n\n14 A.G.H. men came on Board at 7 AM & given their quarters. A Band rendered some good music for a while. At 3.30 PM the people were allowed on the wharf. A great crowd. The Boat drew out at 4 PM & we arrived at the Heads at 8 PM. The \"Rip\" (the meeting of two waters) was fairly rough. Made West at 13 knots.\n","19":"\n\nVery windy & fresh. Most of men sick. Did some work down in No 2 Hold & came up very white & wished for\n\nland. Was a little sick, so sat up on the Promenade Deck. Went to church 10.30 AM. Then remained on Deck. Had no Dinner, but forced tea down & felt a little better. It seems funny to have to turn your watch back. Yesterday we put it back 40 minutes & today 26 minutes. Went to bed early.\n","20":"\n\nVery Rough sea. In the Great Australian Bight. Wind blowing very hard. Had to work in No 1 Hold right forward in the ships Bows. Made me feel not myself so came up & sat on Deck. Have to do guard from 5 PM till 5 PM tomorrow. 2 hours on & 6 hours off.\n","21":"\n\nOn Guard till 5 PM. Exceptionally rough seas.\n","22":"\n\nDid a little fatigue work. This work is to \nkept\n keep the ship clean. Such as cleaning the wards. After this work we are free for the day. Generally turn in at 9 PM.\n","23":"\n\nSame Routine as Yesterday. \non \nFriday 26th August\n we sighted the long looked for land. It appeared to be very sandy & foliage was not thick as on the coasts of Q.land & N.S.W. Passed Cape Leeuwin at 8 PM. All we could see was a light House which revolves every 10 seconds.\n\nSaturday 26th\n","24":"\n\nPassed Rottnest Island about\n\n8 AM. This Island is a very long & narrow Island & has been used as a German Concentration Camp. The prisoners were recently removed to Sydney. Arrived at Fremantle about 11 AM. The harbour is formed by two large Breakwaters, & light House on each one. The width of the entrance is no more than 240 Yards & shipping goes up for a mile or so. There are about 3 good wharves, but we anchored in the stream. The A.U.S.N.Co.'s liner 'Indarra' was in: Given leave from noon till midnight. Had a look at Fremantle. A very small place. Has nice Railway Station & Electric Cars somewhat prehistoric. Trained to Perth a distance of 10 miles\n\nThe railway gauge is 3'.6\" the same as Queensland. It is a slow gauge. Took 40 minutes to Perth which has a very nice Railway station. The majority of the streets are very narrow. The Post Office is not a bad building. The A.M.P. Building & Viking Chambers are good buildings. The gardens are small but good. The business centre street, (St Georges Terrace) is a\nn\nstreet which could stand its own with St Kilda Road Melbourne. The people are extremely nice & come up & speak to you. Quite different to Sydney & Melbourne. There is no style, & the people dress very plain. It is about the size of Bathurst. The Govt considers soldiers, as they refuse to take\n\nany fares. The chief amusement is Picture\ns\nshow. There are no 'plays'. Like Sydney there are surfing beaches. Collaroy Beach is one of the main beaches. Parliament House is a nice building. The police dress as in Sydney & look much smarter than in Melbourne. Came home to the boat at 11.30 PM. Had first opportunity of seeing her illuminated.\n","25":"\n\nDid usual work & came up on deck so as not to miss anything that may chance to happen. Had two Coal Boats loading her upon either side. Made decks very dirty. They left at 12 noon. The S.S.Moira left for the North Coast of Perth. It is a cattle boat of 500 tons\n\nthe \"Indarra\" the largest Interstate boat then left & made pass Rottnest Island. We were next & moved down the stream. Took a last look at Australia for sometime. Passed the lighthouse & the Sergeant gave a tune on cornet, \"Should Auld Aquaintance be forgot\" etc. Passed the \"Moira\" a couple of miles out & saw the last of Indarra as she went over the horizon. Practically calm weather in comparison with Australian Bight.\n","26":"\n\nMaking N.NW at 12 knots. Lovely weather. Had church at 10.30AM. Very nice service. Sat on Deck till dinner & then read all afternoon\n\nWent to church at 7.30 PM. It is getting much hotter.\n","27":"\n\nRoutine as usual. Very warm. Had a concert at night. The sea is calm. Have many storms & the rain comes down in torrents.\n","28":"\n\nWrote letters home to Aust as mail closed 2nd September.\n","29":"\n\nPlenty of fatigue duty. Cleaning Port Holes & a hard job at that. Takes 2 days hard work to get them clean.\n","30":"\n\nBoiler went wrong, so speed of boat was reduced. Two others had to be cooled. Thus we were delayed.\n\n\n","31":"\n\nCool places are now in great demand & you do not feel up to doing much. Have Deck Quoits and cards. The Physical Culture is now looked for by all on board as it keeps you in good condition. The instructor is very strong & gave an exhibition in the night. Tore a packet of cards in halves, & lifted 4 men together.\n","32":"\n\nFinished letters. I wished to be home for a little time as it was mother's birthday yesterday. We had boat drill. I am stationed as Boat No9 Starboard side. The Chief Engineer is in charge. The 14 AGH staff acted as patients in the different wards; some\n\nwere cot cases others able to walk or be carried. On the \"Alarm\" being sounded, all have to get your LifeBelt on, which is situated at the head of each bed & then proceed to your different stations. I am stationed on No 3 Hatchway & to help to take the 4 cot cases off the lift & place them (two on each side) near the boats. Have then to go down & help in the wards. The wards being cleared, the O.C comes around & inspects (would he do it in the real thing). We then have to report at \nthe\nyour respective boat stations. The whole work was carried out in ten minutes.Some of the 14th got rough treatment, as a 15 stone fellow carried\n\nby one of the boys up a narrow ally-way is tough job & we were not too particular if we knocked them up against a post or two. The question after was Would they carry out the Red tape business if we were struck?\n\nSunday\n4\n","33":"\n\nHad church parade & the delivery of chaplain was excellent. He is a decent old chap & jolly. Had a read & sleep. The heat is still at its best. Crossed the line at 2PM & are holding celebrations tomorrow. Owing to the 14thA.G.H. men being vaccinated, Neptune & his wives have been warned not to appear, but instead \"A Nautical Day\" will be held when pillow fights, & Cock fights will be held\n\nin the swimming bath.\n","34":"\n\nHave half holiday. The boat pitching too much empties the swimming bath so the \"Nautical Day\" is postponed. However we had a day on the Boat Deck when general sports were held as, Potato Race, Wheel Barrow Race, Jumping, & Hockey. The Hockey proved to be the most interesting & the \"Glorious","35":" beat the 14thin two matches.There were cries of \"Go on New South\" \"Blues, Blues\" \"Down with the Vics.\" The hospital was in demand after the match as some of the sticks came in contact with the players' shin Bones. However we were beaten\n\nin the Tug of War, & that because we loss the toss. The boat had a slope to stern & the 14thwere quick to notice it. They one 2 to 1 as whoever pulled from aft won. In all we had a pleassnt afternoon. The prizes were given out at night when the \"Karoola\" Orchestra rendered some painfull music.\n\nTuesday 5thSeptember\n\nCame insight of glorious land after being at sea for 10 days. At first the coast of Ceylon was hardly discernable owing to the mist. The coast is very undulated & range after range of Hills\ngo\narise up from the shore. The foliage is dense & large cocoanut\ns\nplantations are seen\n\nfrom the ship. These came down to the shore. We arrived at Colombo about 6 PM. The light House is in the centre of the town. The Port is protected by a large breakwater which sends huge sprays of water up. During the South East Monsoons the Breakwater is obscured. The Pilot station is a nice building situated at the entrance. The Port is not deep enough to enable shipping to come up, so all vessel keep out in the stream. The Pilot came on Board & here we had the first opportunity of seeing the niggers. They greeted us with; by asking us for pennies. They talk very quickly & it is almost a gabble. We anchored\n\njust off the Breakwater, about 10 minutes row from the shore. We were given leave from 8 PM till midnight after the Medical Doctor passed the ship. Plenty of rowing boats were at hand, pulled by niggers (Mostly Singalese.) Having heard a lot of this race so we knew how to treat them. They wanted 1\/- each but they got 6d. As soon as we arrived on shore the niggers were asking you to \nby\nbuy & practically pulled you into their shop. A necklace he showed, of Moon Stones; price 12\/6 he got","36":" It is the custom there to charge five times as much. They are very honest anyhow.\n\nIt is an art to beat them down & may take half an hour or so. The best way is to name a price & if you cant get it, pretend to go away & they will follow you up the street asking you to come back. So you end, with having three or four niggers trying to sell you different articles at the same time. (I came first master. I came first sir etc) The Hotels are equally as large as Hotel Australia, but since most of the steamers go via the Cape business is slack. There are very few Europeans in Colombo & there are no women of any sort. Everything is done by the men, & the Singalese are professionl cadgers. This race\n\nrepresents most of the people in Colombo, they are very slim & small & are the working class. The Mahometans wear a comb in their hair & own most of the shops etc. The Buddhists are also the upper class. All races are very clean & their dress custom is a loose jacket & a skirt, with a towel around their heads. We had a ride in a Rickshaw to the barracks to meet some of the other lads. Met two Englishmen & had a talk to them. They had arrived from the North of India prior to sailing for home. One had been to the Dardenelles Campaign. We left there & came back\n\nto the Bristol Hotel & had a Light Luncheon. Coming out we saw ten or more Karoola staff with 3 French Officers so we sat down & talk. Each was trying to understand the other. We shook hands & said \"Bon Jour Monsieur\". They said \"Vive La Australe\" & gave a real hand shake. (Fancy a British Officer doing that to a French private). We sang the French National Song & said Good bye to them. They kissed a couple of the lads. Arrived back to the ship at Midnight. Colombo has well made streets butnarrow. There is no heavy traffic on them. Motor Cars & Ricksaws are the most\n\ncommon conveyances. Avenues of trees are in nearly every street, which makes the streets very picturesque. The buildings are small except the Hotels. The main hotels are the \"Galle Face\", \"Grand Oriental\" & the \"Bristol\". These are used by tourists. The rain comes on very quickly & is very heavy while it lasts.\nEl\nEnglish money is current there & 6dexchange is charged on notes. For gold you can get 22\/-. When the natives see the money in your hand their eyes just hang out of their sockets.\n\nWednesday 6th\nAugus\nSeptember\n\nCleaned up the ship in Double quick time & given leave\n\nfrom 8.30 AM. I went with a party of 5 others, firstly to do shopping & then to go to Mount Lavinia. We went along the street & had a look at the shops. What a gabble, niggers on either side trying to sell articles to you. They cling like the ivory too & follow you for some distance. Then a lot of youngsters will follow & cry out, \"Me Mudder poor, me fadder die me starving, you rich master, oh master me poor one penny master\".\n\nWe made our way to a place recommended by one of the old chaps who came with us. Here, we stayed for 3 hours & had a look at nearly every article. Each of us spent a\n\ngood sum. Bronze is cheap there, also silk. Had some refreshments supplied by the owner. Then went in a Ricksaw to the \"Galle Face Hotel\" which overlooks the sea. This hotel is the largest of its kind there. Went through a very pretty district. Everywhere is so green & clean. The native villages are interesting. The streets are about 10 feet across & then it is full of youngsters. These races like their home very much. The huts appeared to be fairly clean, but I was glad to get out of the place. We then went to Fort Station & took train to Mount Lavinia. The railway gauge is similar to Melbourne, very wide, but\n\nbut the train here in Colombo are very slow. We passed through lovely country & there were many large houses & villages enroute. Most of the natives could speak English enough to make themselves understood. The train ran along parallel with the shore, the spray coming in the window. Large cocoanuts plantations exist right to the very waters edge. These trees grow to a great height about 30 feet then the folige & Branches come out. The fruit is covered with a green coating which when ripe dries & becomes fibre. The fruit falls too. On the trunk of these trees are, dried leaves tied around them, so that the natives can hear if anyone\n\ntries to climb & steal the fruit. We arrived at Lavinia & had an eight course meal. It seemed strange to have niggers waiting on you; & they do wait on you, with the hope of a bigger tip. Having finished the dinner we took a few snaps.One, of a number of Catar-marangs lying on the beach. These boats are used by fishing class, who sail out for miles. The boat is 9 inched wide & about 12 feet long. Three men generally go out in one. The boat is non capsizable as the shape of the boat is like this . At the bottom, a trunk of a tree is attached which makes it safe\n\nto travel in. We then went over to see how lace was made. A Pattern is put down in a block & the cotton is in a number of threads,to each is attached a block. Then the maker crosses the cotton in accordance to the pattern. It is rather a tedious way of making an article. We then watched a boy climb up a tree for a cocoanut, which we tried.The milk is not too bad & the other was good. The milk was colourless.The next to see was a Buddhist Temple. This temple was very funny. On the walls were pictures of men which represented the coming of Mahomet. There were several\n\ndifferent series & after the guide had gabbled off a lot he said \"This is my religion\". We then went into\nthe\nanother chamber where the image of the Buddhist was. This huge ghastly thing was made of some native clay. It had one hand out, so we asked the guide what that was for. He was annoyed. We soon knew for when we came near the priest we had to shell out. Some did not & there was a great noise, but we were the strongest party. Left the guide & made for the station. As I had to go on guard at five oclock, I only had 20 minutes from the Fort Station to the boat. A\n\nblock occurred a few hundred yards out of the station, so I jumped out of the\nstation\ntrain & into a Rickshaw which took me to the wharf. Gave the man 6dfor fare (which should have been 4d) but he wanted 1\/-. pushed him out of the way & jumped into a boat arriving at 4.55 PM. & tired at that. Mounted guard for 12 hours.I was on the Gangway & did good in regard to fruit. I made a good meal of Bananas & Paw Paws. Most of the chaps came home pretty steady. some needed assistance. So thus ended one of the most interesting days of my life.\n","37":"September\n\nCleaned the ship out for sailing, having taken on coal & water. The niggers are hard workers & can coal much quicker than Europeans. Of course there are twice as many of them.They seem to exist on practically nothing having a little rice in a day. Some only sit on their feet for if they do not, the evil spirit will take the good out of them all the quicker. Some of them are good divers but will only go in for silver which they get before it goes too far down. The O.C. came aboard at 12 noon & we set sail on a 11 days\n\ntrip to Suez at 12.30 PM, leaving a very interesting place in the Background. We took on 4 English patients for Suez. One is dying. They have been to Mesopotamia. The P&O Vessel \"Nooltan\" came in & was leaving a day after us, so we are wondering if she would beat us to Suez. She has 500 troops on Board.\n","38":" Septermber\n\nWeather very cool. Had very easy day. Going in a West Nor Westerly direction. Read most of the day.\n","39":"\n\nDid fatigues in morning & had a very interesting lecture in the afternoon.\n\nWe have a lecture every day at 3PM. The lectures are made interesting by having under the magnifying glass the different Bacteria of Fever, Consumption etc etc. A grand concert took place at night when a good programme was rendered by the Staff of the Hospital .S. Unit.\n","40":"\n\nHad a church parade at 10.15AM. The sea is fairly rough, which breaks the monotony, it also makes the ship cooler. It is remarkably cool for this part of the world. Went to church at night to have a Sing Song.\n\nSlept on deck & took the risk of getting a sea over us.\n","41":"\n\nDid the usual fatigues & had Physical Drill, the weather has been exceedingly cool owing to a good wind & rough sea. A Masquerade Ball was held tonight & a very good turn out at that. It was a surprise to see so many costumes on a ship. No less than 100 characters were there. Prizes were given for the 1 Best Girl 2 Most natural dress 3 Most laughable. Dancing was funny as the ship had a roll on, & all went sliding to one end. The Ball ended at 10,30PM an\n\nextension of time having been granted.\n","42":"\n\nDid a very slow run today, having a stiff wind & head sea, also bad coal. The general run is 320 miles. Had a debate tonight titled \"Are Australians too fond of Sports\" Good arguments were given on both sides. The affirmative party \none\nwon.\n","43":"\n\nPassed Socotra Island at 8AM. This island is about 80 miles long & is very mountainous & barren. Inhabited by cannibals & we all hoped that we\n\nwould not have to use our life belts here as none felt incline to be made a meal of. It took 4 hours to pass the mainland. & soon afterwards we entered in the Gulf of Aden & ran into calm sea. The 14th A.G.H gave a concert which was not much.\n","44":"\n\nThe heat has last arrived & has come down with all force, perhaps it is because we are between two great continents. Had Boat Drill again, & every thing went satisfactory. All were on Deck & at their respective boatstations within 5 minutes. These drills &\n\na map of the Mediterranean Sea being put up, seems favourably to us going through to France. Had a Mock Trial tonight & it was excellent. The case was A certain John Gray sued the editor of the \"Karoola Journal\" for making false statements in connection with his moustache, thereby bringing him under severe ridicule from the remainder of the staff. & when he gave a command someone called out \"Half a mow\". After the claimant had put forth his case & the witnesses the defendant gave his. The Judge or rather as he would correct them \"His Honor\"\n\ntold the jury to give the verdict to the claimant, as a nice young girl was to meet him if he won. However they gave the verdict to the Defendant.\n\nFriday 15th September\n\nEntered the Red Sea at 8AM passing the island of Perim at 9AM. The sea was like a sheet of glass & the heat terrific. Remained in sight of land ever since Passed the \"Two Brothers\" Islands in the sea & much alike. They are solid rock & are very precipitous. The 'Karoola' on the return trip last time owing to the steering gear breaking was almost wrecked here . Getting a close as 100 yds\n\noff the rocks. The Officer onBridge put her astern only in the nick of time. The coast of Africa is exceedingly barren no growth whatsoever is to be seen. The soil is \nvery\n clay & sand. Fish like Trout are plentiful & fly out of the water. Sharks too are numerous. The sunsets in this sea are beautiful. The skyseems to go a deep orange colour. The 'Karoola' Journal was read out tonight & it took some of the chaps who like themselves down.\n\nSaturday 16th September\n\nHave again lost sight of land. Cool for this part of the globe. Although your shirt is wringing wet at 10AM\n\nThe crew had boat drill to day. In further if the siren hoots 5 successive blasts all on Board have to rush for belts & get patients out of the Ward. The Hospital Ship Unit gave a Farewell Concert to the 14th A.G.H. This perhaps was the best concert we had had since our voyage commenced. The 14th AGH leave us on the 20th instant probably. Speeches were given by the both Colonels of the Units.\n\nSunday 17th September\n\nI wish that I could fly home for the day but being without wings & the distance too much I must stay where I am. The day broke\n\nas usual with a clear sky, rain is practically unknown here. Passed the Twelve Apostles, rocks which are in the Red Sea. Did our fatigues & then had church. The Chaplain is a jolly chap & is very popular amongst the men. Had a fine service, a farewell to the 14th AGH.\n\nMonday 18th September\n\nDid usual Fatigues in the morning. Passed many vessels, mostly cargo boats. Given a half holiday to paly a Cricket match 1st A.H.S. via 14th A.G.H. The 14th went in and got 45 runs. We went in & got 206 with 4 men retiring\n\nSent them in & they scored 53 so we beat them by an innings & a number of runs. Passed Mount Sinai where the Ten Commandments were given out to the people. The sunsets are beautiful & past imagination. The Coast line is very undulated with sharp edges standing out very pronounced againsta sky of beautiful red, changeing colour gradually till at last a veil of mist envelopes the coast.\n\nTuesday 19th September\n\nHave to go on guard from 8AM till 8AM tomorrow. Insight of Suez. The coast is sandy & very precipitous\n\nArrived at 8AM & anchored in the stream. A good deal of shipping here. Went into Port Teufik & and came alongside the Indian Hospital Ship \"Neuralia\" plying between Suez & India. She is a fine vessel. The Egyptians are a filthy race & the towns are no cleaner. The men were not allowed off but went for a route march around the Port. The impression of this place is mentioned above. They had a swim which was very acceptable. The natives gave an exhibition of diving. The Indian. H. Ship left at 2PM. The 14th AGH luggage& personnel was put ashore. Was up all night doing guard\n\nWednesday 20th September\n\nThe train for the 14th AGH arrived at 9AM & they left for Cairo at 10 AM. The usual send off was given. The ship seemed deserted with out them, for they use to run all over it. Pulled out into the stream remaining there for 3 hours when we weighed anchor & at 2.30 PM entered the much discussed Suez Canal. How the chaps smiled for at last we were going through, bound for Port Said & Alexandria to pick up No 3 A.G.H. for ?. France or England. The Suez Canal is about 80 miles long having severallakes in it. The average width is 100 yards The maximum speed of vessels is 4 knots per hour. Even\n\nthis speed causes a good wash. From the canal Suez looks very pretty yet on a closer view the building are not finished & altogether it is a wretched place. Large Camps are on the banks of the Canal & the fortifications are entensive. There are British Australians & Indians consisting of Infantry Light Horse & Engineers. A few Camel corps are to be seen. The dugouts & trenches are perfect, also the barbed wire entanglements. We also saw a number of Turk prisoners. Some are used to carry water. The men are well Browned under the intense heat of the sun & the glare of the sand is\n\nterrific. Passed many Pilot or Look out stations whose duty it is to inform the next station ahead that the ship is proceeding up the Canal. All along the Canal are places prepared for heavy guns. Have just passed the 4th Light Horse & echoes of Coo ees sound plainly over the water. The British Tommies also give us a Coo ee. The ship is only about 20 yards from the Banks. The nights are very cold here while the day is quite the contrary. Passed the English monitor \"Humber\" noted on the Belgium Coast some time ago. These vessels are nasty looking & a sailor turned a 12\" inch turret around\n\non us. I for one did not like the look of it & was glad when we passed it. These vessels are low lying & do not draw much water. The shape is somewhat like this\n\nThe deck is 2 feet out of the water. I do not think the speed is great. Passed a mine layer & gun boat. On the right of the Canal is the desert of Tih 120 miles wide. This desert is only crossed by a couple of old caravan routes, one to Palestine & the other to Sinai Peninsula. This Canal has reduced the distance between Western Europe & the East by 4000 miles\n\nThe Canal passes between lakes Menzaleh, Ballah, Timsah & the Great & small Bitter Lakes. The latter we are now in. 80,000,000 cubic yards of sand, earth & rock were excavated from the canal before it was completed. The cost of forming this canal was £20,000,000. The fees are - for Cargo vessels 5\/3dper ton, passenger steamers 6\/- per ton & 8\/4dfor each passenger. At night vessels have a searchlight attached to the Bow which is capable of spreading a light 4000 feet ahead. The signal to proceed up the Canal at night is a Red & Yellow Light. Each steamer takes a couple of Arab's boats, whose\n\nwork is to secure the ship if we have to wait to allow a ship to pass. Ismalia in Lake Timsah is the most important place passed on the journey.It is the central point on the canal & is a thriving town. At present a large Australian Camp is here.The Canal is 35 feet deep & is continually being dredged. Since 1875 the canal has been under the joint control of British & French Governements.\n\nOn either side are avenues of trees.This not only beautifies the canal but keeps the sand from shifting. Stopped in Lakes for 3 hours to let other ships come down. The A.H.S Kanowna passed us at\n\n10PM from England\n\nThursday 21st September\n\nArrived at \nSuez\n Port Said 7.30 AM & anchored near a Battle Ship. ( A Pre-Dreadnought). Took water on but are coaling at Alexandria which will be our next Port.\n\nAt 10AM an enemy aeroplane flew over but was chased by others of ours. A French Hydroplane decended quite near us & was put in a shed. One of the British vessels had two of these \nves\n types of machines on board. The Motor Launch scouts are numerous & have a 2\" gun mounted for'ard. These vessels weigh about 100 ton and are used to destroy submarines. It is now that\n\nwe begin to realise the great fleet of vessels which although not in the \"Limelight\" yet form& prove to be a very important factor in \"The Fleet of England\".\n\nIt is only by these crafts doing their little bit, that the main divisions can operate. PortSaid was build by the builders of the canal. The chief building is the \"Admiralty House\" a very nice building. The native quarters are separate from the European. This town is the \"Garbage Tip\" of the World &one is better out of it. We were not allowed off the ship as the town is under Martial Law. Serveral Aust. Soldiers came over. The 7th Light Horse are at El. Kantara\n\nThe 10th Light Horse had a scrape & came off second Best. Waited till 4PM when all officers & nurses returned, four of the sisters were thrown into the water by colliding with a Naval Pinnace. They wererescued after a little time in the water. We started at 5PM & to begin nearly ran into a vessel about 2 feet separted the vessels. Made way passing French & British Warships of the second line. Each gave us a hearty cheer which we returned. The Breakwater is over a mile in length & in the middle is a \nphoto\n ? statue of the constructors of the Canal M. de. Lesseps Meadefor Alexandria passing\n\na couple of British Destroyers\n","45":"\n\nArrived at Alexandria at 8AM & anchored outside the Breakwater till Pilot came on. Came into the outer harbour & anchored about 2 miles from the city. There is a large amount of shipping, including warships of the allies. Had boat drill. Boats were lowered into the water & we had to slide down the ropes into the boats a distance of 30 feet. Most of us suffered from burns, owing to the friction with the ropes. pulled out about 1\/2 mile & set sail & returned to the ship, very stiff & dirty. Given leave from 3PM till eleven o'clock.\n\nWent ashore & had a look at the ruins of the Bombardment ofAlexandria 1882 by the British. From this date England ruled Egypt & appointed a Sultan. Walked through the native quarters to the city, which has beautiful buildings but narrow streets. The population consists of Greeks, Arabs & Egyptians,also French. The native quarters are very dirty. Most of the city is blocked to soldiers also the large hotels which are reserved for Officers. There are thousands of Tommies in town on leave from the desert. Had a look around in a \"Garry\" a\n\nkind of buggy. There are trams also. Returned to the ship which took an hour to get to owing to there being no breeze.\n","46":"\n\nLeave from 1 PM till 11 PM. Very hot in sun. Went to shore about 2 PM and with 5 others went to the \"Cater-Combs\" a large burial ground dug into the earth. Constructed by the Egyptians captured by Roman Empire about 2000 years ago - buried their people & Kings, also Kings horses. British Govt found it 50 years ago & dug the earth out. It now stands as it was\n\nwhen first completed. The material is sand-stone & paintings of people buried are still on the walls also you can see the skulls & large bones of the dead. A chamber is partitioned off for each family & as a member died he was built in and a stone put over him. The depth in earth is over 100 feet. Came back in a \"Garry\" to the square, passing Pomper's Column & sphinx. Once a Roman Emperor. Also went through native Bazaars etc. Arrived at square which is simple great. Lovely white building of a great height &\n\ngardens in the middle of a very wide street. Caught Sida-Bishr tram & went out to Victoria. Passed through very pretty districts evidently the elite suburbs. The trams are much better than any we have come across. Have double deckers, & are fast, also cheap 1\/2 P.T. for 8 miles. Had a look at the","47":" B.G.H. & met an Australian who showed us where to get a decent meal. Had tea & walked around town coming up to the casino (A cabaret). Music & dancing etc. while you have a drink. Stayed here\n\nfor some time, then walked toSquare getting a tram to the wharf. Cost","48":" P.T. for 30 minutes run. Passed the Sultan's Residence. It is the custom here to sit out on the footpath & have Refreshment. The Mosques are splendid buildings, but we are not allowed in to see the inside. Caught a boat & took an hour's sailing to get to home. & we were not sorry being very tired.\n","49":"\n\nThis day is just an ordinary day here. Friday being their sacred day.\n\nPulled into a wharf at 7 AM. to take on3 A.G.H.\n\nDid heavy fatiques all day preparing for the No 3 A.G.H. Had to mount guard at 5 PM\n","50":"\n\nThe No3 A.G.H arrived at 4.45 AM. some 450 people so the ship is well packed. ook stores on & ship was painted. The harbour is full of transports & there are several hospital ships in. Left at 4 PM & made out to sea. The weather is pretty cool & the sea rough.\n","51":"\n\nDid a little fatique work & have read the rest of the day. Sea is calm again. Weather cooler. Four warships came up tonight to see who we were & then went.\n","52":"\n\nDid a little fatigue & was finished for the day. Read & slept the rest of time. Ship did a good run doing 350 miles. The weather is still cooler & will have to go outof shorts. Had an impromptu concert at night. Destroyer came up to see who we were.\n","53":"\n\nDid usual fatigues. Have been changed from boat 9 to No. 7 am glad too. Had boat drill. All patients were brought up on deck which gave us plenty of hard work. All were at their respective stations in 8 minutes. Have been\n\ninsight of land for some time. Had little work to do\n","54":"\n\nDid a few minutes work & read & slept the rest of the day. There are very few fatigues doing as the3 A G H occupy most of the ship. Had a windy concert but left when it started. Lost sight of land as we are making across to the \"Rock\"\n","55":"\n\nDid a minutes fatigue but spent some time with the dentist. Came in sight of Spain early in afternoon. The sea was without a ripple. Saw a Periscope following us up\n\nbut it went into the shadow of the land which like the coast of Africa is very precipitous only that of Spain has a little vegetation on it & a few houses. Had a concert at night given by the 3rd A.G.H. Slept on deck, awoke at 3 AM by several searchlights who flicked their stream of light on us making it as bright as day. Behind these was a big dark object the shape I need not explain. On going to the West of this rock a very pretty sight awaited us. The Rock was studded with light & streams of lights stretched across the straits & in the vicinity\n","56":"\n\nAnchored. The air is very fresh so went to bed. The sight by day is far better than by night. It is simple beautiful. On the waterline are very pretty towns. Three in all. Although it is solid rock folige grows on the side. On top against the sky line can be seen anti-aircraft & submarine guns; but the guns one cannot see. they are evidently concealed in caves. The shipping in the Breakwater \nwas\n ismostly warships. Some came out & they can travel too. As one looked at this fortifications he felt proud that it was in the hands of the\n\nBritish. Opposite the Rock on Spanish soil is a small town at the bottom of a large mountain where the treaty concerning Morocco was formed. A large cloud enveloped the Rock about 9AM so cameras were cheated wholesale. Fromthe Rock you can see the coast of Morocco. Left at 9.30 AM & made at 15 knots to Southhampton. Passed Trafalgar Bay, but could not see it plainly. Had church service as usual at 10 AM & 7.30 PM\n","57":"\n\nDid fatigue. Have had very calm weather. Heavy fogs till 2PM & it is\n\ncold & bleak. We go into field dress tomorrow. Now in Bay of Biscay. Had another concert tonight. Have written most of my letters.\n","58":"\n\nHad usual Physical Drill Passed a little shipping. Had a concert at night. Did 360 miles run today.\n","59":"\n\nCame insight of Isle of White about 6PM. could only see lights & search lights. Had a farewell & Thanks giving service. Had to use our overcoats. Anchored till we got a Pilot on board. pulled\n","60":"\n\nup at \nHetney\n Netley where the largest Military Hospital is in the world. Aeroplane sheds are numerous. Passed the Castle where the Queen Mother resides in the summer. There are about a dozen Hospital Ships in as this is the depot & base for ships & wounded coming to England. The Aquitania 45,000 tons is anchored on opposite side of the wharf to us. It is a sight worth seeing. Has 4000 beds & travels at 30 Knots an hour. Its length is 900 feet odd & has 4 funnels & 9 decks. We came up to the docks. These docks hold about 5 vessels & there are a great number\n\nof them. Each dock has a dry dock in which a ship can go to be scraped & cleaned. There is a strict guard over Southampton & cameras are prohibited. The 3rd AGH disembarked & are said to be going to Brighton. We have to do fatigues tonight & may get leave \ntonight\n after we do them. Papers were eagerly scanned to see how the war was going. By it the war will continue some time yet & men are still wanted.\n","61":"\n\nPulled out from dock & went to No 36 wharf. Leave divided into three sections. I am in \"a\"stay on board the first three\n\ndays & have six consecutive days leave. It is very dull dreary weather. Blowing strong & raining. We, although on guard were given leave till 11PM. Walked around to have another look at the Aquitania & made for the town. It is very noticeable the dearth of young men. Old men & girls do the work. In the Post Offices the girls \nare\n run the place, also they are tram conductors. Went & did a little shopping & then had a walk around town. Saw the \"Bargate\" built 1643, used as a Police Station. We then went to see the \"Titanic\" Monument erected by engineers of the world to the Engineers who held on to the last in the disaster of 15th April 1912.\n\n\n\nseveral ofthe churches are very old. The trees are just beginning to \nget leave\n shed their leaves. The houses are small, have no verandahs also they generally have vines or flower beds & pot plants growing or hanging on the front of the buildings. The trams are double deckers & are fast. Had tea & returned to the ship fairly wet. At night, the place is in darkness owing to the\"Zeps\". By the papers Australia is calling up single men.\n","62":"\n\nThe streets are very narrow. It is noticeable that N.S.W has copied England in most of her works & ways\n\n\n\nThe 3rd class in train here is equal to the N.S.W. first \nB\n besides being much faster. At night time all blinds have to be pulled down so not to give a\"Zep\" the idea of which way the train is running.We obtained leave till midnight, So our guard of three days has been very nice. With two others we walked down the docks to the town. All lights are shaded at the top even on trams. In the streets there are no lights nor in shop windows. Even the lights in the shops are shaded. Here you can easily realise that war is on. Had a walk around the town changing our Australian notes & silver at the\n\nbank. Went through the \"common\" & Park. Bought some Printing paper & then had dinner. Men are served first here, ladies have to wait till the men are served. Of course this habit or method is only for the war period. Having spent over 90 minutes at dinner, we caught a tram to the Floating Bridge which we have to cross to go to Netley Hospital which at the present was our desired destination. Passed through lovely country & we took good notice as we walked although it was 4 miles. Having often read of the country Lanes & Hedges we were naturally interested. They are\n\nindeed more picturesque than our fences. The streets\nour\n or Lanes are not wide but are well made. The villages too are very pretty. The Houses have no verandahs, but creepers cover the walls. The fields although small to ours are very green & the soil is rich. Along the Hedges are Blackberry Bushes & perhaps we spent too much time at these, for we arrived at the Abbey later than we anticipated. First we went into an English Church in a sequestered spot amongst the Oak & Ash trees. with no noise to disturb\n\nthe solemnity. How I wished that our churches were like this without the noise, & also without\n\nthe bareness of the walls. One could only wish for this in Australia. Passing on we came to the ruins of the Abbey A Cisteran Monastery, built in 1239 & inhabited for over 300 years by the Abbots & Monks who lived pure lives here & died there\n\n\"Here man more purely lived. less oft doth fall,\nMore promptly rises, walks with stricter heed,\nMore safely rests, died happier is freed -\nEarlierfrom cleansing fires, and gains withal\nA brighter crown\" (Wordsworth)\n\nIn 1537 Henry V111 dissolved the monasteries of England & from that date it was neglected. I will give a\n\ndiscription of the ruins.\n\nWe passed through an Elizabethan Arch & passed into the Refectory or dining Hall. It measured 132 feet by 34 feet. Passing this we went into an Elizabethan Kitchen constructed of Bricks. The chimneys had double flues. Going through into the Cloister Court about 100 feet square, you can imagine the monks walking around learning Latin etc. In the centre is a fountain or rather was. Leaving this we pass into the church. & how grand & magnificent. Looking towards the Altar you see remains of the East Windows of wonderful design, upon which the Ivy clings. On the south side are to be seen remains\n\nof arches & columns. The interior length is 211 feet & the width of nave 57 feet & that of the transept 117 feet. The plan is that of a Latin Cross. A tower existed but the four foundations are ony left. The height is unknown, but it was said to form a landmark to shipping.\n\n\"with pensive beauty shadows fall.\nAcross the mossy mould ring wall,\nFrom which the cluster'd arches rise,\nAnd point the gazer to the skies.\"\n\nThis piece gives a good idea of what one sees from the bottom. We next went into the Sacristywhere the consecrated vessels & vestments were depostited. The roof is formed of three bays with ground stonework. Other rooms visited\n\nwere the Monk's day room which leads to the dormitories above Next the Guest Room & Sub-terranean Passage, used in case of seige or escape. It was also used as a fishing pond so as the monks need not go out to the outside world to get fish. Several people were buried there, but little remains of the tombs. Signs of the moat around the monastry are visible. Leaving here we set out to see the Netley Hospital which is 2 miles on. Coming to a Village Inn we decided to have tea. As I have read. I saw it although there was liquor. The tables, counter, chairs around the fire place an organ in the corner & two old men\n\ntalking. The lady a very homely person made us at home & gave us a good plain tea which we enjoyed heartily. the people are very quiet & very well mannered although perhaps they are a little slow & behind times Leaving here we made to the station, it being too late to go to the Hospital. Arrived in town & after a walk round went back to the ship as it is a dreary place without lights.\n","63":"\n\nHave to remain on board to day in case of emergency. Got up at 8 AM & enjoyed a breakfast of English sausages & bacon. Have written several letters & much surprised to get 3 letters from home dated\n\n14th to 19th August, evidently the ones missed at Melbourne. Tomorrow I go on leave for six days. & intend staying in London two days. Had roast poultry for dinner so have not done too bad. The weather is not so bad now, but is still dull.\n","64":"\n\nDoing Fatigues? we were given leave for six days. so with a chap named Hale we went to the Railway & caught a train for London (Waterloo). This took 2 1\/2 hours passing through beautiful fertile country. The Green grass caught ones eye. It is a bright fresh green. The\n\n\n\nfields are divided by hedges. The fields are small. Hay is the chief product, & sheep are in a few of the fields. On arrival in London we asked a Policeman how to get to the Y.M.C.A. He told us to get Bus 8 & so we had our first ride in an Omnibus. We passed through Oxford Street & arrived at our destination. The place was crowded so we went to a Branch, named \"Shakespear Hut\" Having dinner we were directed to the Tower of London (By a policeman. This body of men have gained a great reputation for smartness & knowing their duty, & it is to them that\n\n(Page 92)\n\npeople make to when in doubt. Their answer is out immediately & they direct you by the nearest way. They know London from start to finish & how to get from one place to another. On arrival at the Tower \n&\n a detective kindly took our cameras away from us & said he would mind them. Now the Tower of London was first built by William the Conqueror in the 12th Century. The Architecture is of the Norman Period. this Tower was occupied by our Kings till the reign of Charles \n11\n From then it became a prison for prisoners of High birth. A large\n\nmoat is around the Tower. Passed through the Lion Tower & BywardTower. The traitors Gate once used as an entrance is on the Bank of the Thames. Through this gate passed Queen Elizabeth, Lady Jane Grey, Duke of Somerset & many others who went either to prison or the scaffold. Opposite this gate is the Bloody Tower named in 1597 being the scene of the murder of Edward\n V\n & Henry \nV1\n Sir Walter Raleigh use to walk here when in prison. the next thing we went into see was the Crown Jewels. The Imperial State Crown was originally made by for Queen Victoria's coronation\n\nin 1838. the crown has 3000 diamonds, 280 Pearls in it & has the famous \"Cullinan\" diamond the largest in the world. King George & Queen Mary crowns are to be seen. The Imperial swords etc are also there. the White Tower is the oldest part of the fortress. This building was started in 885 A.D. & finished in 1709. Its height is 100 feet. All the ancient armoury is kept here & one can see the different weapons of war from time to time. The Dungeons of the Tower were used to keep \"prisoners in\". Next we went through the Chapel of St John it being\n\nthe scene of the marriage of Queen Mary. in 1554. the moat is now used as a parade ground for soldiers. Leaving the Tower we had a look at the Tower Bridge. This bridge is a great height & lifts up at the middle to let shipping pass. Passing on we worked our way through the traffic across to the London Bridge & covered the ground where the London Fire was in 1666. Arriving at St Pauls Cathredal we went in & had a look at the place where Wellington & Nelson are resting. It is a lovely church & most magnificent from the outside. Returning to town\n\nby the tube railway from Charing Cross to Tottenham Court Road. These conveyances are marvellous & travel at a great speed. they are 70 feet below the street, above them are the underground Railways. Had tea & made for the Strand & Trafalgar Square. The place is in Total darkness & it is hard to find out any place. Went to the Colliseum Theatre, largest in London. It is certainly wonderful. the play was not much. Returned to Y M C A & had a much desired rest. Our first impression of London is that it is well one cannot explain. The size is too great for\n\nimagination\n","65":"\n\nWe arose early as we wanted to see the ruins of the Zeppelin which was brought down in Essex. A policeman directed us & taking a tube we got out at Old Street & had a 10 minutes walk to a church where the ruins were. Most of it was charred. The length of it was 800 feet. The framework is like the ribs of a large animal. Leaving here we made back to the Y.M.C.A. by tram. These trams are double deckers but are very slow. Had a short lecture on London & Westminster Abbey & at\n\n10 o'clock with a party of 30 others (including Tommies, Canadians & Australians) caught a tube to Charing Cross. From here we walked through Government Offices & Barracks. At the Gates were two guards of the \"Blackwatch\" The man & horse stood as if a statue. Passing on we came to the King's secretary's residence & saw the changing of the guard a sight all visitors to London see. It was a grand military spectacle, the men being so well drilled. The band too was excellent. It now being 11 c'clock we entered into Westminster Abbey\n\nThis Abbey was started in the 12th Century & eachreign has added some on: hence we have different pieces of work & Architecture which is wonderful & most marvellous. It is here that most of England's early soverigns were buried. The coronation chair has been removed & the tombs covered with sand bags in case of an aerial attack. Some of Englands greatest men have been buried here, & statues to statesman, Poets etc are to be seen. The Abbey will never be completed as the foundations are not strong enough\n\nto hold the weight. The tower was to be one of the largest in England. Leaving this we crossed over to Houses of Parliament a very fine building which is over 800 feet long. A number of the House of Commons kindly showed us over the building. We first went through the \nLoungge\n Lounge & smoke room & then passed into Westminster Hall, the only part of Parliament House that escaped the Fire of London in 1666. It is here that all the Royal Functions up to Queen Victoria have been held; it is also the place where Oliver Cromwell was declared\n\nRuler of England & ten years after, it was here that he was dragged to prison. Charles \n1\n was tried & convicted here, his death warrant was read out to him as he stood there. Below this is St John Chapel another place used by the Royal families.\n\nLeaving these ancient places we enter into the House. In the centre is the speaker's chair & on either side are the members seats. Passing on we come to Library & writing rooms. In the hall we come to the House of Lords a much\n\nbetter furnished place than the House of Commons. In this House a place is reserved for the King & Queen & Prince of Wales, The King is not allowed in the House while it is sitting. The procedure is the same as in House of Commons. A passage \nthat\n connects both Houses, so if the speaker of House of Lords summoned the Commons they could easily reach it. This place is heavily guarded. Tea gardens are provided on the banks of the Thames & we saw the place where the five members escaped. From here we went & had dinner & then\n\nmade for Buckingham Palace. A statue of Queen Victoria in front of the Palace is magnificent. All water is drained out of the ponds etc as light on water causes a shine & thus it might prove a guide to the \"Zepps\". Obtained permission to see the Kings Horses some 86 & they are of course, very good stamp of animals. The harness is worth seeing. Some of it weighs over 112 lbs. It is Gilt. The State Coach 80 feet long took 3 1\/2 years to build & has been used by eight Kings. This coach is only used for coronation & opening of Parliament. It is 4 tons in weight, &\n\ndrawn by eighteen horses. The diameter of wheels is 7 feet. Leaving here we separated. I came back to the Y.M.C.A. & then went to St Pancras Station & caught train to Liverpool. Arrived at Liverpool 9 PM & caught boat for Belfast at 10.15 PM. Never have I put in such a trip. The boat 800 tons could only take 20 passengers in saloon & so the travelling was unpleasant.\n","66":"\n\nArrived at Belfast after 14 hours rough sea trip, having had no sleep. On our way to the wharf we passed Harland &\n\nWolfe's crane, the largest in the world. I believe it can lift 400 tons. Many ships were on the slips & in the water. The fastest Battleship in the world was alongside almost completed. It is the H.M. Glorious having a speed of 35 - 40 knots (50 - 60 miles) per hour. Has four 15 inch guns, & very peculiar masts, something like the American Battleships; Having several towers on a mast: Taking a motor car we went to the Great Northern Railway & had dinner & a wash. Our train left at 3 PM. the Irish trains are not as up-to-date as the English. Passed through Linen\n\nmanufacturing towns & farming Districts. The fields in Ireland are not so large as in England & all are divided by Hedges. Hay seemed to be the chief thing grown & this is used for the cattle in the winter. The grass is lovely at present. Arrived at Dromore Road about 7 PM finding my Uncle Charles waiting for me. He gave me a great welcome & we jumped into his Jaunting car & went to Lakemount a distance of 1½miles along the country road. Met Aunt Alice, Uncle Jim & a niece of Aunt Alice's. Had tea and a good talk & then went to bed.\n","67":"\n\nUncle woke me up at 8AM & I had a bath then breakfast. Then we had a look around the house & garden, also saw the old bathing House & pond. It is a very nice House & they grow alll their own vegetables & fruit. The weather was not favourably but I took a few snaps of the house. In the afternoon we went down to the town which has a population of 800 or so. Passed the old church my grandfather went to in his boyhood days. which is now a ruin. The present church is very large having seating accomodation for 900 people. It has a fine\n\norgan. Uncle & I stayed while Aunt & Colly returned with the car. Went to see the Marshalls & then had tea at Uncle Jim's place. He has also a large house & grounds. Went to the harvest festival held in the church at night. Uncle Jim is a grand old fellow & a character.\n","68":"\n\nUnfortunately I had to go to day. Had breakfast & then all of us went out irrespective of the wet weather. Uncle took a gun. Aunt went for mushrooms. We separated somehow so Uncle & I went on after rabbits. the dogs did\n\nthe scouting but evidently the rabbits had a day in as we only saw two. However we had a look at the cattle & fields. came home & had a read, also looked a the Medals of Waterloo & South African wars. Aunt Alice came home later with a basket full of mushrooms. Had dinner & 4 PM left in car for station with Uncle Charlie. Uncle Jim also came. The train left at 4.8 PM & arrived in Belfast 8.15PM having to change at Clones. Took a Jaunting car\n\nto the wharf & booked a saloon. A much better\n\nboat than I came \non\n over in. Arrived at Fleetwood 5.30 AM\n","69":"\n\nHad breakfast on the boat & caught the 6.30 AM train to London. Passed many manufacturing towns & pastoral districts. Arrived in London 12.30 PM. Went to Y.M.C.A. & had dinner then went to the Strand & had a look around the city. Caught a bus & went to Maida Vale to see Mrs Atkinson. Found the place without much difficulty. The colonel & she gave me a hearty welcome. \nAfter\n After a talk we went to see the\n\nSomme Battle at the New Theatre. It was very good although too realistic. Came back & had tea. Left for 10 PM train to Southampton. Arrived at ship 1 AM with plenty of work to do, as the patients are about to come on.\n","70":"\n\nVery cold & did fatigues all day & at night. Went to bed very tired indeed.\n","71":"\n\nMonday 16th October 1916\n\nEmbarked 400 patients all being cot cases, so you can guess the work we had to do. I had to watch a Mac Noonfor a few hours. We left\n\nSouthhampton at 3PM passing the \"Brittanic\" & \"Aquitania\". Have been allotted to E5 Ward. There are 55 patients all cot & surgical cases. All were wounded in Pozieres battle; of June 16.\n","72":"\n\nUp at 6 AM & in ward. Did not leave it till 7 PM tonight. Am very tired. Had to walk the \"Mac Noons\" on boat deck for an hour. So to days work is finished.\n","73":"\n\nReveille at 6 AM. Go to wards & wash patients, then make beds. Prepare for breakfast & serve up. There\n\nare 32 between two of us so we have our hands full. Wash up & then tidy ward for inspection Got dinner at 1 PM & then stay in ward till tea time 5.30 PM. Wash up & remain in ward till 9 PM till night orderly relieves you.\n","74":" Ocober 1916\n\nDid the same work as usual & am very tired. The ship is running very well doing 350 miles each day.\n","75":"\n\nWent into \"shorts\" today & feel much better. All patients are still cot cases\n","76":"\n\nDid usual work; only knew it was the sabbath by having Pork for dinner.\n","77":"\n\nArrived at St Vincent Island 3PM one of the Cape Verde Islands. The coast is very similar to the rest of African Coast, very precipitous & rocky. this place belongs to Portugal & since they declared war England has taken it over. The Brit. Cruiser Royal \nAlfred\n Albert\n\nis in port. All lights had to be put out at 6.30 PM as a submarine said is expected on the harbour. The inhabitants are Portuguese. We are taking on coal & water. The harbour is a very nice natural harbour although unprotected & has a population of a couple of thousand. It is one of the six Verde Islands. Had a very dark night as all lights were put out.\n","78":"\n\nShip very dirty with coal dust. The township is very picturesque, with Red & Green houses\n\nstanding out with the precipitous cliffs behind, & vapour rising on the summit of the hills. Oranges seemed the chief fruit grown here. No vegetation is to be seen from the harbour, & the island seemed very barren. We left at 6 PM & started on a 14 day trip to Durban.\n","79":"\n\nSea somewhat rough, & weather hot. Shipped & few seas in, one of which gave me a good ducking & plenty of work. The patients are progressing favourably.\n","80":"\n\nThe sea is very calm\n\nbut it is very hot working in the wards. At night we have to walk the :Mac Noons\" for one hour.\n","81":"\n\nDid the usual work; the sea is still calm & nothing of interest has happened. Did 349 miles run for the day.\n","82":"\n\nPassed the Equator at 3.30 PM to day, At night we had a concert by \"staff\" to the patients. The Mac Noons also gave various items not on the programm\n","83":"\n\nPatients had services\n\nat 10.30 AM 7.30 PM for Cot Cases, he came down to the wards & said a few words in the afternoon. Having a \"Head\" sea we only did 306 miles. Had a good tea. Salmon, Peas, Aspargus, Beetroot & spuds, & then oranges & apples, so we thought that Xmas had come a little earlier.\n","84":"\n\nStarted down in the dental Ward relieving & do not like it. There are ten \"Mac Noons\" & one is not too safe down with them. It is much cooler now.\n","85":"\n\nDid the usual ward work with the extra 3 hours down in the Mental Ward. One had to be put in the cell, it taking four men to do it. The ship did 326 miles.\n","86":"\n\nRed Cross goods were given out to the patients - tobacco & chocolates etc. it is exceptionally cold to day. We all are waiting for the news of the Conscription Referendums. We have heated arguments on it.\n","87":"\n\nUsual work in ward. It is much cooler. The sea\n\nis calm & nothing much has happened\n","88":"\n\nSame routine as usual. Did 298 miles run\n","89":"\n\nConcert held on Deck. It is very cold, & we saw a few Albatrosses following us.\n","90":"\n\nChurch services held for patients at 10.30 AM & 7.30 PM. It was a lovely day, typical Australian climate.\n","91":"\n\nDid ordinary work. Down in Mental Ward. All patients are restless. One tried to get on deck, but was carried down & put in a\n\ncell till he gets over the fit of temper. It is a dreary place & a day passes slowly, as you have to sit down & watch them. Two had a fight & have been locked up. While I was feeding the man in the cell with a mate the lights fused. We immediately closed all doors & got out of the room.\n","92":"\n\nAll are talking of the Melbourne Cup although we do not know who the horses are. Turned around the cape to day making for Durban.\n","93":"\n\nSea very calm, passed\n\nDelagoa Bay & Port Elizabeth at 2PM. It seemed very small. Arrived at Durban at 9 PM but had to anchor out till the morning in a heavy swell which was very uncomfortable. the Pilot came on board at 6 AM & we proceeded in to Port Natal which is not very large although pretty. The lighthouse is situated on the Bluff & the whale industry is carried on there. There were three whales on the bank.\n","94":" Novemnber 1916\n\nStarted coaling & taking on water immediately. Patients were given leave from 1PM to 8PM. The trams\n\nwere free to all. I relieved down in the Mental ward till 5 PM & then had till 11 PM off. The patients were all off & I had difficulty in keeping them down. Port Natal is small. Has about six wharves. An Australian Transport A 30 arrived in the afternoon from Melbourne. Took a tram (much the same as in London double deckers) to the Town Hall which is a very fine building. The approach is very picturesque. Walked around the town which has really only one main streeet. The population of Durban is 75,000 half of which are whites. The\n\nclimatical conditions are similar to the southern portion of Australia. After having tea we went to the Town Hall & had a look at the Somme Battle pictures. The interior of the hall is very nice & it has a fine organ. Livingis very high & most of the work is done by the Zulus & Kaffirs who are very fine black races in respect to build & physic.\n","95":"\n\nThe patients were taken by motors etc, to Mitchell Park where an official luncheon was given by the Mayor of Town to the wounded. The people of Durban treated the lads well & made them welcome\n\nto anything they wanted. I had 2 hours leave untill 3 PM when all had to be back as the ship was supposed to leave at 4 PM. I went to the beach which is very pretty. Surfing & swimming is the chief sport & the baths are fairly large. Arriving at 3PM we were given leave till 5.30 PM so with M Hale we went around the residential portion of Durban in a tram, passing through very clean & picturesque suburbs. From the hills you can see all over Durban & Port Natal. On arriving back to relieve down in the Mental Ward I found\n\nthat a patient had tried to escape\n\n& in doing so had knocked the sargeant unconscious. However they put two extra men down with me & the chap in a cell.\n","96":"\n\nA good number of people down to see us off. We left at noon & immediately ran into very rough seas which not only broke over the ship but broke all our crockery. All the dead lights had to be put down as the Ports were cracked. In the wards the mess was terrible. Dressing table, medicine etc all went over & smashed, even a heavy\n\nice chest tumbled over & smashed. In our quarters our boxes etc flew over the floor. We now easily realise how the \"Waratah\" went down with such a heavy sea. The Captain stopped the ship & put her head to it & there we remained till about 8AM when he decided that it was safe to proceed on our course. We had been pushed down south near the \"Roaring Forties\". I slept little at night as the roll prevented me.\n","97":"\n\nStill very rough and an exceptionally big roll on. Our work is twice as hard & walking is difficult. We put\n\nthe dishes on wet sheets to stop them from sliding off. It was also too rough to have church. Relieved from Mental ward & am glad. They put extra men down there now; so one has to look after 55 men after 2 o'clock & it is \"go for your worth\".\n","98":"\n\nStill a heavy sea, we did 306 miles run & the clock wemt for'ard an hour. Same routine as before. It is very difficult to write.\n","99":"\n\nSame Routine as previous days\n","100":"\n\nDid 330 miles run. The sea is calm & weather cool.\n","101":"\n\nSame Routine\n","102":"\n\nVery cold. Did 318 miles The sea is rough.\n","103":"\n\nHad concert at night someof the patients helped. One ofourdumb patients started speaking again giving us all a surprise.\n","104":"\n\nHad Divine Services. It is still rough & cold We did 332 miles.\n\nSeen two whales to day about 500 yards off. They \nare\n were small & similar to the porpoises. It is very cold. especially at \n6AM\n.\n","105":"\n","106":" routine as usual Did 315 miles. Coal strike heard of causing much debate.\n","107":"\n\nStill cold & cloudy. Did 311 miles. Had impromptu convert on \"Mess Deck\" after \"LIghts Out\" & severely reprimanded on morning parade.\n","108":"\n\nSame routine. Coal strike debates general\n\n\n\nalso will we be able to get coal. The detailed figures of conscription read with disgust. particularly N.S.W. figures.\n","109":"\n\nA little warmer today. Same Routine. Getting the wounded from the West ready to disembark.\n","110":"\n\nArrived at Fremantle about 3PM & anchored in the stream. There was a great number on the wharf to welcome the soldiers home. Patients were disembarked at dusk about forty in all. One lad died a few minutes before his parents came to the\n\nship. We took on coal sufficient to enable us to come to the East & return.\n","111":"\n\nLeft Fremantle at 6AM for Melbourne. Had usual church services. The sea is very calm\n","112":"\n\nSame routine as usual. Weather very cold.\n","113":"\n\nDid 289 miles today. The sea is still calm. Getting patients ready for disembarkation. An Inspection ofKits was held.\n","114":"\n\nU\ns\nual Routine. Doing little odd jobs ro expedite the cleaning of ship on arrival\n\nat port.\n","115":"\n\nTook most of the Red Cross goods down to the hold & packed away boards etc etc.\n","116":"\n\nCleaning up & final preparation for port. The sisters \nhave\n gave the patients a good spread of cakes & jellies for tea, also drinks. Have steamed at 4 miles per hour for a few hours being before our time. Land was sighted at noon. Have had an excellent trip altogether. It is so much warmer now.\n","117":"\n\nArrived in Port Melbourne\n\n8 AM & moored alongside Town wharf. One of the crew was pulled into the water & had a narrow escape from death. About 200 hundred motor cars on the wharf to take patients to hospital. The cot cases were put into the motor ambulances & taken away. Thousands of people waited outside the gates to welcome them home. Band played appropiate airs. All patients were disembarked by 11 AM & we then set to work to clean our wards which was accomplished by 2 PM Given a few days leave to come to Sydney. Left by the Sydney Express & had a tedious trip to Sydney\n\nThe country seemed well saturated with water & the grass looked green for this time of the year.\n","118":"\n\nArrived at Central Station 11 AM. Thousands of people waiting for the Special trains which were conveying the wounded over from Melbourne. Gave home folk a surprise & found them all well. Mascot has not altered & Sydney is also the same. Went to church at night & saw many old friends\n","119":"\n\nWent out visiting with my father. Saw Claude Ham, Dr Marshall & a couple of others. Went to the Water Board\n\n& had a talk with some of the chaps. Had visitors at night.\n","120":"\n\nWent out with mother shopping & visiting.

However, he was dissatisfied with the whole unit so ordered another inspection for Sunday. Fancy a full dress parade just as we cross the Equator in the hottest part of the Globe.

NumerousDhows(Canoes rowed by three men) came alongside to take us ashore. they are very frail & the\n\nleast movement makes them tilt to a dangerous angle. We landed at the Customs Wharf & made our way through a native quarter to the town. Here we noted the fine buildings as the Post Office. This building is constructed out of local basalt & yellow & white Kurla stone. the main hall is immense & has a large Dome. Posted letters & then went to Cooks to exchange our money. The streets here are not too clean. Bought a few articles & then went to Victoria Railway Station, supposed to be the finest in the World. This station is named after Queen Victoria\n\n& has a frontage of 1500 feet. The artchitecture is Italian Gothic type & is very beautiful. Opposite this building is the Municipal Offices another very fine building having a dome of 240 feet. Above all, the inhabitants of this island are very interesting. besides being very cosmopolitan the Parsirace seems to be predominant in this city, & all seem to hold goodpositions. Hindu people are also plentiful, & can be seen wearing bracelets & anklets. They wear nose rings if married. One\n\nsees many different dresses of all colours, which gives the street a picturesque touch. The chief conveyances are Trams, and Victorias. The latter are similar to Garries or like a buggy. The trams run from one end of the Island to the other. Had tea at the Taj-Mahal Hotel, named aftrer the fine building at Agra which was erected by a\nn\nPrince in memory of his wife the cost of the building was £3,000,000.

On the top of the hill is the Parsees' burial ground, known as the\n\nTowers of Silence. Here the dead of this race are put in the tower exposed to the air. Vultures wait for the bodies & then eat the flesh off the bones. This custom originated some three thousand years ago, out of sanitary as well as religious considerations.

Came back & had \narol\na final look at the city then walked along the main road to the Taj-Mahal Hotel for tea. Every European in Bombay seemed to be there & after an hours wait we had our tea. It was very intresting watching the different manners of the people. Fun started on the first floor in the Lounge when a couple of the boys took possession of the piano & gave songs etc.\n\nTwo English generals were there & many other officers of all ranks with their wives etc. The Karoola chaps entertained so well that the General shouted champagne to all the boys. One could see a private (merry ?) between two officers (merry ?) laying the law down that a private was as good as an officer & they agreed too. Leave expired at 1 AM majority rolled ? home at 5AM Ada Reeves was there & gave a couple of songs.\n","147":"\n\nAt 6 AM we weighed anchor & went into the Dock area.

The staff have to wear a large Geneva Cross on the left arm of their tunic. The ship took on coal & water today. All llights had to be out by 6 PM \nowing to\n as enemy aeroplanes are expected any time, & they would naturally go for shipping.
