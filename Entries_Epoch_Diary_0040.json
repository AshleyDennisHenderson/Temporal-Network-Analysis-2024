Left the train at Hornsby & got another to Lindfield & then one to St Leonards & Watson met us with his car there & brought us here (Lisheen). Got the car again in afternoon & Mrs Lloyd Eileen, Linda, Jo & Self went down to Manly & had a swim in the surf; it was not a good day at all as it was very choppy & lots of cross currents. Had afternoon tea at the Pacific & saw Olga. She looks very well, we missed Marj. worse luck. Mr LLoyd arrived home from Melbourne in \nafter\n morning. Linda & self sat on front porch after tea & had a long yarn about things in general.\n","22":"\nFine & warm. Linda, Jo and Self went to town in morning. Linda & self had our photos taken at the Burrlitz; we met Joagain and had dinner at Tissots and caught the 2.15 boat to Clifton Gardens We saw Mr& MrsAllison and the McMasters (Binnia) & had a swim then had tea with MrsAllison and home for dinner at night. It was a long day, but think we all enjoyed it. Miss Earle was at Lisheeninafternoon & stayed to tea. Linda & Self sat on Tennis court for a bit after tea\n","23":"\nFine & hot. MrLloyd & self went for a swim in Spit Baths before breakfast. The two Hunter boys & their sister, Reg Boyce & Lolacame in afternoon & we had some good tennis. Final leave up & I went back by 9.40 train to the Warren camp. I did not like the idea of going back either after the ten days holiday. Linda & Self both enjoyed that ten days very much I think & we both saw deeper into one another. Heard that all units had been put back a month & instead of us going in Feb we were going in March\n","24":"\nFine & hot. Had physical drill before breakfast & Lieut Rorke took us for Morse signaling after breakfast. Paid in afternoon so did no drill. Got the 20 past 4 train & got to Lisheen early. Linda & Self out on tennis court after tea, had a long talk over things & promised ourselves another before I left. Late leave was cut down to 4 per subsection so did not get late leave\n","25":"\nVery hot again & we had a drunk Sargent Major to drill us in \"marching past\" in morning in the Park & he did race us round. Got our second issue in afternoon so had no drill Got the 4.32 train in & 5.20 boat tothe bay. Linda & Jo in town all day & they were dead beat in evening when I got there. Lay on the tennis court for a bit after tea & then got the 9.45 train back to camp\n","26":"\nHot again. Was on cooks fatigue all day. It was a good day to get the job as the whole camp had to parade in drill order in front of the Colonel Pearce down by the railway. Got late leave & came in to Lisheen got the 6 oclock boat. Linda & Self lay on the tennis court & had a long yarn about matters. Got the 10.45 train back to camp.\n","27":"\nFine & very hot. Had some marching drill in the Riverside park, under Sargent Major Davidson in morning & I had my allotment papers fixed up in afternoon. We went out for a Route march in evening, leaving the Warren about 7.15 pm. We marched all round Marrickville, Dulich Hill ect & got back to camp about 10.15 pm. It was not a bad affair at all. It was the first night for a long time I had not seen Linda & I missed our nightly chat very much as it was the one thing I used to look forward to all day.\n","28":"\nFine & hot again. I was detailed off among others of","29":" to get the horse lines ready as 60 horses were coming to camp. We got fixed up & away by 3 pm. The 15\/1 was on duty & I got main guard. I was on guard at the gun park again. It was hard luck the 15\/1 striking duty as I could not get in to Linda for two nights. The horses arrived about 6.15 pm. They are not a bad lot, but too light for artillary horses.\n\nSaturday 5 February 1916\nRaining in morning but it cleared up in afternoon. We got off guard about 4.30 pm & I got the 5.40 train to Sydney, had a restat the Metropole & had a hot bath & then met Linda on the wharf. Got a taxi up to Tissots & had dinner & went to \"So Long Letty\" at Her Majesty's. It was the prettiest piece I have seen for a long time & not so board as I was led to believe. I think Linda liked it also, but she was very tired when we got home.\n","30":"\nFine & hot. Went down to the Spit with MrLloyd for swim before breakfast. Cleaning up my boots ect after breakfast. Linda, Jo & Self went down to Clifton Gardens in car after dinner & had afternoon tea & tea at night there. All the Allisons were there & the McMasters. Got the 8.25 boat back & nearly missed the train. Linda & Jo got back very late. We had a great day down there and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Linda & I had a great argument about former loves ect, she has the sounder reasoning, but my arguments are based on sentiment, which in these cases goes a long way.\n","31":"\nFine all day but rained at night. Took the horses out for exercise in morning, & went for a 12 mile ride on them in afternoon on them. They are a pretty poor lot & too light for artillary. I had a real good hack though. Horse picket in evening till 6 amTuesday morning. Its a better job than guard but not much of a job anyway. Wrote Linda in morning to say I could not get in at night.\n","32":"\nFine. All horse picket got leave off\nfrom\ntill 12 oclock & as there was nothing doing we did not drill in afternoon. Came out through the fence about 4 oclock & came in by tram Got over to Lisheen early. Luke Boyd, MrsRorke & Miss Nickol there. Got back to camp by 9.45 train. Took Miss Nickol back as far as the quay & put her on tram for Metropole.\n","33":"\nFine, but came on to rain at night & I had to sleep in the tent at night. Working for the Sargent Farrier in morning and carting dirt from Stables in afternoon. They put the horses in the waggons for the first time & they went first rate. with a few exceptions. Nicked away early & met Linda, Jo & MrLloyd on the wharf & came over with them. Got back to camp by 9.40train.\n","34":"\nShowery all day. Put up a tent for the Sargent Farrier, & lay in it & played cards all day.Nicked away early & met Linda & Jo on wharf & came over with them. Mr& MrsNorman Murray came over after tea but I had to go just as they arrived.\n","35":"\nShowery all day. Made a table for the Sargent Farrier in morning & played cards in his tent all morning. We had a riding test in afternoon the biggest farce imaginable.You rode about 20 ft & back & they say they can tell if you can ride or not by that. Cleaning harness in afternoon as well. The Colonel said we had looked after the horses well. Caught early train down & came straight to Lisheen. Gave Linda a bit of a surprise as I told her last night I was on horse picket & could not get off.\n","36":"\nFine most of the day, but there was a few misty showers. Got away from camp early & had breakfast at the Metropole. Met Linda & Jo at the Storesat 11 oclock & had morning tea with them. They came back to Lisheen to dinner & I went up to T.K.S for afternoon. It was Commemoration day there & I saw a lot of old mates. It seems very funny to go up there & see fellows that were at the prep in my time amongst the Old Boys now. Was back at Lisheen for tea. Linda & I took Jo over to meet the Allison's after tea & she went to \"So Long Letty\" with them.\n","37":"\nFine. We all went out for a launch picnic in afternoon up the Lane Cove river. MrLloyd hired a launch & we left about 2 oclock, picking up about a dozen more people between here & Milson's Point. We had tea just above Fig Tree bridge &went up about a couple of miles further after tea. Linda, Jo, Miss Nichol & Self saton roof coming home. Went back to camp at night.\n","38":"1916\nFine. On the guns in morning for the second time since being in camp. We were taught about the sights of a gun. Foot Slogging in Park in afternoon. The Casula & Liverpool men came out & started to riot in morning. At 4 oclock they called for volunteers to go - if necessary) to help quel the riot. We were not to have any arms only our fists. I volunteered, but we were not called out at all.There was one man shot at the Central station & many others wounded; lots of property was broken in the city.\n","39":"\nFine. On the guns again in the morning & more foot slogging in the afternoon. The rioters were quiet and most of them had gone back to camp. Came over to Lisheen at night and got back to Camp about 10.15 pm.\n","40":"\nFine. On the guns in the morning. At 12 oclock parade they called for volunteers to picket the Central Station & I stepped out amongst 102 others from 15\/1. We were given a hot meal at 4 oclock and left in special trams about 6.15. We were served out with service rifles and 20 rounds ball ammunition per man. We went to the Victoria Barracks & the other units were served out with rifles & ammunition. We went back to the Central in trams & picketed every entrance till 1 am& then had a special train back to Tempe. Nobody man, woman or child was allowed on the station without a ticket. The crowd was very quiet as a whole & beyond using the butt of the rifle half a dozen times, nothing happened at all exciting.\n","41":"\nFine & very hot. On the guns again in the morning and foot slogging in part in afternoon. We had no early morning parade, as we were not in bed till 3pm the night before. Came into Lisheen in evening for tea.\n","42":"1916\nFine & very hot. On the guns in morning, and had a lecture from the OC on the use of Artillary in modern warfare in afternoon. I came in to Lisheen in evening & we all went down to the Foxe's after tea. I did not have late leave so had to leave early. I was jolly glad to get out of the house too, as it was a fair cow sitting in the drawing room with a lot of old women I did not know, listening to them gas about nothing.\n","43":"\nVery windy & dusty. On the guns again in morning. I spent most of the morning taking a breech block to pieces and putting it together again. There are 23pieces in it and not one screw, every piece fits perfectly. Came into Lisheen in afternoon. Eileen went to the Kings after tea. MrsLloyd's eyes were very bad, as she had had them treated in the morning.

Linda & Self lay under the trees at back of house all afternoon and read & yarned.We went for a walk together in evening round over the hill & back by MrsRutgers'.\n","45":"\nFine & hot. Foot slogging in the park all the morning. The O.C (MrCampbell) delt with a petition we all signed & gave up to him, asking him to remove Sargent Major Fulkesas we thought he was not competant to drill us. He said it was open mutiny to send up that petition, but he just treated it as foolishness, which it was. If I had read the thingI would never have put my signature to it.\n\nGot late leave and also got the early train to Sydney. Got my watch glass put in at Hardy's and asked P.S.&B to get me a box for Wednesday night at the Criterion. Had late leave & Linda & self went to the Cremorne Pictures.Went home in the 11.35 train to Marrickville.\n","46":"1916\nFine & very hot. Foot slogging in Park all morning.

Arm very sore at night.\n","49":"\nFine most of day, but had some heavy storms at night. We had a day off as our arms were very sore. I had a bad cold as well, so was not feeling to fit on it. Came in with Spes Wharton in a taxi and had afternoon tea at Farmer's and came over to Lisheen. Went back in a taxi with Hosking & McInnis out of the 5\/2 DAC.\n","50":"\nFine & cooler. I was on Cook's fatigue all morning and got leave till 6 pm but did not go back till late. Had dinner with Spes Wharton at Petty's and came on over to Lisheen. Had a yarn with Linda on tennis court. She said \"that anything she asked me to do was not worth doing\". Altho' in a few things that may appear to be the case on the surface, I think that she knows it is not really the case. I often could have done things in town but I came over here instead, so in a way I am in the wrong. Anyway it hurt, whether I am right or wrong.\n","51":"\nFine. Was put on horse picket in morning for a bit then I was put on to cooks fatigue. Finished up about 2 oclock and came over to \"Lisheen\". Got back to camp by the 9.40 train.\n","52":"1916\nFine.

Met Jo & Linda again and had some tea and went out to Watson's Bay in tram and came back by boat. Had tea with father at Petty's and he went home after.

Had afternoon tea at the Hotel & drove up to the Entrance to Port Hacking My word things have changed wonderfully down there lately. Its quite a town where a few years ago was only scrub. Saw Jessie for a few minutes. Got back in time for late tea, and got back to camp at night.\n","66":"\nFine. With Campbell and Raymund in\nafternoon\nmorning learning to use the director.

On light duty all day and came out to Lisheen in evening.\n","70":"","71":"\nWe went then to Butterworths hotel for dinner and a hot bath. I never enjoyed a bath so much before. After dinner we went to the Criterion Theatre corresponding to the Sydney National Amph. The show was rotten. Got back to the boat about 10.30 pm after a most interesting day.\n\nDurban is a great little place the cleanest& prittiest place I have ever seen. The town itself is only small but there are some fine buildings in it & they are very well set off. The Berea aresidential quarter is on a ridge overlooking the town;and it is just like an English home only there is more luxurient growth. The homes and gardens are just perfect. No fences around them either. Just hedges of all descriptions.\n\nP.T O\n","72":"June\nThen there are the black population. Zulus, Swazis Cape boys, Indians & others. The Zulus are the finest made niggers you would ever see anywhere. They form the biggest percentage of the rickshaw boys. The rickshaws seat two sometimes three, and are pulled by big buck niggers with all sorts of headresses. Most of them have polished bullock horns on their heads and feathers ect also. Its a very up to date place takeit all through and the roads are just perfect.\n\nSent a cable to Linda & posted some letters.\n","73":"","74":"\nWrote & posted a lot of letters aftertea and then we went for a walk round the beach & town for a few hours. Then we got rickshaws down to the ferry; got to boat about 10.30 pm and found she was to sail at 8 amnext day. We had a good time in Durban and had a fair reception The men behaved them selves very well. There were no rows at all that I know of and only about half a dozen got drunk. All very sorry to leave Durban.\n","75":"","76":"\nopen and the men could get as much drink as they liked & a lot came back drunk. There were some drunken rows in the town but not many. They put a 12 pounder naval gun and 1000 rounds of ammunition. They put it in the stern.\n\nCape Town is a very pretty place I should say coming up the Bay on a clear morning. You see the town on the waters edge and then rising directly behind it are the cliffs of Table Mount and on one side the Devils Peak and the other Signal Hill & behind that the Lions Kloof. It is quite a different place from Durban. Its an older place and the streets are very narrow and\n\n\n\n8thJun\nthere are no very big public buildings or parks like there are in Durban. The people too are more Dutch and not nearly so friendly. The blacks too are scarcer their places being taken by Cape Boys or halfbreeds. There are no ricksha's either. The docks are all made up inside the breakwater and they are very cramped with a very narrow entrance, scarcely wide enough to fit a ship in easily.\n","77":"\nold place. Its grounds cover a couple of thousand acres I suppose, & there are all the South African game grazing in big paddocks there & the other animals & birds in cages. The home itself is a beautiful white stone place standing in a park of\n€‹\ngiantic\ngigantic old pine & English oak trees. When you look at the way he looked after his home & think offall the things he did for the Empire after coming to SA as just a missionary you realise what a great man he really was. We got back to the ship about 5 pm and my word those who did not go ashore who could have done so where whipping the cat. The \"Beltana\" came in\n\ntoday with more Australian troops aboard and the \"Marathon\" came in last night with the","78":"Brigade from Victoria on board. They say we wont get away from here till the end of the week, but hope its not true.\n","79":"June 1916\nthe cable on instead of the note. Anyway I would like five minutes with them. We struck a fairly\nrolling\nbig sea outside and rocked a bit but not nearly as much as the other boats. We show no lights at night now & if we want to light a pipe we must get into cover. No noise is allowed either after dark. Its pretty awkward I can tell you getting about in our confined space in the dark. If you dont run into a man you run into something else and bark all your shins.\n\n29thJune 1916\nwhich was sunk at the Dardenelles was waiting in the anchorage & she is to accompany us the rest of the way. We steamed out of the harbour about 6 pm & explored outside. The other boats all went in in turn. We got some postcards of Dakar & sent them home. Dakar is the capital of the French Senegal, but is practically only a naval port and only officials live there.\n\nWe had an impromptu concert at night and it was a treat to have the lights again.\n\nIf in this life you wish to win\nAnd rise above the common chump,\nTake off your coat & pitch right in,\nDon't wait, lay hold, hang on, & hump.\n\nIt ain't no use to grumble & complain\nIts just as cheap & easy to rejoice\nWhen God sorts out the weather & sends rain\nWhy, rain's my choice\n\nWho pants & struggles to be free,\nWho strives for others liberty,\nWho, failing, still works patiently,\nHe truly prays.\n\nWho, loving all, dare none dispise,\nBut with the worst can sympathise,\nWho for a truth a myrtyr dies,\nHe truly prays.\n\n\n\nPetitions are but empty air\nBrave action is the only prayer.\nThus learn to pray.\n\nAnnie Besant.\n\nI wish to be simple, honest, natural, frank, clean in mind & clean in body, unaffected€” ready to say \"I do not know,\" if so it be, to meet all men on an absolute equality€” to face any obstacle & meet every difficulty unafraid & un abashed. I wish to live without hate, whim, jealously, envy, or fear. I wish others to live their lives too€” up to their highest, fullest, & best. To that end I pray that I may never meddle, dictate, interfere, or give advice that is not wanted, no assist when my services are not needed. If I can help people, I will do it by giving them a chance to help themselves, and if I can uplift or inspire, let it be by example, inference & suggestion, rather than by injunction & dictation.\n\nElbert Hubbard\n\nLuck is the \"alias\" for pluck.€”\n\nHow fortunate is he who finds a new joy for each day\nIn doing well the things at which he works away;\n\nTo him the weeks are never long,\nAnd even if his wage be small,\nThere is upon his lips a song\nThat slaves may never learn at all.\n\nThis world that we're living in\nIs mighty hard to beat;\nYou get a thorn with ev'ry rose,\nBut ain't the roses sweet!.\n\nFrank. L. Stanton.\n\nThursday 11 May 1916\nA beautiful fine day. Revielle went at 3 amand after we had breakfast & headedup the lines we all marched out of the Warren Camp and trammed it down to the Woolloomooloo Wharf whereour troopship the A8 (SS Argylshire ). Linda & Mr Lloyd came into the tram and came last part of the way with me. We embarked at 8.15 amand went out and anchored off Garden Island. Lots of Launches round us all day. Linda, Jo, Mrs Lloyd and Mr Lloyd came out and saw me. Weighted anchor at 3 pmand started on our 2nd stage on the way to the War. Linda followed me down in the launch to the heads. Everybody on board very cheerful and as it was calm, very few got sick.\n\nFriday 12 May 1916\nFine & very cold, the sea as calm as it possibly could be, and very few sick.I slept on deck and it got very cold towards morning. We had no parades today as we go on duty at four oclock. Came up very cold in evening got my bedding up and went to bed early on deck.\n\nI wonder what Linda is doing to-day, and if she is worrying very much. I hope not as there is really no need as I am fairly comfortable and we could not possibly have a smoother sea or a steadier ship. There is practically no vibration.\n","80":"\nCold and showery all day.Our battery was on duty but they took the left Section for guard ect. I was mess orderly, and was also grabbed for fatigue €” carrying flour Spuds, dry rations ect €” from fore hold to saloon galley. We called in at Port Phillip about mid-day to pick up two ship's quartermasters who had deserted also to drop our mails. A torpedo destroyer took the mails. We ran into dirty weather in evening off Cape Otway, cold and rain and westerly gales.\n","81":"\nBitterly cold westerly gales with rain squalls and a very lumpy sea A lot of the fellows very seasick in morning but most brightened up towards evening. There was to be a church parade in morning but it was cancelled on account of the seasickness.\n\nWe all lay on the promenade deck all day like a litter of pups to keep warm. I never thought that I would be only too glad to curl up with every and anybody and sleep; but I was today. I was not homesick but I did want to be at Lisheen for a few hours. Saw the last of Australia for some time.\n\n\n","82":"\nBitterly cold westerly gales but the sea was not so lumpy. Still a lot of the fellows sea sick. We had a parade for half an hour and did some physical drill.\n","83":"\nStill cold gales, but a wonderfully smooth sea with them. I went into the hospital with the \"flu\" in the morning. Went to sleep as soon as I got in and did not wake till next morning.\n","84":"\nStill cold & windy. Spent the day in bed reading & sleeping. I felt much better in the evening. Warren Hogarth came in with the same dogs disease as I had.\n","85":"\nCold & windy again.They call it \"Sunny Australia\" but we have not seen the sun since we left Sydney a week ago today Still in with \"flu\"\n\nRoumer came round that we were going to England round the Cape.\n\nIf a person's religious ideas correspond not with your own, love him nevertheless. How different would yours have been had the chance of birth placed you in Tartary or India. €”\n\nShelley\n","86":"\nStill nice warm weather €” I dont think. Wireless came through that we are to go to England by the Cape. There is great rejoicing on board at the news. Though personally I dont think we will train long in England as there is not room. Everybody thought we would call at Freemantle to coal so all got busy & wrote to all friends relations ect Still in hospital. I feel quite well but evedently my temperature is high yet. Two fellows came in at 11 amthis morning and were still lying about at 9 pmtonight - just because the doctors forgot them. Left Australian Coast for good, although we have\n\n\n","87":"\nVery windy & cold. Still they keep me in hospital but may get out tomorrow.It seems ages since I came in here. Read all day. The time we took writing letters yesterday was wasted as we are not calling at Freemantle but making straight through to Durban.\n\nseen land since we left Cape Otway.\n","88":"\nA decent calm fine day the first since we left. Still in hospital & got a fresh cold on me. There was a church parade in the morning for all denominations and there was a kind of a hymn service in evening. Billy Hunter Warren Hogarth & Sarg. Macdougal were in a lot of the day yarning.\n","89":"\nVery windy & cold again. The docter would not let me out this morning. I asked him for medicine for my cold yesterday & again today but have not got it yet. Its a very rottenly run hospital anyway and none of the docters take any interest in anybody.\n","90":"\nStill blowing & a bit cold, but there was some sun during the day. I was allowed up for a few hours & was out on the deck in the sun. It was great to be out in the fresh air again, although I was very weak. There was a concert in the evening & it was a fair success I believe.\n\nThe gulf dividing Saint and sinner is neither wide enough nor deep enough to make a song about.\n","91":"\nA nice calm sunny day at last. I came out of hospital for good in morning. Capt Campbell told me to take it easy for a day or two. So lay in the sun all day & read & yarned. To day is Empire day - how different from last","92":" Then I was lopping trees for stock all day at 4D. We had a concert at night and it was not so bad. Some real good songs sung very well & some good comic Recitations.\n\nA cold windy day again.I found a warm spot in sun and read all day. Got some tarts & cocoa in the forward galley in the afternoon & had a good afternoon tea. It has been arranged for certain that we land at Durban and have a short route march & then we are dismissed. There are \"Mother Carys\" chickens following us all the time also the big albatrosses we saw in the bight.\n","93":"\nVery cold again & windy.I would give anything to get a bit of sun again I have missed it more than anything. I was on parade for the first time today for a bit, but was too weak to do much. There was to be a concert in the evening given by the Queenslanders but it was too cold & wet to give it.\n","94":"\nNo sun yet, but there was no wind today which was something to be thankful for. The 27th Battery put 4 teams against the 35th Bat. 9th Brigade Queensland and we each won two pulls. In the afternoon there was boxing tournaments in the afternoon. Just 3 round \"no decision\" bouts; but there were some tip top goes. Its Linda's birthday to day - her 21st. I would give anything to be with her for the day, but hope to be there next year, although I think I will be lucky to be home for her 23rd.\n","95":"\nCold & windy, but it was a following wind so it was not so bad. We had a church parade in morning. It looked very impressive; all the men in the sombre Khaki & the parson in his surplus with a Union Jack hung just under him. He is a very ragtime sort of preacher anyway. I wrote letters most of the afternoon, wrote father Linda, Spes Wharton and Mrs Allison. There was a Church service at night also, but I did not go.\n\n\n","96":"\nNot much sun yet, very windy, but it was a following wind and a following sea. We ought to have made a record run. Had first of a course of lectures with the Battery headquarters staff under Lieut Neylan. Think it is going to be very interesting work but there is going to be plenty of it.\n\nMeasles broke out on board the ship. Everybody is rousing a treat as it blocks our chance of getting ashore at Durban.\n","97":"\nFine & warmer than it has been in weeks and very calm. I had my first lesson at signaling with the headquarters staff. I can send all right but find it very hard to read, but it will come with practice I suppose. There was a concert at night given by A.M.C fellows. I believe it was not up to much. I was not there. Bill Hunter & Self had a hot water (fresh) bath in a bucket. It was great too.\n\n\n","98":"\nRaining like hell most of the day, and fairly cold; but one can feel it getting warmer every day now as we get closer to land. I was mess orderly for the day and its a rotten job. I had to stay down below all day, so I read most of the time. I finished John Oxenhams book \"Rising Fortunes\" Its not a bad book but not up to his others. I slept up on deck last night and it was a wild night too. I nearly got blown away a couple of times.\n","99":"\nFine & fairly sunny but a strong head wind. We saw more sun than we have seen since we left Australia. The sea too looks a lighter green as if the water was a lot shallower. We had a full dress parade in the morning; and I found the rats had been at my tunic and eaten greatpieces out of it. We went on duty in evening.I was on bosuns fatigue so did nothing tonight.\n","100":"\nA beautiful calm warm day. The first decent day we have had, I was on bosuns fatigue ie swabbing decks, but Bill Hunter & Self were not wanted so we lay in sun all day.We are due at Durban tomorrow & there is great speculation as to our Chances of getting ashore. Had a life belt parade in afternoon. Our brigade were ready in about 8 minutes but I got up in 1 minute & I bet I halve that if a torpedo hits us. Went to bed full of expectations as to our landing at Durban.\n","101":"\nA beautiful fine warm day and land at last. We sighted it about 11 amand we steamed into Durban and moored on South side of the river (Berea) about 1 pm. We got shore leave from about 3 pm till 10.30 pm. Warren Hunters & Self had tea at the Royal Hotel and then we met Harry Truman in a car and went all over the place with him. Went round the beach (Marine Parade) & had tea again there, then went round the Berea and out to Umgeni about 5 miles out and had some soft drinks The bars are not allowed to serve anybody in uniform with any intoxicating liquors at all, and its about the best thing that could be done, pity they would not do it in Australia.\n\nTo March17th\n","102":"\nAnother beautiful day. We turned out for Church parade at eight oclock and after fooling round for a couple of hours we marched through the town about 1¾ miles to the town hall and had service in the hall. After service we were dissmissed till 10.30 pm The same lot of us had dinner at Butterworths and then went out in a car to a sugar refinary & went all over it. It was very interesting. Went to the Zoo afterwards & had tea & a look round the animals.Saw a dingo, kangaroos emus jackasses ect & thought we were home for a bit. Drove round the beach & then up to Butterworths for tea\n\ncont. March19\n","103":"\nIt came up very windy and a roughish sea. We left Durban at 8 amand after dropping the pilot turned south. They say we call in at Capetown anyway I hope we do. There were a few girls down to see us off but not many.It got very windy & some fair waves towards afternoon.One broke the bridge in bow of the ship and washed the big rope down. Not many sick but a few went out to it. It was pretty choppy about mid-day, the bridge in front of the ship got broken again in evening We can see lava most of way round I hear.\n","104":"\nA fine warm day & not much wind. It was great lying in sun out of the wind. MrNeylan\nd\ngave the headquarters staff a lecture in morning and Tom Reed & self did some buzzer work.We had a lecture from Capt Samson (Doctor) on venereal diseases gonorhea & syphlis. He gave us a very good lecture indeed. Passed a mob ofgulls diving at a school of fish. They were in millions and lots of poiposes. It came up very windy again at night.\n\n8.6.16\nGrand Hotel, Cape Town\n\nMenu\n\n4D\n\nW.W.Nisbett.\nK G Binnie\nWarren Hogarth\nH C Slade\nJ A Hunter\nTruman\nW L Hunter\nJohn L Keep.\n","105":"\nA fair cow of a day. A cold gale & spray flying all over the ship. We are out of sight of land except for about half an hour in the evening. Had some buzzer work in morning and lecture from MrNeylan on signaling. Had flag practice in the afternoon on the troop deck. I made arrangements to have 5\/- worth buns brought up to me every day. But found it was too much so got half. We were to pass the place where the \"Birkenhead\" went down (Danger Point) early in evening but owing to a head sea & gale we did not pass till midnight so did not see the place.\n","106":"\nA rotten cold showery & misty day. And Cape Town at last. We sighted land early & got into berth about 9 am.After fooling us about for a couple of hours we got onto the wharf where we were fooled about again for an hour. Then we had to get into parties€” like Cook's tourists each under an N.C.O. We had the usual one with Warren Hogarth in charge. We looked round the town & bought a few things before dinner & then we all had dinner at \"Cleghorns\" Grand Hotel After dinner we got a car and went round the suburbs and up onto the shoulder of the \"Devils Peak\" & we had a great view of Cape Town. We had afternoon tea then & went back to the boat. The bars were\n\nto 20thMarch\n","107":"\nAnother cold bleak rainy day. About the coldest since we left Sydney. We drew out from the wharf about 9 amand anchored out in Table Bay. We then carried on as if we were at Sea. Headquarters staff had a buzzer lecture in morning and flag practise in afternoon. I was a mess orderly for the day. Its rotten being able to see land so close & being unable to get ashore. We may be here for some days, waiting for other transports and an escort to take us to England.\n","108":"\nAnother rotten cold bleak day. We are still lying out in Table Bay. The Colonel went ashore and tried to arrange for boats to get us ashore tomorrow but could not get them, however he says he will try to get them for Monday. Lieut General Thomson came aboard and inspected us or rather the boat in the morning. The \"Benalla\" (an Australian transport) with Carmichaels Miners on board came in in morning & they had a rout march through the town. They left Sydney 11 days before we did & went to Colombo first. The 27thBattery went on duty at 6 pm. I was on guard. We worked the guard 4 hours on & 8 off and its much better than the old way of 2 on & 4 off.\n","109":"\nA rotten cold rainy windy day. About the coldest we have had. We have not seen the sun since we came here and the mist has been over Table Mountain all the time except half an hour. There was a \"Little Penguin\" along side the boat all the morning diving & swimming about. Another transport came in this morning. There was to be a church parade in memory of Lord Kitchener, but the weather stopped it. Came off guard at 6 oclock and was jolly glad to be relieved as I was nearly frozen to death.\n\nIgnorance cost more than education\n.\n","110":"\nA fair day but a bit cool & there were a few showers. They started coaling from lighters in morning & were at it all day. They coaled with niggers & there were some cases amongst them. We gave them some roast beef & put a lot of cayenne pepper in it, they eat it all and some minutes after they began to rub their bellies as the pepper was burning them. We went for a row in one of the ships boats in the afternoon. We went round the \"Benalla\" with the 35th\/ NE & some AMC men on her and round the pier & back to the ship. It was a great change. Everybody very excited as there is a roumer we go ashore tomorrow.\n","111":"\nVery misty in morning but when it lifted it was a perfect day. We (27thBat) all went ashore, the rest of the brigade it was optional whether they went or not, but a lot went. They were all in full marching order except for overcoats. We were taken off about 10.30 amin a lighter & a tug (Sir Charles Elliott). We got ashore about 11 am& the brigade marched out to Sea Point about 2 miles out, and they were dissmissed at 1 pm till 3.45 when they had to be out at the wharf. Bill Hunter & self & Farrier Seagent Armstrong (Bea'shusband) got off as soon as we landed to get some neatsfoot oil. We got it easily & went to the Grand Hotel grill room & had lunch then went out to Cecil Rhodes old home. Its a beautiful\n\nto March 22\n","112":"\nA murky dull day but as there was no wind it was not too cold. The 9thBrigade & a few of our fellows went ashore in morning for a route march. I had a buzzer lecture in morning, and MrNeylan set up a helio for us but we got no practice with it. A lot of the fellows went our for a row in afternoon the rest had a tug of war on the promenade deck. Sent a cable to Linda & asked her to reply so ought to get an answer tomorrow. The 9thplayed allhell on shore & most of them came back drunk & lots did not come back at all.\n","113":"\nA fairly decent day. Some of the officers got ashore but none of the men. I did not get an answer to my cable but may get one tomorrow. Had a physical drill parade in morning after our full marching order parade. And had a lecture on harness from Searg. Armstrong in afternoon. The roumer going round that we leave in morning, so wrote & posted a couple of letters (Linda & Mother). They got most of the 9thBrigade on board at last.\n","114":"\nA fine warm day. The HMS \"Kent\" steamed up firstat sunrise & the band on the \"Marathon\" played the National Anthem. It looked all right, the 4 transports lying round the warship & Table Mountain for a background. We weighedanchor about 11 amand the \"Kent\" leading we steamed off two abreast the \"Benalla\" & \"Beltana\" in front half a mile apart and the \"Argyllshire\" and \"Marathon\" a mile behind them. We are to keep that order I believe. I got a cable from Father today \"Had good rains Love\" and a note from the company to say that there was a cable waiting for me at the Post Office, Linda's I suppose. The fools ought to have had enough sense to send\n\nto March 24th\n","115":"\nAnother cow of a day. Bitterly cold and a fair swell which made the old ship roll a treat. A lot of the men sick. We could see the rest of our convoy away ahead, we lost three or four miles at night but gained it again at night. Had a buzzer lecture in morning and we amused ourselves as best we could in the afternoon. Most of us were looking for a warm place.\n\nNo man is freewho is not master of himself.\n","116":"\nA decent warm day at last. We had no parade at all.The chaplain being very sick there was nobody to take the church service. We sat in the sun & read all day. The convoy have all got into their proper places again. The first instalment of the \"Yandoo\" the 7thBrigade newspaper came out at 3dper copy. It was not at all bad.\n","117":"\nA fine warm day. Its just great to get into some warm weather again. With the exception of our two days in Durban its the first time I have felt properly warm since leaving Sydney. We got our kit bags up from the hold in the morning and stacked them on our troop deck. Lay in the sun in the afternoon after about five minutes physical culture.\n","118":"\nA fine warm day again.We were issued with our black kit bags for an hour in the morning. I put a lot of things out of my sea kit in to the black one & gave it back. We had a little physical culture in the morning under MrNeylan. Bill Hunter & Self were down no 6 hold in afternoon looking for some harness. Something happened to the \"Marathon\" as she dropped right behind.They say she lost a propellar blade but I dont think thats the case. There is a wireless going round that we are going to Marseilles & I think there is a lot of truth in it myself.\n","119":"\nA cloudy day, but very warm & muggy. The 27th Bat was on duty and I was detailed off in the \"ship's stores\" fatigue. Bill Hunter & Self were down the hold getting things out, & sending them up in the sling. Had to go into the cold storage room & get meat out.\n\nThe A8 had a couple of shots with her gun at a cask at 1100 yards range & got 2 hits. HMS Kent had about 50 or more shots at targets astern of her & did some fair shooting Was watching her through the glasses. We were all paid 15\/- in the afternoon. The \"Marathon\" caught us up again in the afternoon after being some miles behind for a couple of days.\n\nDays run to 12 pm\n\n280 miles\n","120":"\nAnother muggy day. We had our full dress parade in morning; or rather a full dress farce, as we get into full marching order and kit at our tables for about 5 minutes & then get into fatigue dress again. Had a lecture on Semaphore signalling before dinner from Mr Neylan. Had a buzzer practice in the afternoon for a little time.\n","121":"\nAnother muggy day. It was our washing day, so we had no parade in the morning and as washing was not dry by dinner time we had none in afternoon either. I practised semaphore signalling in the morning and read all afternoon. The \"Kent\" was away out on the port side all morning turning & twisting about as if she was looking for something. We were pulled up for half an hour in the evening, but it may have been to let the \"Marathon\" catch up as she had fallen behind again.\n","122":"\nA beautiful warm calm day & the sea as smooth as a mill pond. We had a buzzer lecture in the morning and we had a concert in the afternoon. The concert was very good. It was great to look at the great Crowd of men huddled up together all as happy as \"sandboys\" and the sun shining on the sea in the background & never knowing what minute we may be sunk by a torpedo. I often wonder when I see the men gathered together like that how many will come back whole.\n","123":"\nA nice warm day again. Bill Hunter & Self were mess orderlies for the day, so we were not at the Church parade held in the morning. The battery went on \nduty\n guard at 4 pm. There are 63 men on guard now besides 3 Officers 6 Sergeants & 9 corporals & 10 orderlies. We went on in drill order with life belts on and bandoliers & water bottles (filled) over the life belts. You feel like a sausage when you have it on. I was on the first relief & had a good post (No 7).\n","124":"\nA warm & muggy day & we felt it a lot more having all the guard rig out on, as we have to wear our life belts all the time we are on duty. The 28th Battery relieved us at 4 pm. I had a good hot bath in a greasy bucket with greasy water in it, but we dont bother about trifles like grease nowadays & felt much better & cleaner after it. Went down B deck after tea & had our usual game of 500, Bill & Self played Eric Mackellar and Corporal Peach of the 26th Bat. The guard had rifle practice at tins thrown over the back of boat during the afternoon & we did not do too badly.\n","125":"\nA warm day, but it rained most of the day, & blew very hard. We had a lecture on \"Notes from the front\" and the fuze of a shell in the morning. Mr Raymond lectured us. Had no lecture in afternoon but I had a little buzzer practice. The A8 was a long way behind the other boats.\n","126":"\nAnother rainy day. It cleared up a bit in evening. We saw the most gorgeous sunset I ever saw. I have seen grander ones but never one with so many colours before. We had the King's regulations relating to punishments on active service read to us by Capt Campbell in the morning and no parade in afternoon. The whole convoy running up together in evening & they say we get to Dakka in morning & we may be staying till Sunday.\n","127":"\nA very fine hot day. We sighted land early in morning and got opposite Dakar about 9 am. The five boats formed line ahead (Kent, Beltana, Argyllshire Benalla & Marathon) and steamed up to the anchorage. We went right into the harbour to take on water. Dakar is a godforsaken hole but rather a pretty place from the harbour €” which is just a bay enclosed with a breakwater. The houses are all white & with red tile roofs and all Moorish style. The niggers (Senegalese) come out in small canoes & dive for pennies like the Congalese at Colombo, only they are not as good divers. They took our 12 pounder gun off the stern & put a 4.7 one on instead. H.M.S. Swiftsure (sister ship to the Triumph)\n\nto March 25th\n","128":"\nA cool day, owing to a nice breeze. We went into the harbour again about 10 oclock and took on a couple of hundred tons of coal. Was on duty - troop deck picket - all day. It was washing day so we had no parades. The HMS Kent made off about 6.30 pm and then the HMS Swiftsure got moving and we all filed out after them, the A8 leaving Dakar harbour about 7 pm just at dusk. It is very fresh at sea, but everybody glad to get moving again & nobody anxious to see Dakar again.\n","129":"\nA cool windy day, but a calm sea. We were out of sight of land when day broke. Bill Hunter & Self were mess orderlies and the Battery was on duty. Orders came out that everybody was to continually wear their life belts and water bottles (filled) and on the alarm being given to fall in on our own parade grounds and await orders. We had two alarms during the day & everybody got to their places fairly quickly. There were the boxing heats in the afternoon and we shot off some shooting contests with air guns on the officers deck. The 27th Bat A team tied with the Officers team for first place.\n","130":"\nA cold gale blowing, but fairly warm in the sun out of the wind. We had a church parade in the morning in fatigue dress, with our life belts & water bottles on; and a Submarine alarm afterwards. Everybody was in place in nine minutes. Lay in the sun on top of the hatch all afternoon. They called for volunteers for a permanent guard in morning but did not volunteer as the guard will be last off the ship, and will have no opportunitiy of getting & looking after their gear in England.\n","131":"\nA cold wind blowing all day & a shower or two of rain at night. They had a couple of practise shots with the 4.7 in the stern. We had some Semaphore signalling in morning & none of us got on too well. Had some buzzer work in the afternoon.\n\nLook up and not down,\nLook forward & not back,\nLook out & not in €” and\nLend a hand.\n","132":"\nA warm day. I was a mess orderly, Bill Hunter was sick so did not come on with me. The Swiftsure had some life boat practise & lowered a boat in morning & picked it up steaming along. We had a couple of alarms during day. The latest roumer is that we get a couple of destroyers each tomorrow & each go like hell on her own.\n","133":"\nFine & warm. I went on mess orderly again today & then I am finished for the trip. We sighted a derelict this morning and the Swiftsure went over and sank it. It was a little sailing ketch. Had the semi finals of the boxing in the afternoons. Wrote a few letters afternoon. Billy Hunter feeling a lot better.\n","134":"\nA nice warm day, but it came onto rain late at night & washed us all down from upstairs A big Greek boat came through our lines early in morning & made off towards the East. We had a full dress parade in the morning and then we had to set to and clean all our gear brass studs ect in afternoon. They say they sighted some destroyers from the bridge about 3 pm and they are keeping just in front of us. Billy Hunter very crook indeed think it is a tutch of malaria. Heard the \"Marmora\" had been sunk in Bay of Biscay just ahead of us, but it is not confirmed yet.\n","135":"\nFine some of the morning but rain & mist in afternoon & very cold. We had to clean up all our brass work & equipment in morning & do any washing we wanted done. A couple of the guard were sick and I took mess orderly for our part of it for the mid-day meal. We read all afternoon the finals for the boxing were to be held this afternoon, but owing to the wind they were postponed.\n","136":"\nFine & sunny but very cold in morning & evening. We sighted three torpeado boats in morning early & they came up full speed & each took a boat under its care at once and the \"Swiftsure\" went back. As soon as we got our torpedo boat each we each went as hard as we could The \"Marathon\" went straight to the front and stayed there then the \"Benalla\" then us & the \"Beltana\" last. We had a full dress parade in morning and the final of the boxing in afternoon, there were no good spars. Had a concert after the boxing but it was no good. They took collections for a few of the crew who had done little things for us & got a good amount for them. Expect to get to England tomorrow afternoon.\n\n\n","137":"\nFine & warm. Ourdestroyer still zig zagging about in front of us. We saw lots of whales in morning. Had a church parade in morning.We sighted land at 9.30 amand there was great excitement at seeing \"the promised land\" at last. We steamed into Plymouth harbour and dropped anchor at 4.10 pm in the aftenoon. We found all the other ships in before us.The men from them disembarked in evening but we did not. Capt. Chicken distributed the prizes won in sports on board; and we presented him with an address, also the Chief Officer. It made one feel , coming up the coast to think of all the history of the place and all the great men who sailed those waters & the deeds they did. And now in the World's greatest war, to see ships of all sizes & of all nations sailing about as usual Could you have a greater tribute to Great Britain's sea power, I doubt it.\n","138":"\nFine & showery by turns. We were taken off the \"Argyllshire\" at 9.15 amby the tug \"Sir Walter Raleigh\" & landed at the London & South Western Railway Company's station where we were put straight into a train & taken to camp at Amesbury, a part of Salisbury Plains. We got out of train at 4.15 pm and marched about 4 miles to camp. We were all glad to get off the old A8 although she had been a good home to us for 60 days. Capt Chicken shook hands with everybody as they left the ship. The journey up was very interesting to all, the prettiest journey I have ever had. All the country looked beautiful. We did not enjoy the march out so much as we were very tired The camp is a model though. Huts about 60 ft by 20 & beautifully built and only thirty men in each Picture shows, hot & cold showers post office ect\n","139":"\nA cold miserable day. We were dismissed & spent the day cleaning up our lines ect. Had some kicks about with the football in afternoon & then the Battery went on duty. I was amongst those picked out for main guard.\n","140":"\nFine in morning but raining in afternoon. On guard all day. Got off about 4.30 pm. We had an inspection of huts & were issued with pillows\nmattresses\n€‹& pillowslips, also sleeping boards. They made some unholy regulations about keeping our clothes in certain places also. Sent a cable home. Came off guard & then stayed about the camp.\n","141":"\nCold & dull all day. The headquarters staff all went out to Stonehenge for a walk. It is marvellous how the people who built it in days gone bye got the stones there & put them up. It would be a fair job now with all our cranes ect. Had some more practise with flags in afternoon. Bill Hunter, Self Warren, Bill Nesbitt, & Tom Reed got a car & went into Salisbury for tea. We had dinner at the \"Cathedral Hotel\" and had a look round the town & cathedral, but the Cathedral was closed & we could only see the outside\n","142":"\nA fairly warm day, but cloudy. MrNeylan gave us flag drill in morning & we cleaned up our huts for an inspection in afternoon. Andy Fisher & the Lord Mayor of London were coming out but they never turned up. We got our first mail in the evening and it was great to hear from home. I got letters from Linda & Jo. It was the third letter from Linda, but they say that there are more to come shortly so I dare say the first & second will be amongst them.\n","143":"\nA warm day for this part of the world, but we were glad to wear our tunics. Had some flag drill with MrNeylan in morning. The battery went on duty in afternoon, and as I was not on^dutyI went down to Bournemouth with Bill Richards, Dick Capel & Harry Camp in a car. We had one of the prettiest drives I have ever had. We had dinner at the \"Bath & East Cliff\" hotel, & came back after. My word the officers did look when we common gunners walked into their inner sanctum.\n\nPoor Billy Hunter got bad news, he heard his brother Clive had been killed in France. I hope its not true. I had a letter from Linda the 2nd\nfirst\n€‹she has written, but none from father.\n","144":"\nA dull misty day. I was a mess orderly with Bill Hunter for the day. I was on a fatigue cleaning up the cookhouse all the afternoon. I wrote to Jo, Father and Linda in the afternoon.\n","145":"\nA warm day but very dull. Capt Campbell took some of us down to watch the heavy artillary firing There were three batteries of 60 pounders practising Was on fatigue in the stables in afternoon, carting dirt to them. I got two parcels in afternoon from Linda, a tobacco pouch & my ring. They are both beauties and I just wanted that pouch. I heard from Mother. She is taking a room in London for a bit.\n","146":"\nA decent warm day at last. MrNeylan had us for flag drill in morning & we were working the helio-graph in afternoon. It is interesting work in the open like this. I received a paper (Sunday Times) from Linda and a letter from Alan from Scotland. Had a game of Cricket and some kicks at the football in evening.\n\nHere's to the man who plans things€”\nBuilds things€” makes things€”\nWho prates not of wonders of old;\nNor gloats onancestral gold,\nBut takes off his coat & takes a hold,\nAnd does things.\n","147":"\nA beautiful warm day, the best since leaving Australia about. I was on duty cleaning up lines & sweeping out the Seargents room all day. I went down & had a bit of signaling in afternoon. Kicking the football about all evening.\n","148":"\nAnother nice warm day. Helio signalling all day. I got a couple of letters from Mother to say she would come down to Salisbury if I wanted her too, but as I get leave on Monday I \ndid not as\n wired her not to come. The 27thBattery went on duty. I was detailed as incinerator man.\n","149":"\nA beautiful warm day. About 70 of the Battery went on leave. The leave is badly managed as you only get four days including traveling to & from camp & it does not matter where you are going you have to go up to London first. I was an incinerator man for the day it is a good job. Got a cable from Linda to say all well.\n","150":"1916\nA nice warm day. The place seems deserted with all the fellows on leave. I was on cleaners fatigue, had to clean out the Sergeants hut. Had a game of cricket in afternoon. Got a letter from Mother to say she would wait for me at the Hotel.\n","151":"\nA nice warm day. Had a church parade in morning & fell out with the Presberterian & other Protestant denominations & went to the YMCA hut. It was very like a salvation army meeting outside a pub. A couple of fellows from Mooki came up in afternoon & had a yarn. Polishing up to go to London tomorrow.\n","152":"\nFine but dull. We got away from camp about 8.45 & marched to Amesbury & got a special train for Warterloo. We got there about 12.30 & marched to the Australian Military Offices in Horseferry Road. After fooling about there for a bit we were dismissed and I got a taxi & came straight to the Goring Hotel.Mother was waiting for me & it was good to see her again. Alan came in later in his uniform. Both look very well.We went round the town a bit & saw Jack Bridges & Uncle Bertie (who is to be married tomorrow) Auntie Florence, MrsAngus, Miss Robertson.Mother Alan & I went to see MrManhattan at Prince of Wales Theatre.

The Bishop of Salisbury was preaching & he gave us a very decent little sermon & we could hear all he said, which is more than can be said for most church parades. Bill & Jack Hunter & Warren Hogarth & Self got a car & went into Salisbury for dinner. We expected to meet Mother but she did not turn up. Had lunch at the CountyHotel. We saw Capt & MrsChicken there & had a long yarn. Walked round town afterwards & went all over the Cathedral. It is a wonderful place inside & quite the most beautiful I have ever seen.

He says they are working them very hard over there, but they are learning something\n","163":"\nFine & warm. I did a bit of signalling in morning but as there were only three of us, we could not get much practice so we had some practice atsetting up the helio & taking it down.

The battery\ngoes\nwent on duty at 6 pm but I am exempt from all duties being a signaller so did not get anything to do. I finished \"Aunt Sarah & the War\" & I liked it very much. There is a lot of sound common sense in it. I would give anything to be able to write letters ect like the ones Owen Tudor wrote.\n\nCampbell told me we would be in the firing line in eight weeks. Just see how true this prophesy is.\n","171":"\nWarm & close. It cameon to sprinkle in the morning the first rain since we landed in England 34 days ago.

Out with the signallers all day, but it was too wet for a lamp parade at night. All the boys came back from Winchester at dinner time. They learnt nothing down there. In fact I think we learnt more here. Anyway I hope we settle down & learn something now. Posted my & letters to Linda & Father & Jo.\n","195":"\nFine & the sun shining most of the day, but it has not any power behind it. Out signalling all day with the signalling school & we had a lamp parade at night. I got two letters from Linda, one from Eileen& one from MrsLLoyd.

It was too late to go out when we had finished. Things have all gone wrong today. First we were told that we were not getting away till November which was enough to turn us all wild, as we are all sick of this hole, then nothing to eat for tea but dry bread & then old Warren is being transfered to the 23rdBrigade. Its rotten being separated from our mates like that & Warren was the best mate a man could wish for. Any way we are trying all ways to get together again somewhere &any how.\n\nFriday 8 September 1916\nFine & warm. I went up to the dentist at Larkhill No 10 camp in morning to get a tooth stopped. It turned out the dentist (Lieut Tonkin I think) came home on the same boat as mother & father a few years ago. Poss Nivison arrived & was put into the 27thBattery.

Out with battery headquarters all day, as a telephonist. Its not much of a job as thereis nothing to do. Got letters from Linda, Father & Jo. We played the 26thBattery 2ndteam & beat them by 9 to 8, after a hard even game. I enjoyed the game very much.\n","202":"\nFine. Went up to the dentist in morning, but have to go back again on Friday. Out with the rangetakers ect in afternoon. We all had to attend a lecture by a Salvation Army Colonel in evening & it was a a big farce. Poss Nivison & Self went up to the pictures after.

Poss & self went up to Larkhill afterwards & I got a letter from father & also a draft of£25 from Uncle Richard. We went to the \"Maple Leaf\" pictures ect afterwards & they were not too bad.

But the thing broke down half way to Salisbury & we had to get another car. Got up to London about 4 pm and picked up Alan & Ike Moses & John Wilkinson & a lot more.

Revielle at 5.30 and we all paraded in marching order and marched over to Bulford where we joined up with the rest of the 3rdDivision. A lot of the artillary was mounted with their guns (18 pounders & howitzers). It was a fine sight to see all the mounted artillary & infantry with fixed bayonets marching past and a few aeroplanes over-head flying about. We got back to camp some time after 7 pm a very tired but happy lot. Got a letter from M€‹rLLoyd dated 23rdAug.\n","215":"\nStarted to rain about mid-day & went on till evening. We got to Bulford about 10 amand King George inspected us (the 3rdDivision) & then we marched passed him & the","216":"Battery was very good the best in the division they say. Anyway the officers were pleased with us & we were pleased with ourselves. King George has aged very much since I saw him four years ago in India. The rain spoilt the show from a spectacular point of view, but even so it must have been great. Got a letter from Linda in answer to my letters from England. Am so glad she seems to be getting strong again, & seems very happy. It makes all the difference in the world to know she is all right & happy.\n","217":"\nFine & warm.

Out with the signallers all day. The battery was on duty. I heard that I was recommended for a commission with Poss Nivison & I dont want the bally star, but I think that its up to me to take it if it comes my way. My idea was to go through this war in the ranks with the men & to get to know them all personally as it may come in very handy in after life. I have refused stripes a couple of times for that reason. Anyway its not official yet, so why worry over it. Got a letter from Linda 20\/8\/16.\n","223":"\nRaining a lot of the day. Out with the signallers all day.
