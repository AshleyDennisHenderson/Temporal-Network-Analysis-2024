cold day. Issued with 2 Gas Helmets per man – also had a lot Gas drill, had to have our helmets on within 10 seconds, it means more bulk to carry. Went for a march thro Hazebruck in the afternoon – Good news of progress along all our lines still comes in - Notice a lot of observation balloons up – great bombarding going on all day. Some of the German trenches they say are 25 feet deep.\n\nAttend the Village Church every evening possible for the Rosary. The Boys are spending money very freely in the village & naturally everybody says we are jolly good fellows.\n","2":"\n\nRaining nearly all day – roads very sloppy. Marched out (2 Battalions of the 5th Division) through Morabecque to a field near the trenches – here we were lined up & a gas cloud was liberated & we had to go through it – followed almost by an explosion of tear shells which are very severe on the eyes & bring tears otherwise nobody suffered any casualties. Had read\n\nout on Parade, the names of the men who had been shot after trial by court martial – Discipline at present is very strict – Our arms just ache from saluting & they crime any of us for not saluting properly.\n\nDr or Captain Mc Kenzie of the 8th Field Ambulance yesterday while at his First Aid post, went outside to have a look at the bombardment & he was immediately blown to pieces. \n\nMyself & 3 other boys celebrated our pay by having a bottle of Champagne costing 5\/- each.\n","3":"\n\nRather hot & fine – Got marching orders at 7 am to clean billet & march off with Brigade at 11.30 am. Finish Steenbecque – Marched about 16 miles towards Armentieres – went through 2 fine towns of Merville & Estaires, halted a couple of miles after going thro Estaires & billeted in a Barn, had short\n\nrations & could buy very little. The march from an Ambulance point of view was disgraceful & reflects badly on the leader General Elliott – my estimate of men who fell out was 25 per cent & others say 600 men fell out along the whole line. We could only handle the most serious cases – there were sprained ankles chafes – men fainting & the worst trouble bad fitting boots. If only a very few of the many curses (dinkum Australian) hurled at the General work out, his lot will not be a happy one. We were supposed to get 10 minutes rest every hour – he marched us for 3 hours & gave us an hour, we all got cold & stiff – he then went back looking for his men & found them laying 4 deep in some places. General McKay & other generals inspected as we marched in & if McKay has any good judgement, he must surely have noticed company's missing & how tired & fagged we all were. We rolled in clothes & all & had a jolly good sleep in the Hay among Fowls & they started crowing about 3 am.\n\nAeroplanes – Observation Balloons & heavy artillery firing is the order hereabouts. Australians of all ranks and Divisions are to be found in Estaires.\n","4":"\n\nFine & hot. Moved out from billet back thro Esraires, picked up rest of Brigade in the square – Marched some 6 miles thro the Village of Sailly – got into a billet – a big Farm Barn on the outskirts – On the way we witnessed many air duels at times right over our heads – our guns were firing at them all around us – Some of the Boys started a very appropriate song – I want to go back – We are now 4 miles from our first line & well in the range. Heavy firing going on all night, the star shells looked very pretty, but terrifying. It is marvellous how one can adapt themselves, our billet may be next to be shelled & yet we are quite indifferent – Very cold during night.\n","5":"\n\nThe German aircraft yesterday must have observed us march in – because at daylight they started dropping shells at about a minutes interval\n\non the Town of La Vinte, where the 59th & our artillery are billeted, it is only ¼ of a mile in front of us. 3 stretcher Bearer squads from each section moved out to the trenches at V C Cutting. A woman in the Village had collar bone broken by anti air guns & came to our Station to be dressed – Sailly show signs of the Huns unfortunately – A Great number of the inhabitants are still in the Village at their own risk. We took over operations from the 13th F. Ambulance today, they are due at Ypres – Had to tear the Cross & Brassard off our arms – so we have no protection at all. I for one will shoulder a rifle straight away, if the Geneva Convention cannot give better protection. Men are wounded in the trenches here in the morning & at sunset they are on the way to London – Some very stirring air duels immediately near us – Immediately our planes get near their lines for observation purposes they open fire & can safely say they fire hundreds of shells at each plane & there are dozens of planes & yet they say the Germans are short of ammunition, most of the shootings is rotten.\n\nMonday\n\nAttended a sergeant from 51st D'A'C with both hands nearly blown off, just like pieces of raw meat – also had abdomenal wounds & face wounds – sent him on to the big Hospitals.\n","6":"\n\nVery cold last night – 15th F. Ambulance & Dr Coppleson done good work last night. Most of the bearing has to be done under darkness & difficultys, as long as we get them into the dressing station, we can evacuate them during the day, we only hold men here who will be fit for service again in five days – 128 shells were dropped into Lavinte yesterday & the only damage was Batterys nil – 1 cow & calf injured, two Farm houses blown down & burnt – I could have got plenty of souvenirs – but a man would soon want a horse to carry them.\n","7":"\n\nRaw cold sort of day – Very busy all night & day – The 57th Battallion are getting hell in the trenches. It's hard to see our lads & lots that we know, coming in at mid\n\nnight, all wet & covered in mud from the trenches. One fellow who had his cheek nearly blown away, but very cheery, said how long will it take before I'm at them again – this is a nice Souvenir, just 12 months married today. 3 other lads unconscious from Gas. One fellow was shot in the groin by a snipper – said just going on Guard when the blighter got me. Took a walk while slack about midnight & followed the horse shoe of the trenches by the flash of the star shells & guns – it is hard to realize what war in reality is – but when you are forced to believe that your turn may be next, it is almost nerve wrecking – Some of the wounds nearly turned me up & it proves that a man can stand a devil of a lot of the Huns. The Boys that fell were buried quietly nearby. At our Billet in the Village in the backyard along with others lies Pte S H Schroeder – 9th Battalion 3rd Brigade A.I.F.\n","8":"\n\nVery cold day – A Party of us took rations to our lads in the trenches – The Boys still coming in freely, all slight clean cases today.\n","9":"\n\nRaining off & on – very cold. In charge of the Hospital pantry, can get this job permanently & probably 2 stripes – no good to me as I am prepared to go to the trenches & stay there as long as boys stay there. Went for a walk around Laventie – it is a fine Town, but now mostly ruins – got postcards of the Cathedral & got a little piece of stained glass as a Souvenir.\n\nBombardment not so heavy today – About 12 wounded came in today. In our tobacco issue today I got a p' c enclosed from Miss E. A. Healy – c\/o Telephone Exchange, Brisbane, also Miss W Fihilly same address. I was quite pleased & hope it is the Eileen Healy, that has given us many a good musical evening. I am returning both p'c's.\n\n15\/5\/16 Saturday\n\nRaining & dull – Very busy at the Clearing Station – hardly time to have meals. It is just like murder to see our fine lads coming in so helpless, & knocked about – covered with mud & blood, - for a while it used to upset\n\nme but that did the lads no good when one has to act promptly or not at all. Generally speaking they are splendid patients, as they do not all get chloroform, to get their arterys tied & limbs set etc. – the worst feature I think is probing for shrapnel. One of our stretcher bearers got hit with a shell today – poor fellow fine patient – not a murmur, broken arm – 6 wounds of shrapnel & a 3 inch wound in the small of the back, right through the spine – I am sure he will never get off his back. Poor Pte Pryce of the 57th – who was in great agony died in our arms, as soon as we lifted him off the Ambulance Car, He was shot in the back. We expect some big movement hereabouts at an early date, a lot of troops & artillery moving towards Lille. The French Interpreter who is attached to the 15 F. Ambulance happens to be a Priest & is a very nice\n\nfellow. I went to Confession as opportunity offered.\n","10":"\n\nWent to Mass at 6 am at the Church opposite our Dressing Station – Our Interpreter said Mass. No sleep last night, going as hard as we could, with 2 Doctors – Before going to Mass we had a lull & then started afresh, by 9 am we had handled some 150 Patients, some awful cases, men not recognizable, several cases of noses blown right off, to say nothing of fractures – shock etc. Had two cases of shock in particular who were painful to watch, just a bundle of nerves & ready to cow at the slightest noise.\n\n57th & 58th must have lost heavily last night. The Germans blew our very poor parapets down in several places & treated them to Gas, Aerial Torpedoes – Plum Puddings – Mortars – Shrapnel & the full variety of their stock. Unfortunately the only backing they had was the 15th Artillery with 18 ponders & they took hardly any effect, in fact\n\nit is hard to say, but that our own lads suffered from our own stray shells which dropped short into our own trenches.\n\nBoys who were wounded at Gallipoli, say that last night was hell & Gallipoli was not in it. Got orders about 9.30 am to move out, as our Dressing Station was not safe, owing to roads about to be closed during next few days – Packed up in double time & our section moved our about 12 noon – Left A & B Sections to fix up balance wounded & evacuate them. \n\nMarched about 4 miles towards Armentiers & took possession of a fine big Woolen Factory owned by a German, but now deserted, cleaned up & made preparation to receive 1,000 men if necessary, we may have to hold up to that number & evacuate them first opportunity when roads are open. About 5 pm 14th Field Ambulance blew in to give us a hand, so we expect something big – As I was too busy dressing this morning I missed my turn to go to the trenches. 3 of our Stretcher Bearers missing – 8 pm got word to prepare for heavy casualties.\n","11":"\n\nDull day – Go in about 50 lads last night evacuated them about 10 am. Helping to dress all day – very busy all day the 14th in the next room going strong also. Heavy casualties from","12":" 30th 31st 32nd. One fellow who had stuff falling from a hole in his pocket – I suggested to change to another pocket, here I found a packet of cigarettes with 4 in cut from shrapnel just as tho by a knife also a pipe, pocket book & a tin of Tobacco. Dr. McIntosh asked him to allow him to keep as a souvenir. E. Hand – Jenkins & myself found out in the backyard a hole where 7 Australians were buried, the hole was not even properly closed, so we got to & dressed it and planted some daisys- also left their bruised helmets on top as a mark of respect to our good lads.\n","13":"\n\nRain dull day – Twice last night we got the alarm of a Gas attack – There are plenty of other things more pleasant than waking from a sound sleep & awaiting the effects of gas\n\nThe attacks were a failure owing to a poor wind, it hung about the German trenches & never came over. Had about 40 cases for dressing.\n\n19\/7\/16 Wednesday, Thursday & Friday\n\nAt the Trenches\n - expecting something big this evening – At 1 pm our artillery started – talk about Hell let loose. It is just deafening & a good nerve tester. Shrapnel bursting all around, this is a very mild tho paper form of putting it. We have a dug out near a Battery, where we duck to when it gets too hot. I noticed the Brigade going into the trenches to day, they have a sort of heavy – dull manner, not usually like our Australians – perhaps we all know too well the same number will not return the same road. A Good victory to night will put some more heart & spirit into them, for this I earnestly pray. Some of our F.A. Boys had to go into the first line of trenches as a lot of the Regimental bearers are no more – this is a bit rough on us as we are non combatant & hardly trained for that kind of ordeal – I am quite resigned if I am to go, well, I must hope for one to send me there quickly & no lingering\n\n20\/7\/16 (later) Thursday & Friday\n\n I do not know yet whether I am on my head or heels – but one thing seems to strike me most forcibly – some good friend of mine – must have prayed hard & recently for me. For to have come through safely the last two days & nights – is I take it a good answer to my friends. I really do not know what to say – but just Hell let loose in its worse form. Shrapnel – Shell – Bombs – Bullets. Deafening & Terrifying – When ones nerves are good & not carried away but resigned there is a sort of indescribable fascination, & one thinks I've missed that – but the next may get me. At time of writing 8 pm, a lull. I've had 4 hours sleep out of the 48 hrs – hurried & not too good snacks as opportunity occurred. Every bone & muscle is aching, my back & loins are as tho broken from carrying our good brave lads, nothing was too much trouble for me to do for them, most of our lads were very good, but regret that in our F.A. we had some\n\nshirkers, which made it harder on the willing ones – It was dressing – or carrying through the saps along the trenches as quickly as possible – wounded everywhere, couldn't get them in quick enough – At 2 am Thursday morning at the 32nd Aid Post – things were some hot Fritz was dropping them hard and swift all around, it was just raining shrapnel the Regimental S B's, who without a doubt are as brave as any men in the army, were either shot, fagged out or gone in the nerves. At any rate the wounded were not coming in freely enough (Regimental S Bearers should bring to first aid post & Field Ambulance attend from there on). At 2 am about 8 15th Field Ambulance volunteered to go up to the first line ½ mile away & get them in – tho this was distinctly against our Colonels wishes & orders, we worked from the firing line right thro till the lull about mid day Thursday – by 8 pm on Thursday, we went everywhere & felt quite satisfied, our services were required by no more. From then on we gave our attention to dug outs, here we found\n\nquite a lot who had managed to scramble in with broken arms, legs, etc. Then there was another phase to interest us to get the wounded off no mans land – last night a dozen volunteers went over & got 8 cases – but the Snipers made it too hot so we had to give it up – All day today we can see on to mans land by periscope at least 5 cases of wounded trying to move to give us a signal they are still alive, for these poor devils we are volunteering to go to night & do our utmost – During today we got three fellows by rope etc – first we throw them a water bottle & then drag them in - \nMy mate Harry Ramsden this evening stood up on the parapet & looked over\n - just below him was a huge shell hole & a fellow partly buried, in answer he said he was unhurt, we soon got him over. Also got Cpl Jacobs 32nd shot in the breast, a brave lad too. \nOn Wednesday\n evening at 6 pm\n\nthe 8th 14th & 15th Brigades, after a furious bombardment, climbed the parapet & made a brilliant charge, taking the first – second & 3rd line of German trenches, the second trench was full of mud & water, but the lads went thro in style.\n\nAt 5 am next morning, they were counter attached & outflanked on the left & had to fight their way back, at what cost, perhaps the authoritys know by the number killed, as we do by the number of wounded. All the lads are emphatic on two points and these are, they received no reinforcements on the left, also that our own X &","14":" Divisional Artillery cut them up cruelly, this will probably be enquired into officially. I have evidence of short range shells myself – this little matter greatly disheartened them. The Englishman all say our lads done splendidly, but our Officers were not the best & that our Artillery was rotten.\n\nThey took some 400 prisoners, we treated 5 Germans & 1 Wounded Officer.\n\nDr Copplesom & Dr Minty, I consider deserve special mention for the way they stuck to their post. Lots of the Infantry who used to say Field Ambulance men were cold footed now have a different tale to tell, they said we must have charmed lives. I only got two little scratches from shrapnel - & 4 Bearers were wounded. I consider no men could do justice to ghastly sights behind our parapets yesterday – the Chaos – the dead in different attitudes, the wounded perhaps only distinguished by the moaning – the nerve broken soldier trying to do his duty at his post, with dead all around them – it will be a night mare to me for all times. As near as we can estimate we have since Wednesday midday till Friday midday treated nearly \n3,400\n cases The majority of these were carried in. We hear rumours that the total casualties run to 5,000. One very fine feature of the evacuation of wounded after us dressing them, was a splendid service of \n\nofficial figures later given 8,340 total casualtys \n\nMotor ambulances, we never had to wait a single minute to get them away & I hope the people responsible get every credit.\n\nOur advanced Dressing Station is alongside of where they bury the boys & its heartrending to see the dead waiting to be buried. All our Boys admit & recognize we owe a debt of gratitude to the \nOx & Bucks\n also to a squad of New Zealand Field Ambulance men who gave a willing hand when we were all fagged & weary to get the boys in.\n","15":"\n\nWas on duty with 3 others in the trenches from 8 am till 10 pm but we got no relief & had to stay on till 6 am this morning, our relief couldn't get down to us owing to snipers & machine gun fire across the road & saps. killed 2 men & 3 horses alongside the dressing station – Put in a very cheerful night. I don't think). Dr Minty said I could go & have a good camp all day, so self & 3 others got into a dug out about a mile back & slept like a top till 8 pm. Very few casualties today – Some bearers went out on to no mans land & got 2 men still alive one with bullet in leg – the other shell shock. Pte Hamilton said he had been over & was coming back when they got him, he lay there since\n","16":" am Thursday morning, he dug a hole & got water & had some biscuits in his pockets, poor fellow was in great spirits, will surely lose his leg as it was septic & he had no pain. The Germans shot at the bearers as they were getting back over the parapet. Heavy bombardment all night, also heavy rifle & machine gun fire.\n","17":"\n\nFritz was busy exchanging big uns all day – Got a kick last night about 1 am as a gas attack was on, but it turned out to be smoke. Only the remnants of the","18":" Division holding these lines today. We hear good news of a big advance further along the line (\nPozierres\n), no doubt although our casualties were heavy, we have served the purpose of holding a big lot of\nBoshs \nhere P. Guards thus allowing them Lower down to advance – Poor Tom Dawson who once made Australia laugh at his jokes – bled to death on no mans land. We got a Circular from G.O.C. & A.D.M.S. complimenting us on our very fine work. Aeroplanes busy – also rifles, Trench mortars & machine guns. We are not far from V.C. Avenue, it was here where M. O'Leary won his V.C. Other names of trenches & saps\n\nabout are Cedar Farm – Rifle Villa – Rendezvous – Dead Dog Avenue – Devon Farm Avenue and our Dressing Station is styled Eaton Hall. \n\nGot a pay today of\n40 Francs\n, money is no good to us here.\n","19":"\n\nMachine gun & snipers very busy right through the night, they were just raining it all around Eaton Hall & the road to the saps. Only a few casualties today. At 8.30 am we heard a feint voice over the parapet on no man's land – it was the work of seconds for volunteers to get him, with no misfortunes – his name was (Pte Morris – 32nd from Sydney) poor fellow had a fractured jaw from machine gun also shrapnel rin thigh, he had been out since last Thursday morning, he had nothing to eat or drink since, of course, we showered our very best on him – he deserved a trip. Heavy bombardment all day below us.\n","20":"\n\nGot orders to go to \"Nouveau Monde” for a blow, where our Dressing Station is, having shifted back again from \"Bac Saint Mar”. Will be very pleased to get away for a while\n\nfrom this nerve racking din of war.\n","21":"\n\nAt Dressing Station \"Nouveau Monde” quite a treat to know you are virtually out of harms way. Helping to dress all day – tho things are very quiet. It was as good as a tonic, after coming from the trenches to receive 2 letters, one from G. Hegerty & M. Single.\n","22":"\n\nRaw cold day – very hazy. Got letters from Grace, Mrs O'Kelly & Annie – Had the day to myself, but to be in readiness to proceed anywhere. Got in a few very nasty cases – Heavy bombarding all through the night & today – South of Laventie. One thing that was very noticeable right through the busy times was the \nabsence of N.C.O.'S\nto take any responsibilitys near the firing line, not one can boast of being within 3 miles – There is absolutely no chance whatever of promotion in this Unit.\n","23":"\n\nVery nice day – sunny. Heavy fighting and heavy bombarding on our left at Armentiers. Aeroplanes very busy. At 8 of our planes\n\nthis evening the Bosh's must have fired at least 1,000 shots inside 2 hours; & they all returned.\n","24":"\n\nNice Sunny day. Only a few casualtys in today, mostly shrapnel wounds in the legs – Took a run up to \"Bac St Muir”. Got the loan of some old clothes & a woman in our billet washed my uniform, it was very dirty from gore & trench mud.\n","25":"\n\nVery warm & sunny – Went to 10 am Mass. I tried hard to follow the sermon – but \nnon compre\n – Only got a few casualtys today.\n","26":"\n\nWarm & sunny – Had to shift our advanced dressing Station from Eaton Hall to Croix Blanche, as it was getting too hot. A few cases – mostly from Snipers & accidents. Our aeroplanes doing good work overhead, they seem to have charmed lives as very few of the shots seem to take any effect. Continue to get good reports of the boys down below us at Peronne. At our point South of Armentiers, our lads don't let the Saxons have much sleep.\n","27":"\n\nQuite a hot day, about 98 in the Shade. Received our first lot of Reinforcements to make up wastage. The usual bombarding by heavy Artillery etc. Caught a few spies about our lines.\n","28":"\n\nHot & sunny. Not much doing & very few casualtys – Posted P.C.s to Frank, also letters to Grace, Jack O'Hagan & H.O'Kelly.\n","29":" Friday & Saturday\n\nVery sick – kind of Ptomaine poisoning.\n","30":"\n\nNot feeling too good & never done anything. Still fairly quiet along our trenches.\n","31":"\n\nAltho not feeling too good, I went out to the trenches rather than miss my turn. Heavy Artillery firing all day – The Germans brought down one of our planes quite near Eaton Hall. Renewed Father King's acquaintance, he says he is heartily sick of the whole business, he told me that on the night our lads went\n\nover the parapet, Father Gilbert went with them & was hardly recognizable on return. I saw him during the afternoon but not later. Got nice cheery letter from Gert, Lill & Kithock\n","32":"\n\nAt the trenches – Our Artillery shaking Fritz up all day & night – Some of our lads made a raid on Fritz's trenches & left him a lot of bombs & offered to make contracts with him, to smash up trenches etc at shortest notice – very few casualty's night & day.\n","33":"\n\nI thought our Artillery was teasing Fritz too much & was not surprised to find that he introduced himself about 9 am by shelling our Dressing Station (Croix Blanche). Just at the time as I was very dirty after being up all night, I was trying to have a shave – 2 shells fell about 20 yards from where I was I raised the alarm & had started for a funk hole, when the third came right through & the 4th pretty well levelled it. In all 127 shells were dropped & only 4 duds. Beyond losing everything in the way of medicine, gear, etc, there was\n\nnot a single casualty in the 15th F.A. which once again proves that to date our Ambulance seems to have charmed lives. \nSo\n much for the Huns) & non combatants.\n\nPoor Father King & Dr Coppleson got into a cellar – Father King was badly knocked about, broke his glasses, had his uniform torn, etc, & looked a break up – he is very emphatic in the belief that any man who wanted a second dose of such treatment must be insane. (X(Hay – Spys – Dugouts & Trench Batterys.?) One poor fellow named Smith of the 55th Bat was passing along the road at the time on a Bicycle, Bicycle blown to bits & Smith was blown some 12 yds away – unrecognizable, head almost blown off – Had to make the best of things all day & night.\n","34":" Thursdayday\n\nTrying to make decent places to dress the wounded in safely in all day – it will stand a certain amount of H. E. only, but is bullet & shrapnel proof. Very tired &\n\nfagged out – haven't had a decent sleep for a week, heavy artillery firing etc.\n","35":"\n\nThe usual trench warfare going on, & only a few casualys night & day.\n","36":"\n\nTrying hard to rain – Fritz shelling villages of Laventie - Fleurbaix freely – of no military importance. Altho still running Eton Hall Dressing Station – we were ordered to also relieve the 8th Field Ambulance & take over the First Aid Post below Fleurbaix – no rest for the wicked or willing – Luckily we can handle all at present very conveniently.\n","37":"\n\nWent to Mass & Communion at Nouveaux-Monde 6.30 am. Fritz shelling around \"La Bassee”. Having a blow from the trenches (Late Parade. Crimed but appealed & got off.) \n","38":"\n\nRain off & on all day – Got orders to get back to my dug out at Eaton Hall – Very lively trench warfare, also lively sniping all night.\n\nA Tommy sniped just outside Eaton Hall at 10 am – Only had a few casualtys.\n","39":"\n\nRaining off & on. As our Ambulance was recommended for special notice & one medal was alotted to H. Ramsden today, it is the Military Cross. I have referred to Harry back during the stunt. Forgot to mention the King & Prince of Wales passed thro Sailly – I would know him from his photo antwhere. Put in a wretched night down in saps – only one casualty, but the shrapnel – whiz bang, etc fairly got my nerves. 2 Fellows killed outright.\n","40":"\n\nDull & raining – mud is the order of the day & it is hard work stretcher bearing. My self and Dick Deshorn went up to the firing line about daylight – I had a couple of shots & hope they had good effect. Rumours that the King said we were going to winter in Ireland, etc.\n\nNot much doing all day. Had a letter from Mrs O'Kelly – wrote to May.\n","41":"\n\nDull & raining – not many casualtys. French mortar Batterys very busy stirring up Fritz.\n","42":"\n\nDull & raining – Rather lively trench warfare – had a few calls during the night, the Snipers & Machine guns are cruel the way they play around our dug outs & thro the Cemetery – luckily for us we know the danger spots & try to duck when duty calls us.\n","43":"\n\nDull & raining – motor Battery fellows got hell today – as soon as they start Fritz trains his artillery on them & before they get 6 shots over. We seem to think Fritz has some mechanical contrivance for detecting sound & is ready for them when they start. Poor Capt Jack & Corporal Fisher got badly knocked about. Artillery started strafing Fritz at 10.45 pm – 57th Raided his trenches & were very successful – We had\n\na heavy night carrying thro the mud & slush, the air seemed to be thick with bullets whizzing – As the road is so dangerous our Ambulance Cars cannot venture further down than the Estaminet – result all patients have to be carried 4 miles. Fritz dropping H. E. very close to our Aid Post all night, none of us had any sleep.\n","44":"\n\nDull but no rain – We all went to bed about 5 am after clearing the wounded, about 6.30 am Fritz lobbed over some H. E.; the 2nd one took the cover off our dug out, others riddled our water cart etc – as we have no decent dug outs we all thought we would be in heaven in time for dinner, after about an hours suspense, he never got us & we started business as usual – I don't care who the man is this sort of thing unnerves him more especially, when he gets no sleep, that is our biggest trouble.\n\nMonday \n","45":" 1916 Fixed up the Aid Post as well as we could – Started building a decent dug out – Fairly quiet – not many casualtys\n","46":"\n\nDull & raining – Lively trench warfare – slight casualtys – Snipers very busy with enfilade fire on our roads.\n","47":"\n\nDull & raining – Fairly quiet in the Saps. Fritz very quiet – Got a letter from Jen Hagen & Mrs O'Kelly.\n","48":"\n\nMysely & 5 others were ordered in to \"Nouvea Monde” for a blow as we had the longest spell in the trenches – Will be pleased to toget away from the shells for a while.\n","49":"\n\nDull day – Did a few odd jobs about the Dressing Station – Very few cases from the trenches – Have a lot of Tommys & Scottys with us in the Billets.\n","50":"\n\nVery heavy wind all day – Doing some odd jobs all day – Went up to Bac St Maur in the afternoon.\n","51":"\n\nGot a very rude awakening at 2.30 am & told to be at our posts at 6 am. Some 50 Bearers moved out to various Posts – Myself – Deshon – Woods & Longden, went to Wye Farm – near Bois Greniers Our part of the line had to give some sort of a demonstration, while something big was going on at Armertiers – At 11 am, we got word that the stunt was not coming of as arranged, we had to stay at our posts till 1.30 pm & were then told to get back to Nouveau Monde, I never said a word after carrying stretchers – dressing, sick & tucker for 3 miles – Drizzling & rain all day.\n\n20th Monday\n\nVery nice day. Got orders to go out & relieve bearers at Foray House – Here myself – Page, Bowden & Gurner found a very out, got 3 cases during the night – very heavy artillery firing both sides –","52":" strafed Fritz with bombs for an hour – Plenty of shells coming very freely around our dug out, but beyond stopping our freedom, done no harm.\n","53":"\n\nRaining hard most of the day – Shifted up to \"Convent Avenue”, which are supports, where the Infantry are camped – our dug out measures 6ft by 8ft & 3ft high, had to do a lot of work filling sand bags etc to keep the water out – very pleasant, only one change of shirt & just the uniform we stand up in, is all we have, wet & muddy to the knees – one has no idea what a quagmire of mud our lines are in & as we were fairly busy, it is no joke carrying wounded down a sap a mile long & can't keep your feet. No good growling – we try to make merry.\n","54":"\n\nMuch the same as yesterday – still raining. Luckily not much doing – here we have to do our own cooking in turns - \nquite easy to\n light a fire & great scarcity of wood. Fritz must have taken a fancy to our smoke, for at Breakfast & dinner he sent over some H. E. & shrapnel, which nearly spoilt our dinner, but jolly soon shifted us to our dug out.\n","55":"\n\nRather a decent day. Fritz shelling us off & on all day. I went down along the \n\nConvent Wall for water & while pumping, the dirty wretches nearly sniped me. I came away with half the quantity I wanted. I will try & find out particulars of the Convent, which has been a very large one , all that remains are a few heaps of bricks & stones - & a sort of court yard but ¼ mile square with a high brick wall some 12ft high, standing where not broken by shells, you can plainly see the remains of a beautiful gate & a substantial marble arch. It is here the Germans I believe carried out their shocking outrages. Used to be the Crown Princes Headquarters.\n","56":"\n\nDull & raining – Our Artillery going some off & on – not many cases, but they were mostly serious – one fellow had a self inflicted wound of the Femoral Artery, went off his head wanting to fight us etc.\n","57":"\n\nDull day – no rain – Artillery Duels & Fritz replying freely – No casualtys, but a few sick men reporting.\n","58":"\n\nVery fine day – Our artillery giving Fritz Pepper, his replies were very vicious, but with poor results – 15 out 25 duds. Shifted over & relieved the squad at Foray House – very poor dug out & leaking badly. No calls.\n","59":"\n\nRaw day & drizzling rain – Received a parcel of sox – soap – chocolates & Handkerchiefs from Mrs O'Kelly. Capt Bullin came out & paid us 40 francs. Fritz peppering the saps & coming dangerously near our dug out – terrible lot of duds. We have a dud on exhibition 60 pounder – nice souvenir to think it just missed us. Lucky enough to score two good books. The Sowers & Countess Tekla – to keep me occupied when not busy.\n","60":"\n\nDrizzling rain – Fairly quiet till late evening, then things fairly lively. Had a few calls about midnight.\n","61":"\n\nDull day – Shifted back to Convent Avenue. Bombarding all night, all sorts of fiendish man destroyers being used, never had a wink of\n\nsleep, machine guns rattling on our dug out till daylight – got some calls after midnight, the roads were under a heavy fire of set rifles & machine guns – you avoid one, but think the next might be a blighty.\n","62":"\n\nNice bright day. Heavy strafing off & on all day – also at 1 – 3 & 5 pm, it was just awful – our dug out was rocking like fun – Had no sleep & I as most of the men were shifted back, while the strafe was on we had surprisingly few casualtys, We Heard old Fritzs horn blowing for his Ambulance men freely – Officers say our Fire last night played great havoc.\n","63":"\n\nDull day – Fairly quiet – day & night. One of our Bearers stopped some shrapnel in the arm – One case of Typhoid from the front line.\n","64":"\n\nFair day – Shifted down to Croix Marchelle. The rats & mosquitoes are the worry of our lines. About midnight we were called out to attend some fellows whose dug out had\n\nfell in on top of them, all were bruised, but no bones broken – Next morning they had the dug out fixed up again & with a big notice \"Do drop in Dug Out” – Went for a walk as it was quiet into the Town of \"Fleurbaix”, nearly every building is more or less wrecked must have been some very heavy street fighting as a lot of houses are barricaded & loopholed for the machine Guns. The Church was intact till the first week of August, it is now like most of the other just a mass of debris – I got some of the glass from behind the altar as a Souvenir.\n","65":"\n\nNice day – Len Gurner was trying to make small chips with his pen knife to make a fire for breakfast & he cut the top of his finger clean off. I very fortunately stopped the bleeding almost immediately, he went in to see a doctor later & it started bleeding again, so much so that the artery had to be tied – Have Len on light duties – Very quiet.\n","66":"\n\nDull & raining – Had a few calls – Fritz very quiet\n","67":"\n\nDull day – A couple of our men suffering from \nnerves\n & insomnia – so had to go & relieve them at Foray House – Very busy during the night – had some bad cases – The Boys gave Fritz particular – Made some complaints about some inconveniences we had to put up with. Have been promised they will be rectified & the wounded will benefit accordingly.\n","68":"\n\nRaining – Mud & slush everywhere – Back again at Convent Avenue.

One day last week one of our planes was hit over \nLille\n but the Pilot managed to get the machine well over our lines by Volplaning, as soon as he landed Fritz put over Shrapnel, but the Pilot knew too much for Fritz as he landed ½ mile from where Fritz thought he did – The pilot was badly injured, we fixed him up - the Observer never had a scratch – Enjoy the company of the New Zealanders who are supplying the guard here – very fine fellows. Got letters from Mrs Single & Mrs Hagen. Have orders to stand to tonight – sent in for more men.\n","72":"\n\nNice day – Our Boys raided Fritz's trenches after heavy bombardment of trench mortars & Artillery – The raid was\n\nvery successful only two of lads killed. They brought back a number of Prisoners, some of whom were only lads of 16 yrs – also got a lot of information – Our point is already too far advanced – so gain nothing taking his trenches yet. Sgt Holt who was killed, was just about to get a Commission & had secretly inherited £12,000.

Heavy bombardment from both sides – Got a letter from M. Single. Fritz very busy with deadly minniewurzen, he got some M.G. fellows – one fellow named Jim Harsthorn, although badly injured injured, was a model patient, he was actually singing & joking – as he said to keep himself awake. Les Bowden took on Groom to A.D.M.S.\n","95":"\n\nNice day – A few calls during the night – Fritz putting over more minnies than shells on supports – Wrote to Frank, Anne & M.

In our unit a fellow has to go down on his hands & knees almost to get anything our Q.

Had a few calls during the night.\n","97":"\n\nDull day – Packing up stuff ready to shift out at a moments notice – rumour has it to the \nsomme\n. Heavy bombardment for about ¾ of an hour about 7.15 pm. General raids all along the front – As far as we know they were generally successful – 59th probably most successful – every man returned, some dozen fellows hit shrapnel & bomb fragments – all very slight – 57th never got over – as far as we know only one man killed, some of these were badly cut about – one Sailor bloke hard doer & made us all laugh – hit the Doctor on the back & said give us a \ntot\n Doc – never mind the ------ wound. Finished up about 1.30 am. When the raiders returned Fritz opened\n\nvery viciously machine & rifle fire, he chopped all around the Aid Post rest of the night.\n","98":"\n\nDull to drizzling rain. Ready to move out from 7 am. New Zealanders coming in all day relieving F. Amb never turned up till late – so we all had to stay back & introduce them to Saps etc. we had to do a bit of a perish as we had sent all our belongings in. Only one came through the night, a N.Z. who had been all thro the Somme. All these men have come from the Somme – Rumour has it that we are to make for the Somme.\n","99":"\n\nDull & cold – Not relieved till midday – by the N.Z. Fld Amb – Our Motor Cars took us to where the rest of the Ambulance are billeted in Estaires – I had a good old hot bath & were allowed the freedom of Estaires – Thompson, Westwood & I went to the Tommys Divisional Picture Show & really enjoyed it, as it was such a change – a few Tommy Artists – Conjuring etc. Some of the lads made it a welter late at night & told the Colonel off when he tried to quieten them. We are billetted in a Convent School – the war seems to be interfering with their business as\n\nthere is plenty of room for us all.\n","100":"\n\nNice day – but very cold also at night – went to Mass at 10.30 – by Father Gilbert. All confined to billet area – as I expected after last night – I managed to sneak out along the river as I have marked on a post card – Struck a lot of 59th Boys in an a Estaminet – also some French fellows who could play & sing – had a good old sing song – Got a snap taken of myself all dirty – etc just as I came from Rifle Villa yesterday – they are breakups – owing to the Division moving all mail is hung up – just managed to get some of the snaps thro to Frank.\n","101":"\n\nVery cold day – Our Section on Fatigues & still confined to Billet area. Had read out on parade about voting on conscription – Amused ourselves most of the day by stump electioneering speeches for & against, very funny. Most of the boys got out after tea & got merry & it is only a rumour things were not gay till the small hours – all determined to have a bit of fun if going to be confined.\n","102":"\n\nNice day – All spare men went for a route march. Ordered to prepare pack etc to move out.\n\nGot an issue of rum at midnight & marched out – met large motor transports, 30 men were packed in each, went to ‘Baileull ‘ some 10 miles & here loaded all waggons, horses – men etc – Train moved off about 5 am – rammed into a dirty smelling wet horse waggons & couldn't sit down – took train around by Calais – Bologne –\n","103":"\n\nVery cold travelling – never stopped only for a few minutes at junctions – never had anything to eat since tea last night – Arrived at ‘Port Reny” about 4.30 pm. Had to unload everything & then got a cup of coffee & biscuits – left \"Port Reny” 5.30 pm – arrived at billets about 8.30 pm, after much cursing – roads were awful & it was drizzling & so dark couldn't see way – fell over a siding 6ft deep & never said – Having had no sleep last night & nothing to eat today – I felt very queer with Headache & cold – got an issue of rum & went to bed – no time before we were asleep – must have marched some 8 or 9 miles.\n","104":"\n\nRain came through barn last night & I got blankets etc wet, pinched some wood & made a bit of a fire\n\nto dry everything – still raining – had breakfast at 10.30 am – Voted about midday – The country here is very hilly – the name of this village is \"Bouchon”. Went for a walk through the Village on the hill named L'Etoile An old church some 100 yrs old looks very imposing – it being the highest on the Hill – the grave yard is all around the Church. Got some of the finest wine I ever tasted here they call it \"Malaga”. \n\nA couple of our own Amb men down with Pneumonia, also several of the Brigade men reporting ill.\n","105":"\n\nVery heavy frost – I was very cold all night, we all have only one blanket – a lot of us to try & get warm went for a walk over the hill & around the Church to Village – bought a post card showing the Village. Butchers Shop – couldn't get any of the Church. It was a great sight to see hundreds of motor transports passing along the road – the 14th Brigade moved out in motor transport, our own transport also left at midday – The people here to be more genuine French than those of the north & Flanders, they are very courteous & obliging – Took over Motor Amb Cars from 17th Tommy Division, they are riddled with shrapnel, they tell some cheerful tales of some cars last seen going heavenwards.\n","106":"\n\nA sunny day – bitterly cold & heavy frosts as we marched out of Bouchon at 7.30 am, went as far as Merfleurs – here about 150 motor transport waggons were lined up to take us, it was a great sight – the French drivers looked like Eskimos wrapped in their Goat skins, it made us feel colder. Each waggon took 30 men – we passed through Flexicourt, Pequigny, Amiens, we got out on the outskirts of Albert & walked about 9 miles – here we were within the sounds of the guns again – They are pushing on with a new Railway line as far as possible so as to assist in the conveyance of material etc – the Red Cross train runs up near Albert. It started to freeze again about 4 pm – We got ½ pint of tea, which was cold when it reached us & had to sleep under a canvas awning – the ground was wet & cold & frozen.\n","107":"\n\nVery cold & frosty – no heat in the sun – Never slept a wink last night – have had an awful headache all day – All Bearers were lined up after bare tea & biscuits & marched out to Reserve lines, we must have covered some 14 miles, we were all stiff & sore & hungry – no rations to be had and\n\nwater as scarce as beer – just halted & were told we had to put in the night here – if we could find a Funk hole well & good, if not we had to make the best of it – self & 2 others rigged up a dug out & I had a little tea & sugar in my emergency ration, so I made a fire & boiled my own little dixie & shared it, although I could have drunk two myself – had no rations issued at all today – As we are lined up against rows of guns of every calibre, it is that deafening & nerve racking that I couldn't sleep – We passed thro Delville Wood – Mametz Wood & Fricourt you would pass without knowing – Have seen the German line from where the big push started – here can be seen dug outs 30 feet away & were lit up with electric light – We are given to understand all the Australians are coming to this front to have a go at Bapaume. Hereabouts you see Motor Cars – Water carts – G.S. waggons bogged to the axle – teams of horses pulling their hardest to get up ammunition – rations – etc.\n\n23\/10\/16 Monday\n\nHeavy frost again – Marched off in the fog at 6.30 am no breakfast – Capt Macintosh who was leading us got bushed & instead of going about 5 miles to\n\nsupport lines, we must have gone 8 miles, are now within 500 yards of Fritz. All the Ambulance bearers are working together – 8th do 8 hours – the 14th do 8 hours & the","108":" 8 hours, as we have to carry patients back some 5 miles we work relay posts of 8 or 12 at posts – it is very heavy work bearing here – it is impossible to get along at all in the trenches – so we carry on top 4 or 6 men to a stretcher – you slip this way – then that & by trying to dodge one shell hole you fall into another. – It is quite true to say over nearly every yard of ground there is a shell hole, some of which you could bury a horse & cart. It is enough to turn one up the nights – the unburied germans the partly buried ones – which are easy enough to see by some portion sticking out – the stench also is cruel, on this account we very seldom used a Fritz dug out as some of them are full of dead & the entrance thrown down. The Germans were in this spot exactly three weeks ago – Any amount of Souvenirs to be had, but unless small & light the weight kills a man on the forced marches we had had lately & we have no chance of getting them away. About ½ mile away is a wrecked tank & coming\n\nin yesterday we saw two waiting to go out any time. Night & day is just the same here as the shells are going over without a stop from thousands of guns as fast as they can load up. One thing we notice here – we are not subjected to the same rifle shooting & snipping as to what we got South of Armentiers I must say I've never seen such big guns as they have here – We are all over mud & in places have to wade through slush up to your knees – our feet are always wet & cold & only have the uniform we stand up in – our overcoats get wet & muddy & it is a load to carry them – as there is never enough sun to dry anything. Fritz must be getting hell. Had 1\/5th of a loaf of bread – scrape of jam & a 2 x 3 in piece of cheese for 24 hrs.\n","109":"\n\nVery cold & drizzling – Have ½ pint of tea & left for the Aid post at 6.30 am – No rations issued found a tin of bully beef & had a few iron biscuits – the only drinking water we get in out of shell holes. Was stationed at Mac Cormacks post, going strong all day – it is breaking all our hearts being always wet, short & shabby rations – the heavy work & slipping & sliding everywhere. Incessant heavy bombardment – Fritz replying not too slowly\n","110":"\n\nBitterly cold & raining – Had ½ pint of like warm tea & started out – Stationed at (Goose Avenue) Supposed to be relieved at midday by 14th Field – got word had to carry on till 6 pm. We cursed & swore at everybody – nothing to eat all day & doing horses work – Very busy – Got home at 8.15 pm one of our bearers was knocked up so had to get him along as best we could in the dark. Fritz shelling very freely – Two of our Bearers have got \nblightys\n from Shrapnel. As it is impossible for us to convey the wounded down the saps – we have to do it all over the top & we are under observation from Fritz on his slight elevation – we have been that disgusted with tucker – conditions etc lately, that I can safely say without exaggeration – we do not mind the shells in the least although continually dropping within a hundred yards of us & we treat shrapnel with almost scorn. As I was quite resigned to any fate on enlisting – I must expect something. It is very evident a lot of us will never leave the Somme. I am sadly afraid our Infantry are also disheartened & as great things are expected of them they are not getting a fair show, they should\n\nhave been here 6 weeks ago, when not so cold & nice & dry. From our front line can be seen the steeple of a Church at Bapaume. Had a bit of so called stew & tea both cold. Rations supposed to be issued to squads of 12 men – quite a mystery none to be found – to bed a stiff – sore – cold & wet Australian dinkum. \n","111":"\n\nDrizzling Rain. Had the day off till 4 pm then started for \"Turk Lane” – relieved the 8th – Did an awful perish all night – altho 3 of us worked hard all day trying to make a bit of a shelter – it kept the wind & cold out a bit, but the rain came thro. Made a fire in a tin & nursed it during the night. Ted Powell went to sleep with feet against the tin – I also had just dozed off when I was rudely awakened by \"Powell” falling over me, this puttees alight – I burnt all my hands trying to smother it – Fairly busy during the night. Guns going a treat all around us without cessation. Fritz replying poorly.\n","112":"\n\nDrizzling rain & cold as frogs – Shifted up to Grove Avenue – fairly busy. About a dozen of our bearers are out of action through blightys – sprained ankles\n\nshell shock etc – Three fellows that used to carry with me have gone off with shell shock \"Penfold, Weeks & Hand”. In my wildest dreams, I never thought war meant anything ‘like this' – our feet are always wet, our clothes are all over mud & we are getting very poor rations – it is almost unbearable we have to sleep anywhere & on the whole line there's not a decent dug out that would stop a shell, we certainly would all strike to a man on any other mission, tucker or no tucker – wet or dry – cold etc, the only thing that keeps us going is our poor \ncobbers\n, who are so helpless when wounded – What a different tune the ignoramuses sing now of Stretcher Bearers. I haven't had a decent sleep for a week. Had many narrow escapes today – many H.E. burst within 50 yds of me – have been hit with scraps of shrapnel & covered with mud. Saw two of our Aeroplanes brought down after an exciting air dud with a Taub – one poor fellow just dropped plane & all within our lines - & within 10 seconds he was just a charred mass, as he touched the ground there was just one violent explosion & flames finished this sad sight. Two Taubs brought down later. The weather is all against us or the Boys would be in\n\nBapaume ere this.\n","113":"\n\nDrizzling rain & blowing a treat – relieved at 5.30 pm. Had a fairly easy day. Heavy Bombardment night & day – Fritz sending over plenty of H.E. Shrapnel. Had a fairly good sleep after a good nip of rum back at our dump \n5\n miles back. Going home in the dark. Capt Elliott, Capt Medcalf got bogged to the knees – Sergt Stevenson in trying to help got bogged worse than either. I went away & got a spade – dug Stevenson out first, then Elliott, we got Capt Medcalf out minus his boots, he had to walk home barefooted – I couldn't help laughing & said didn't \"Bairnsfather” hit it nicely – Bairnsfather he said, what time do they feed the Sea lions. I think surely there must be a special place place in either Heaven or hell for us Volunteers – I haven't struck a man yet who didn't ease his mind by curses when he fell about 6 ft into a shell hole. Actually got letters from Annie – Jess Hagan & L. Single, all of whom say they haven't received any news of me for 3 months, this is very consoling to a bloke doing a perish here.\n","114":"\n\nBlowing like the Devil & cold enough for sleet. Had the day off 3 pm, then set out to relieve the 14th at McCormacks. Got absolutely our 2nd issue of comforts in the shape of a pair of soxs. Had some narrow squeaks coming in – Very busy all night. Never experienced such a cold night, feet just like as tho they didn't belong to me, even the proverbial 40 winks out of the question. We are all praying for a little decent weather to let our lads have a fly & get away from this cursed hole called the Somne. Get no news at all here of the outside world. The usual cannonading & nerve racking noises.\n","115":"\n\nRaining & colder if anything – Horrors & more horrors of war – A couple of horses & sledges were introduced to assist us in conveying the wounded – they are not bad & much quicker – but as a few bearers have to be in attendance, to avoid ruts etc, the horse goes thro slush 2 ft deep & of course we have to follow. Very heavy rain late in the evening & right thro the night, every\n\nportion of me is wet & muddy, tried hard to keep warm – not dry in a wet dug out, or rather an apology for a dug out – Went & relieved the 8th at Flers post. No sleep – Our ratioon is getting better – plenty of bully & biscuits & shell hole water – what we miss is hot tea & we are not even issued with tea & sugar. Fairly busy night & day.\n","116":"\n\nCold but fine from daylight. It is heartrending to see the boys coming from the firing line – wet through & mud to the neck, fagged out & completely done in. Our overcoats are an awful failure for this climate, they are heavy enough dry but when wet & muddy - it is only a good man can get along with them – Have had about 50 infantry men around our post all the morning – cold & shivering & begging for tea & water – of these we can't get enough for ourselves – Have heard big strong men say I could just sit down & cry with disgust – Words fail me to even try to describe things as they are here – one has to go thro it – in the crowds that go by – lads of 19 yrs look as tho twice the age, older man still more haggard, we had a heavy shower about 3 pm fine rest of day. Fritz shelling our Post Flers heavily, made my little funk hole a water hole into rock. Here we are near a battery & while the\n\n \n\nD.A.C. were bringing ammunition, they are under observation no doubt from the steeple of the Church at Bapaume – 2 men & 2 mules were sent hurling thro space & 4 others were badly injured, strange again to say even while our boys ran across the 100 yds to render aid not one of us got a scratch but awfully near – Another very strange coincidence, at Flers here we 12 men detailed from the Infantry to assist us in the bearing – 3 of these men were sitting in a dug out not 75 yds from me when 1 fellow was killed instantly, the other two had both legs blown off from the thighs & they were in great agony, we could not do much for these poor fellows, but we hurried them on to headquarters so as to give them every chance – I daresay they would be dead by the time they got there – 1 8th F.Amb Bearer & 1 R.S. Bearer were also killed to day. Gor relieved at 3 pm & went back to our dump – found our Funk hole here all wet – hadn't even a dry pair of soxs to put on. Had a very fair sleep.\n","117":" – 1916 Wednesday\n\nCold & dull – little rain – issued with Anti frost Grease which we rub into our feet – We all look like prehistoric men, a few of us have not had a wash, but have not shaved for the last 10 days & have not\n\ntaken our clothes off for a longer period. Took over Runner Post from 14th, running two Posts with only 4 sets of Bearers – going like fury all the night – sent up for relief about midnight & only got one extra squad of 4. We were all completely done in from ploughing knee deep thro the stiff mud – Absolutely the hardest & most disheartening night we ever put in – our Doctors & N.C.O.'s seemed to be ignorant of the fact that we had to carry from Runners to Dressing Station. We all refused duty at 2-30 am unless we got more men, were told in answer to our deputation that we could have 48 hrs off, so we struggled on. 3 Bearers of B Section got knocked today, 2 seriously & 1 lightly.\n","118":"\n\nRaining & Cold. Went up & Relieved at North Road – Fritz shelling in our vicinity all day – quite monotonous to be always saying we had more narrow escapes. Busy all day & night. Beastly accommodation, feet & clothes wet since I came out, half our bearers getting trench feet, can feel my own feet tingling & swelling. One of the bearers – poor Hopkins who got hit yesterday died before we got in, the other fellow we all think there is no hope for him. Had a busy night.\n","119":"\n\nDrizzling rain & very cold. Heavy bombarding night & day – Fritz shelling all party's on the skyline. Capt Helstrom got some shrapnel thro the sleeve of his coat & is very nervy. While waiting for cases outside of R.A.P., we noticed two fellows just on the brow of the hill fall after a H.E. burst, 4 of us doubled up quick as possible to investigate, both were only slightly wounded – one fellows helmet undoubtedly saved him. Whilst bandaging them, we were under observation – Fritz sent over more H.E. & shrapnel – I thought my time had come – got them in safely – so much for the respect to Red Cross men. Were relieved about 6 pm by the 7th F. Amb & believe we the Division is going out for a spell – Going home we were all tired, foot sore & weary, but we had to hickory as Fritz followed us up with shrapnel. Had a good feed of hot stew when we got to the dump – also issued with a cake of chocolate & rum – had a very fair sleep.\n","120":"\n\nDull day – Got rudely awakened at 6.45 am, to be ready to march out at 7.45 – after much cursing etc we formed four & took the road leading thro Contalmaison & on the outskirts of Albert to \n\nBécordel where the balance of the Ambulance in conjunction with other ambulances are running a Clearing Station – all necessary & urgent operations are performed here previous to evacuating further on – Arrived here very tired about midday & had more & better tucker today than we have had for the past 6 days. Got a very nice letter from L. Nock which brightened me up a bit, also G. Hegerty.\n","121":"\n\nRaining – Breakfast at 7 am, which we all enjoyed – All hands mustered & the Bearers were told to report to Colonel Phipps at the 5th F. Amb who clear all walking cases – about ¼ of a mile from us – only a rumour there was not a protest, we named every officer & paraded – our W.O. Geo. Black also worked hard to get us a spell – no luck, so we all paraded sick – it was the fun of the world – personally I was supposed to have a very bad cold & a strained tendon of the heel, some of them put up good cases – but it was very noticeable that we were all marked duty – The Officer saw the joke & laughed immensely – at any rate we got off till 2 pm & then had to report – they had the cheek to put us on trying to make the roads around the\n\n5th F. Amb. Dressing Tents respectable, we did as much harm as good I think – very strange the Infantry can march out & have their spell we certainly gave our best night & day for the past fortnight, as well as run all risks – even the Infantry complimented us & said they would rather stay in the firing line – so much for our Colonels ignorance of what we have had to go through.\n","122":"\n\nDrizzling & very cold. Road making continues – went into Albert – some 2 miles away for bricks & debris to fill up holes – drew the bricks from the ruins of the Town Hall immediately opposite the Cathredral – the Cathredral is a very fine building & although it has been shelled a good deal it is not beyond renovating – A most remarkable feature of the ruins is the stature of the Virgin Mary & Child which she is holding above her head as tho signifying the saviour of the world – since the bombardment, the stature – which was the extreme point of the steeple, is now hanging over at an angle below right angle to the main steeple – this item will no doubt go down to History. Some of the 2nd Division took an important ridge with a fort, they were \n\nrepulsed twice, but managed to hang on at the third attempt. Wounded coming in pretty freely – Was 0ffered a good job in the Operating theatre – but refused. Everybody's opinion if we only got a week or ten days fine weather the Australians would take Bapaume.\n","123":"\n\nRain off & on & very cold – blowing a treat – Road contract hangs on – while excavating at Albert today, I found amongst the bricks etc a little afternoon tea cup & egg cup to match – strange to say they were unbroken – so I will try & send them on to Laurie Bourke. A fair number of wounded coming in. Very poor rations all day.\n","124":"\n\nTrying hard to be fine – Were relieved from the Road Contract about 9 am – came back to our own Ambulance, was told off to No 3 Preparatory Tent, here we have to cut all clothes away from wounded & check any belongings – Started to send a few cards for Xmas – could only get one class in Albert – our tired Officers will only allow us to send one card away per day. Taubs & Zeppelins about midnight, dropped about\n\na dozen bombs round about here, gave us all a bit of a scare. Last night one of our big siege guns was doing some business & it just rocked everything, must have been a naval 15 inch.\n\n9\/11\/16 Thursday\n\nNo rain – but raw sort of day – Assisting in the Operating Tent – very busy night & day, here there are 8 Tables & about a dozen Doctors, some awful wounds & plenty of amputations, my hours are from 8 am to 8.30 pm – quite tied up.\n\n10\/11\/16 Friday\n\nVery nice day & fine – On duty at Operating Tent. Not so many casualtys today, the 1st & 2nd Divisions seem to be getting a rough time. German Aeroplanes dropping bombs freely during the night, very little damage done hereabouts – Our Guns bombarding very heavily during the night, which was a lovely clear moonlight. We got in a fellow with both legs blown off, he was leading a horse, when they walked on a dud & it exploded – A Tommy while leading a horse to water, the horse fell thro a dug out & inside there were two german spys.\n\n11\/11\/16 Saturday\n\nDull but fine – Heavy bombardment still continues, looking forward to something big if it keeps fine – very few casualtys in today, but the Australians are coming in by dozens – sick trench feet – effects of cold etc. Fritz shelled the Advanced Dressing Station at Thistle Dump – injured seriously 4 Bearers & killed two – 6th & 7th Stretcher Bearers have had a lot of casualtys in the field since we came out – Got hold of a paper today & it referred to the coolness of a Battalion that Fritz caught while changing over in broad daylight – it said in spite of heavy casualtys, they just continued as if nothing had interrupted – this happened to be the 54th Batt – coming out & the 56th going in, well do I remember it – I was right in it & make special mention of being extra busy on","125":" Saw 2 Taubs brought down in good style this evening. Fritz shelled our quarters here for about half an hour during the night – nobody injured, a few waggons etc destroyed, nearest shell to where I was in\n\nthe Operating Tent was about 75 yds away – A lot of the Doctors & \ntent Division\n who have never been near the firing line, were in a blue funk.\n","126":"\n\nDull & foggy. Heavy bombardment continues – a lot of \"Furphys” knocking about, that Bapaume has fallen but I can't believe it – we have had nothing officially – Very few lying down cases in. Got a party to take my place for a while as I heard there was to be Benediction etc in the Village Church of \"Meault” which is about 3 miles away – The Rosary etc started at 5.30 – the Church was crowded mostly by that very fine body of men of Irish Guards – with a smattering of Irish Australians – finished up by singing the grand old Hymn Glorious St Patrick. \n\nTaubs come over this way nearly every night & turn on machine Guns around the Camp, believe our airmen have retaliated & given him fits.\n","127":"\n\nFine & Frosty.

Glad to say one of airmen who was up got him, brought him down not far from here & again we had the displeasure of dressing the occupant & who in answer to why he had shelled etc our quarters, very profusely apologized & said they thought it was an aerodrome.

We made Tables out of Ammunition boxs & laid blankets for a cloth. We had 6 Candles on the tables on empty jam tins also had a nice coal fire in a braizier. We had many toasts, most of which were wet ones. The speech of the evening really was that of H. Page – ex Clergyman & one of our S.Br. His Toast was \"Those we have left behind”. My Toast, not being too good & having no voice – I was allowed a little liberty, so I picked the Toast (To our Comrades & Bearers who had fallen – their deeds & valour) – which of course needed no speech, we stood with bowed heads for a few seconds & drank the toast in silence. We tried hard to make merry in spite of our gloomy\n\nsurroundings, it was very cold & raining a treat, & although out of shell fire in a sense, a very heavy bombardment was going on. We finished up about 9 pm, quite pleased to have had such a jolly evening.\n","158":"\n\nHeavy snow falling night & day – a section of our Bearers moved out to take over A.D.S. at Bernafay wood.

Hardly any casualtys – helped to bury three lads of the 14th Brigade, who were killed by a shell striking their Hut.

Also saw a big German interment camp – where several hundred Fritzs - they mostly work on roads & look a jolly sight better than our own boys. \n\nApart from the motor car, I had to walk about 10 miles, got home in time for night duty, but feeling very tired – Very\n\nbusy all night – as the 15th Brigade made a raid, got some good information & many prisoners – mostly German, Poles & the famous cowardly Prussian Guard, who Kamerard very quickly at close quarters.\n","187":"\n\nNot quite so cold – Had a good sleep during the day – Very busy during the night – Fritz put up a very heavy barrage of shrapnel & Gas shells over Needle & Rose trenches – good many 32nd Batt were caught in the Gas – poor devils did suffer – an Officer died from effects during the night. Heavy bombardment all along the line.\n","188":"\n\nNot quite so cold – a bit of a thaw set in & it is getting a bit muddy. About daylight Fritz managed to bomb one of our ammunition dumps about 2 miles away – such a deafening noise of the shells exploding all day long I have never heard before – the sky was left black with clouds from the bursts – must have been a very big loss. Our planes got busy during the day – saw two Fritzs planes brought down, also two of ours, poor devils were burnt to death. A few more gassed cases came through, only a few wounded.\n\nCorporal Fooks & Pte Burns 59th Batt Medical details – died as the result of burns from petrol igniting – 3 others were charred beyond recognition.\n","189":"\n\nQuite warm – getting very muddy & dirty.

Busy with trench feet & wounded all night. All sorts of rumours about great gains on our front – but nothing official.\n","197":"\n\nFairly Cold. Fairly busy night and day – Got orders at very short notice to be ready to march out ant time – Finally only B Section went out & opened a new Aid Post.\n\nThe Whole Ambulance was supposed to move forward some three miles & open up a Main Dressing Station – the order seemed to be cancelled later – or perhaps our gains are not as great as anticipated. Wounded men tell us that the 10th Batt men are in Bapaume – practically no resistance? – supposed gains along the line are from 1,000 yds to 5 miles. Got a batch of 50 reinforcements.\n","198":"\n\nQuite night – Slight rain – Fine day mostly – Planes & Balloons up in the evening – All reinforcements sent on to relieve posts – Poor devils were nearly scared to death at the prevailing conditions & Fritzs barrages.

Got official news that \"Bagdad” had fallen. Good news comes in about our sector too – \"\nIrles\n” & several other Villages captured. Dispensers busy all night testing water, which we think the Germans have been poisoning – it is Arsenic if anything. Orders are also out about any eatables that Fritz has left behind him. Also forbidding any of the Village residents back in our region to supply troops with bread. Sent Cables to Mrs O'Kelly & J. O'Hagan contradicting report of having been wounded.\n","215":"\n\nDull to raining. Some very big guns firing all around us – the concussion putting out lights & knocking things over. Got news papers from the Single and M.Evans \n","216":"\n\nFairly good day – Aeroplanes up most of the day. Artillery very active . Went over and inspected a big naval 12 inch\n\nGun on the line near Carnoy, it is a wonderful piece of mechanism & was firing at 14 miles range. Some fellows were blowing out rats with gelignite – the result was that also blew up an old German Mine at Cost Corner – near Montabaun Camp – some 90 casualtys – 10 killed outright – many huts – tents blown to bits.\n","217":" 16\/3\/.17\n\nNice day. Heavy trench & patrol fighting. The Boys still forcing Fritz back. Good few trench feet & wounded coming through.\n","218":"\n\nNice day – Very mild – At 7.30 am the Australians pushed on after heavy fighting & took possession of Bapaume, great excitement in all ranks – men who were fagged – men who were back in camps some 6 miles – although they had only settled – speedily volunteered & were most eager to be up & doing – men who would probably have been in our the Amb hands tomorrow, from various complaints exhaustion etc, forgot about such things\n\n& with wonderful tenacity, just pushed, it was a great tonic for the boys, to be up on top again, practically out of the mud & slush & fighting in Virgin Country. The 13th L.H. & Indian Cavalry were brought into action & put up some running fights with Fritzs rearguard patrols. Also got news that La Fransloy & Peronne are in imminent danger & must fall in a day or two. A number of our Bearers out of necessity followed on to Bapaume. In one way we were disappointed because we had made arrangements between ourselves to have a bit of an Irish Concert – we were too busy & everything was topsy turvy. We have with us at present a very popular R.C. Padre Father Law – he is always worrying about the Boys & he is nearly always present when wounded are coming – night & day.\n\nWorth recording a funny incident that happened him – he was going up to the line the other night & being very dark – some private Anzac ran into him & was immediately greeted with – say mate aint it a -----\n\nFather Law equal to the occasion, he put his torch on him & said – Well yes for this time I agree with you – Anzac very profuse in his apologies when he recognised him.\n","219":"\n\nVery mild & fine day. Div. H.Q'rs established 2 miles beyond Bapaume, much patrol fighting going on 7 miles out. Everybody & everything nearly shifting forward – Fritz set nearly every 3rd Building alight in Bapaume & blew up everything of any use – everybody moving very cautiously on account of mines – also very careful of picking up Souvenirs – we treat all water with suspicion – Good few trench feet & wounded through – some L.H. & several Indian – they report no sight of main body of enemy, ten miles out only patrols. Australians also took La Fransloy – much to the disgust of 20th Div of Tommys who were reckoning on being first there – all available Amb men pushing on with Division. Got official news of the Abdication of the Czar.\n\nNo Artillery firing only machine guns & rifles – very quiet behind the lines just as tho no war at all were on. Started evacuating from Bapaume to 6th Fld Amb at Pozieres by motor car service. A Zepplein reported brought down by gun fire at daylight near Amiens. 2 others escaped – heard they made a raid on Kent, England.\n","220":"\n\nCold & strong wind blowing – but fine. Went for a cruise about over the country that we have just gained. Perhaps no pen will ever tell of the hardships – of the tenacity of the dash – of the mud – of the filth of the last trench, before Fritz pushed off – what a Hell the last No Mans Land is – Germans & Australians lay there in hundreds – saw a Captain hung up on the entanglements – also a Lance Corporal who had died but not without his victim, who lay alongside him – Many souvenirs in the nature of Photos, post cards, etc were offering but as the weather had a bad effect on that class of staff, I preferred to leave it all alone.\n\nWhat a refreshing tonic it was to me, but how much more to the Infantry, to leave behind the last mud hole & see once again Virgin country & actually green grass – I went through the Villages of Flers – Ligny – Guedecourt & Beaulencourt – Guedecourt seemed to be principally a great death trap for the Indian Lancers who tried hard to take it, but went down in a heap – I found one of their swords & gave it to a Dr. At a Dressing Station of Fritzs I found the graves of 4 Australians – 15th Batt., who must have died in Fritzs charge. Counted 4 of our Planes, which had fell in Fritzs line once. At Beaulencourt I got a few nice souvenirs – The Church is badly Knocked about – yet strange to say a few stations of the Cross & statues are still intact & almost seem to say why this sacriledge. \n\nIn what was once a beautiful Chemists Home, I noticed also that two sacred pictures seemed to defy the bombardment, for they were still in grand order & had not even shifted out of their position. Along side the Church – no doubt the presbytery, I\n\nnoticed a very fine Library – all the works were in French – Encyclopedias etc, all badly knocked about. Our Division and Amb are proud of the fact that they were the first to enter Bapaume & La Fransloy. Kept fairly busy – hardly any sleep for about 50 hours.\n","221":"\n\nVery windy & cold – snowed a little, also a light rain fell. Dr. Hughes M.O. to the 59th Batt. Killed by shrapnel. He was a great favourite & a real white man. Our Division still out in skirmishing order – several sharp encounters with patrols of mostly snipers – a few wounded Fritzs came through. Light Horse & the Indians had isolated engagements with Uhlans. Got official news that the French on our right have made much progress also. Most of the wounded have only bullet wounds.\n","222":"\n\nRaw sort of day – but fine. Division are out 8 miles from Bapaume at one point, the Boys rushed a village in daylight & got it, fairly large number of wounded coming thro – but Fritz got particular amusement.\n\nAmbulance busy establishing relay and Aid Post – also testing all water etc. Official news – given gains along an 82 mile front from 2 to 10 miles in depth. Many fires can be seen in the distance which means – Villages being destroyed by Kultur. A few casualtys amongst the Bearers – Several explosions in the Villages – no doubt mines – set going by somebody – possibly lifting a souvernir or something.\n","223":"\n\nSnowing last night & several snow storms during the day – Instead of sleeping I took a run around the Villages of Ligny – Thiloy – Beaulencourt – Frans Loy & went through Bapaume. Everywhere can be seen the unpardonable destruction by the Huns, not satisfied by attempting to burn Bapaume, they have blown out walls on to the street to try & stop our advance – have blown up big mine craters in the roads, chopped down almost every standing tree, most of them across roads – they have even fell every fruit tree in the Villages. Bapaume is still\n\nburning in places, altho we put a lot of places out. In the line of valuables – such as furniture etc – I daresay £10 would buy the lot – they even took the statue erected in the square to Gen ------- in 1870 who liberated them. I got several souvenirs such as receipts & Photos. While in Bapaume the Albatross Aeroplane, which was brought down last evening by our airmen, was brought in & was Photographed by war corespondents outside of the Town Hall. Harry Harnden & myself were in the mob. The driver of Taut – which was one of the improved type turned out to be Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia – he was forced to land with his machine intact & he tried to escape, some of the 29th Batt. fellows shot him, he was shot in the abdomen & some of our Amb. fellows took charge of him, he died later at the C.C. Sontsede of Bologne. Heavy village fighting also much patrol & guerrilla warfare going on – Fair numbers of wounded through. Villages can be plainly seen burning in the distance. It seems very\n\nstrange to be walking in places, which were once the death zone, for the brave or curious. Great credit is due in my opinion to those responsible for the burning of the dead – it is very refreshing to see no dead laying about – to have buried the numbers probably some five figures, speaks for itself as to how these partys have worked.\n","224":"\n\nFine day – windy & cold. Got orders to pack up & move forward – the order was cancelled later. One would think there was no war on as Bapaume & behind is that quiet. Good number of casualtys through. Fritz counter attacked in some of the Villages.\n\nSaturday 24\/3\/17\n\nVery frosty & windy – as cold a day as we have yet experienced. Much stubborn fighting going on 5 miles this side of Cambrai – nearly 300 hundred prisoners came through – some of the 15th Machine Gunners & 8th Infantry we fear have been taken prisoners after stiff fighting.\n\nPut our time on one hour, to be in keeping with French time. All the Boys growling because of no Mail – I haven't had any decent mail since","225":"\n","226":"\n\nVery frosty & bitterly cold, Heavy fighting roundabout Cambrai & St Quentin, we are quite at Home again to hear some of Fritzs shells whistling again & the boom of our own guns. Get daily news of Huns outrages & destruction. We have records & proof of Arsenic & other poisons in all drinking water – to say nothing of the filth & corruption he has thrown into springs & wells – all looking forward to a relief at an early date. \n\nVery few casualtys through – Sent on a few Souvernirs – Receipts etc to Frank. Saw four of our planes brought down after sharp duels.\n","227":"\n\nDull day – Very cold. Much patrol fighting going on – Good few casualtys. Town Hall in Bapaume which was in fairly good order, excepting for the windows & the Tower, being shot down. Blew up at midnight last night, evidently by a mine set to a clock bomb\n\nor perhaps a spy as 3 were caught to day. Partys on excavating – several got out alive – Two French M.P.s are missing as they slept in the cellars.\n","228":"\n\nDull & very cold – Very few casualtys.\n","229":"\n\nDull – very cold – several snow storms. Very quiet day & few casualtys. About all the missing have been recovered from the Town Hall, which is now hard to recognize as once being a fine building. I visited the Bapaume Cemetery – which is very fine & some beautiful Tombs & Headstones of marble & granite are to be seen. The Huns here have further outraged the French people & civilization by tearing up French graves & burying some 1000 odd soldiers – also obliterated head stones & re painted. The French have erected a monument in honour of her fallen soldiers also to commemorate the Recapture of Bapaume in 1871 – The Huns have erected a monument some 50 yards away as a set off against this to the memory of their dead, also to celebrate his taking of Bapaume 1914-1915. No doubt\n\nif the Huns had buried their dead outside or even alongside, they could have expected every respect from the French – but at this stage it is hard to say what is going to be the outcome. Also went through the ruins of the Church, which like all others is just a heap of bricks etc & a portion of the wall standing – In the Sacristy it was hard to believe that the several feet of rubbish consisted mostly of the most beautiful Priests Vestments, with a smattering of big Bibles & many fine books in different languages which once must have been a very valuable library. Not content with trampoling such to say nothing of the statues, paintings etc – the filth and other abominations were disgusting – The Town Hall business has made all the lads very bitter. What is the French Mother of the rising generation going to teach her children? In the middle of the Church is a deep cellar, which we explored, here we found thousands of skulls – which brings up History of 1785 – and the French Revolution – the Guillotine etc – it is such places that the Heads of the unfortunate aristocracy were thrown, to be viewed by Anzacs centurys later – The Convent\n\nnearby is also just a heap & heaps of coal have been thrown down and all around the wells.\n","230":"\n\nDull day, cold & drizzling rain. Rest of the ambulance – excepting a small party left behind to run the Station at Bernafay terminus under Major Pigdon, left for Bapaume to make 15th H.Q. there. Myself & a lot of others left for Buigny to make up a team of mobile Bearers. Only a few casualtys. Altho the roads are good in places & much superior to what we have been used to, but the amount of traffic & the drizzling rain makes it very slushy & our feet never dry. Fritz shelling around us very freely with big stuff.\n","231":"\n\nDull – cold & drizzling rain. Very few casualtys. Drinking water hard to get hold of – so many traps of filth etc. Harry Ramsden found some womens clothes in Labarcoque & dressed up in them, he did look a break up even made the Adjutant laugh. Heavy firing at night.\n","232":"\n\nCold & drizzling rain. Very few casualtys. One of our observation Balloons bombed by Fritzs Aeroplanes & came down in flames quite near us. It was a very smart bit of work, speaking without prejudice\n","233":"\n\nDull day – Few casualtys through the day. Two more of our Balloons brought down in flames in our sector. Got orders at midnight to attach ourselves to Dr. Elliott & the 56th Battalion as there is to be a stunt at daylight -. We marched out with the 56th at ¼ to one o'clock & took post in a sunken road, up to our knees in mud & water & as cold as possible – we were just behind the firing line – not allowed to make any noise, strike matches, etc – just shiver till daylight, some of us made little bits of shelter in the bank to get away from the wind – We will probably have to act as Regimental stretcher bearers, personally I am quite resigned to act in any capacity & only too pleased to go forward with the boys. Bob Windsor, Adrian Feint & myself if anything should happen, have mutually agreed to look after any personal effects. Luckily feeling pretty fit & not a bit nervy – The next few days\n\nhave much in store for us.\n\nMonday - Tuesday - Wednesday\n","234":" ","235":" ","236":"\n\nAfter the Storm – Horrors & more horrors. The stunt was partly successful – not what it should have been for two reasons – it was a silent stunt & no artillery was used – a dog barking at our patrols also gave the show away & we practically ran into a hornets nest – The Boys fought gamely & well in spite of the hail of lead from machine guns – They went over at daylight on Monday morning & got half the village 0f \"Doigniel” & surprised many Fritzs having breakfast – some of the boys actually tore into Fritz's hot coffee & sausages – but couldn't stand the black bread. Good few Prisoners came thro big numbers of Fritzs killed. Regimental Bearers with the assistance of a few volunteers, said could manage, so we opened up an Aid Post & it took us fellows all we knew to keep it clean, we worked like Trojans – or rather 4 squads did – other squads either got the wind up their trousers or were pointing, at any rate Windsor, Feint, Collins & self were\n\nthe only squad who hung on without relief, all the other Bearers said that we should get special credit. Probably between the 56th & the 55th on out right we have handled some 500 cases. The 56th were relieved on Monday night by 54th – but us Bearers had to keep pegging away. 5 Regimentals 56th & 3 Regimental Stretcher Bearers of the 54th were seriously wounded – not a one of us got a scratch – although we were in many tight corners, our first case we lifted was under very heavy fire & later while away our little shelter was knocked sideways & Adrian Feint's blanket torn to threads. Am writing this 9 pm, back at Buigny – what a relief – no sleep since Saturday night, not too much tucker – nothing hot for days – our feet were wet the whole time, if we had not came in we surely would have trench feet. We suffered Hell with the weather as we have had about six seasons, from blizzards & gales of 50 miles an hour – rain – hail – sleet – some of the wounded actually cried with the cold. It was almost beyond endurance. Surely Hell is no worse than France. War & its horrors.\n\nAmen\n","237":" 1917\n\nRelieved at all Posts by 1st Division & their Ambulance. We marched back to Bapaume & stopped the night at the Main Dressing Station. Had a good nights sleep – also hot tea & stew. Dull day, but fine. Saw a Taut brought down.\n","238":"\n\nDull day but fine – Packed up all our Amb stuff & it nearly broke our hearts to learn that instead of going for the Divisional spell which has long been promised us – we have to set to and build a rest station between Beaulencourt & Bapaume. Had rather a heavy day.\n","239":"\n\nRaining & snowing. Rigging tents etc, more horrors etc. At 6.30 pm a mail was announced – what a difference it makes to a blokes spirits – I got letters from Annie – Eileen – Jess Hagan – Lill – Kit & Gert – Maud Single & papers & letters from Mabel Evans. As our mail is still closed cannot write at present. About 7.30 pm muster parade of Bearers, were advised to go to bed for rest as we would probably be called out to assist the 1st Field Ambulance about midnight, needless\n\nto add there was much moaning, as we never got other Ambulances to assist us.\n","240":" 1917\n\nNice sunny day. Church of England had a compulsory church parade – No R.C. Services offering – Rigging Tents etc., anything but a rest. Fortunately for us the stunt was postponed & we were not called out. \nOn parade the Adjutant asked for the names of our squad who stuck to our post\n - I daresay that is all we will hear of it.\n","241":"\n\nVery cold – rain & snow. Squaring up Tents etc all day. At 11.30 pm we the Bearers were – pulled out – pulled down enough tents for one Section, ordered to be in readiness to move off & assist at some part of the line.\n","242":"\n\nBlowing a treat – several snowstorms. Bitterly cold. Still holding ourselves in readiness. Got Official news that 1st Division took 150 Prisoners and the Villages of Hermies, Boursier & Demicourt.\n\nThe 3rd Army north of Arrar, took 10,000 prisoners & advanced to a depth of three miles – The Canadians assisted in taking Vimy Ridge.\n","243":"\n\nBoisterous – Rain & Snowstorms night & day. Squaring up the Camp – The order still to be in readiness. 4th Div – we heard took several Villages. But were repulsed with losses. Had a bit of a sing song at night – one of the Boys found a Mandolin in one of the Villages and as there are many players we have some fairly good music.\n","244":"\n\nDull to raining – a little snow – last nights fall of snow was the heaviest for a long time. Odd jobbing about the Camp – We have not been called out yet – but we are still in readiness. Got a letter from Bob Plummer.\n","245":"\n\nRather a nice day – sunny all day. Just fatiguing about the Camp. General\n\nBirdwood decorated many of the Rank and file of our Division at H.Q.\n","246":"\n\nCold – Raw day – a little rain. Just doing jobs about the Camp. Heavy Artillery firing.\n\nX Easter Sunday X 15\/4\/17\n\nDrizzling rain all day. Helping to make shelter for our transport horses. Stan DClatke & I went up late in the evening to Irish Guards Canteen – just outside of La Fransloy & we bought for our mess about 100 Francs worth of tinned Sausages – Coffee & Milk – biscuits etc, we thought it was Xmas again. At daylight we got orders to be ready to move out at a moments notice – we found out later that units such as A.S.C. got orders to remove to Albert – because Fritz counter attacked the 1st &","247":" Divisions, he came over in mass formation 17 deep – he attacked & counter attacked six times – on one occasion he took 2 Villages from us & captured a lot of our guns – waggons etc – In a final dash our Boys not only got the Villages, guns & waggons back, but took 200 prisoners & two other Villages – Our Division went out to\n\nreinforce, but before they got to supports were told they were not required, needless to say we are all much relieved. The Irish Guards advanced 1,000 yds on our right.\n","248":"\n\nRain – Heavy wind & snowstorms. Camp duties. I went over through Ligny Thilloy & down near to Factory Corner, looked well over what was No Mans Land in the middle of November – Many Australians still lay here unburied – I could not find any trace of the identification of Hubert O'Kelly, who I am sure fell just about there. My pal Les Bowden who was looking for a friend, had the very good fortune to identify him by some papers strewn, about, amongst which was a letter of his written to him, Pte Margery. Les discovered in burying him that he still had his wristlet watch on his arm which was under him. I have written to the Registrar of Graves asking him to recognize a cross I place in that vicinity to Hubert's memory, if no further particulars are offering about him.\n","249":"\n\nRain – snow and wind. Very heavy bombardment all around our Sector, we got news that British & Canadians made a big push at Arras – taking Vimy Ridge & some 14000 prisoners & many batterys of 9 point 2 Guns & much ammunition, which was used to good advantage on Fritz. Also that the French below us captured 10,000 Prisoners in a big push at Rheims. Fritz still shells Bapaume with a long distance Naval Gun – most of them are duds. Wrote a lot of letters to get them away as the mail is due out.\n","250":"\n\nDrizzling rain & sleet. Got a Furphy that we may possibly be relieved off this front by Spring troops. Got news that Lens & other Villages are in flames & now in our hands – St Quentin we hear is being out flanked & likely to fall any time. Surely Fritz can't stand too many weeks like last one.\n","251":"\n\nDull to drizzling rain. Not much doing so I pushed off across country, to see if I\n\nfind any trace of Hubert O'Kelly, I put in most of the day on my mission but was not successful. Noticed unburied a runner & a Signaller – nothing to show which batt. The whole thing although heart rending and disgusting, yet interesting from a military point – you can grasp at a glance the idea of the charge – their objective etc., the locality – is something like this\n\nNote From Beaulencourt to Royal Engineers Survey Post across country would be 3 miles – From Bapaume 4 miles – From Ligny Thilloy 1½ miles – undoubtedly Hubert Fell in the Circle representing the top of a ridge & no mans land. I would like to put up a cross, about 50 yards from either the\n\nR.E. Survey Post or the big mound where some dozen Tommys are buried.\n\nAt sundown, we got orders that Fritz was counter attacking very savagely.\n","252":"\n\nDull – but fine – How pleased we all were we had not to go out & assist last night – The Artillery must have put the acid on Fritz – for our Boys held him at bay & cut him up severely in all his counter attacks. Got orders to move off at a minutes notice. Cleaned up the Beaulencourt Camp & were relieved by the 30th Fld Amb 11th Div Duke of Westminster about 11 am. Marched without any dinner through Bapaume – down the Albert Road past Le Sars & turned off across country just before we hit Pozierres & made for the Bazentin Camp, where we arrived about 4 pm, we probably done some 9 miles, but were delayed owing to waiting on our Infantry & congestion of traffic. Quite a treat to be marching away from the noise of guns & the many stand to orders (up the firing line line with the best of luck etc.). One day last week after a lot of digging & trouble, I unearthed\n\na very fine Latin Roman Missile from the Beaulencourt Church, and owing to the absence of R.C. Padres to whom I intended to present, as it was in such splendid order, I only had one course open & that was to burn it.\n","253":"\n\nFine day but cloudy. Marched off about 11 am after the Infantry for Becourt, where we arrived about 2\/30 pm – Very nice camp – good clean Huts – good water laid on, quite a treat after shell hole water.\n\nStan Clarke & I went for a walk around the Beaucourt Chateau & toward the Cemetery where a good sprinkling of Australians are laid side by side with the pick of the English troops, such as Black Watch – North H. Fusileers & many other crack regiments, who were the first to fall early in August 1915 – Fritz dug in about here first, after being driven back from Amiens & through Albert.\n","254":"\n\nVery nice day, but cold & windy. Got orders to march back to the Fricourt Camp, where we will have a much bigger\n\ncamp & more ground. Last night about 10\/30 pm, we were all awakened by a Gas alarm & the wind was very favourable – although we are at present at least 11 miles, in a straight line from the firing line – yet we heard there was danger as it was supposed to be the heaviest cloud gas launched for a long time. So far our Division has had no results from same. We arrived at the Fricourt Camp about midday – we had much cleaning up to do.\n","255":"\n\n23\/4\/17 Nice fine day – but cold winds blowing. Instead of a long looked for spell which – we reckon we have well earned we find that very strict discipline is being enforced from today – all sorts of Drill & lectures on slackness – saluting etc. One brand new Officer actually told us, we were too slack for Active Service – although at the same time news of what we have been doing is being flashed to all parts of the world. Colonel Horn & Adjutant Bullin went on leave leaving Major Chelchea in charge.\n","256":"\n\nNice sunny day, but cold wind blowing. Captain Young is in charge of C. Section. Heavy drill all day – mostly doubling on the hard roads – which has made our feet very sore – after being so used to the mud and water. Good news coming in from all parts of the line.\n","257":"\n\nCloudy but fine – Very cold at night. Our section on fatigue in transport lines, all fatigues ceased at 11 am, & we had the rest of the day to ourselves – many played foot ball etc. I immediately struck out across country to Pozierres to try & find Percy Singles grave. Made a careful search all around Pozierres – Moqouet Farm & the Windmill. I was not successful in finding his grave unfortunately. Pozierres in my opinion is beyond recognition, not even the usual heaps of bricks, etc. Two very fine wooden Crosses about 15 feet high are being erected one to 1st Division A.I.F. & the other 20th Battallion. Got home about 6\/30 pm very tired.\n\nIn order to celebrate Anzac Day etc, we C. Section brought out a paper, with the title of \"The Somme Chat” a real live paper, it consisted of some very fine Articles & puns on Officers & men & things in general. We expect other Sections to come out with one now & hit us off.\n","258":"\n\nVery nice day – Drilling all day – Good war news coming thro to us – some 80 Aeroplanes have been brought down this week – Very heavy bombardments on our front – Our Boy's 4th Division got as far as the Hindenburg line, but were driven back not being strong enough. Several pitched Battles in the open.\n","259":"\n\nVery nice day – Section went for a route march to Meaulte. Good news still comes in from our front, of more Aeroplanes & Prisoners.\n","260":"\n\nVery nice day. On Picquet – Complemented on the way we turned out. General Hough gave us a surprise visit. Wrote to Mrs O'Kelly, M Single & Eileen. Big mail in but never got any.\n","261":"\n\nVery nice day. Lined up after parade for Voting – Legislative Assembly.\n","262":"\n\nRather a hot day – Went down to Fricourt and had a bath. Got the afternoon off & went into Albert, all the Estaminets have been closed by the Military for some reason – so was disappointed at not being able to get a good feed. Went to the Anzac Coves Show at night & quite enjoyed it – not too bad.\n","263":"\n\nVery hot & sunny. Drilling & many lectures, Gas etc.","264":" & 14th F. Ambulance called back up the line – cant make out how we missed.\n\nWednesday 2\/5\/17\n\nSunny & hot – all fatigues & drill ceased at 11.30 am. Had the day off, running off heats etc for Divisional sports. We had wrestling on horse back – pillow fighting etc. I won my first heat in the wrestling although I was nearly pulled to pieces.\n","265":"\n\nNice day – fairly warm. Drilling all day. Had a tug of war and a game of football at night. We hear our Boys are being counter attacked very fiercely by Fritz and nearly all open fighting – Got letters from Aunty Lyons – Gert & Kit Nock.\n","266":"\n\nNice sunny day – Semi finals of the Divisional sports – 15th F. Amb. Well represented & scoring well. On Picquet all day.\n","267":"\n\nHot – dusty day. Divisional Sports continued some very fine performances put up by the Boys – running & jumping. Turned very windy and cold after tea – Got orders to march out at 10\/30 pm – motor cars picked us up, run us over to \"Veaux”, where we arrived about 2-30 am – were told that we would hardly be called out till daylight, so we tried to have a camp under an awning, but it was that dusty windy & cold – one couldn't sleep. We hear awful tales about the number of\n\n7th 8th & 14th men that are either killed or wounded.\n","268":"\n\nCold but fine & windy. Got orders to march to the lines about mid day. Relieved 1st 7th & 5th Field Ambulance about dusk. 7th had some heavy casualtys – 14th had 45 killed or wounded 5th also got a rough time – I heard N. Hill got a nice blighty on the hand and knee.\n\nTwo of our fellows got knocked badly before we reached our destination. Went up to R.A.P. on the Bullecourt front, which is in a sunken Road – under observation – no cover – we all admit this is the limit & the hottest joint we have yet struck. Gordon Highlanders and Devons came in on our left. Fritz observed them changing over & gave us particular Hell. Going our very hardest all night. Had a good squad – B. Trail, P. McMahon, E. Hand & self. We hope that the luck which we have always had will stick to us.\n","269":"\n\nClear sunny day. Jocks & Devons & our 1st Division went over at 4 am after a very heavy & terrifying barrage. Fritz replies very savagely. Prisoners came thro from\n\ndaylight to the number of about 300. Jock joined up with 9th Battalion, after taking 4 lines of trenches, and combined they have driven a big wedge thro Hindenburg line. Fritz gave us particular hell all day – several of our Bearers on another post got knocked. We had many pieces of shrapnel hit us but never broke any skin.\n","270":"\n\nCloudy day – but fairly clear. Fritz very savage, gave us everything he had in stock. Carrying all night & day. This joint is easily the hottest that ever we have been in & we all think – surely a man is a freak to go through this Valley of Death as it were. Fritz not content with throwing all sorts of corruption at us on our open mission, he was sniping us from daylight till midday – we often gave him the benefits of any doubts as to sniping at Bearers – but to day was unpardonable & well meant – a \nprisoner freely admitted he had received orders to shoot at everything\n. Poor old Reg Woods got a nice blighty, got a nice little piece of H.E. in the thigh just missed the Femoral artery. 8 other Bearers knocked, but mostly slight,\n\nat 7 pm Fritz put over a very heavy barrage & caught a Mills Bomb dump about 150 yds from us – immediately there was a cry of Stretcher Bearers – Mick Shean – E. Hand – C. Griese & self doubled down & had to pull out 7 fellows who were all badly cut about – what with the Shrapnel over head & the exploding bombs – we all expected to go up any minute. Repeatedly saw two Infantry men throw themselves forward with a sandbag in front of them & toss boxes of bombs away – some \nsay V.C.'s have been given for less\n - I have noticed many brave deeds done during the last few days, but all done as a duty & no hope of any recognition. Suffice to say as a fitting finale, my squad came thro without a scratch & I don't think I ever said a more fervent little prayer of thanksgiving. We were relieved by 3rd F.A. about 10.30 pm we marched back to \"Veaux” where Capt Minty very kindly arranged to take us up in motor buses to a Camp consisting of a few tents on the road to Bapaume on the left of \"Favielle”, we rolled in dog tired about 4.45 am – and had the first decent sleep since Friday night.\n","271":"\n\nSlept till midday – then got up & had some dinner. Raining all night – cleaned up slightly in the afternoon – Bert Trail and I went for a stroll through the Village of \"Faurelle”. Our Division seems to be moving up – so expect we shall have to go in again. Got a Gas alarm about 2 am but nothing eventuated. Fritz shelling the Main Dressing Station all day & night, several motor cars blown to pieces – one Sergeant killed & many injured. Heard Fritz had retaken \"Fresnoy”, having used some new Gas on the Canadians.\n","272":"\n\nVery warm – dull to drizzling rain. We are camped alongside an Aerodrome and it is most interesting watching the Planes ascend & descend. Wrote a long letter to Aunty Lyons. Colonel Manifold & the A.D.M.S. addressed all the Bearers of the different Field Ambulances, he said he conveyed the highest compliments from General Gough & General Birdwood about the way we worked under heavy fire\n\nand the evacuation of wounded was the best on record etc. etc., we did feel some brave kids. Had some fine old games of football – cockfighting – one would never have thought we had been so fagged only a few hours previously. Drizzling rain all night.\n","273":"\n\nVery hot & fine. Left the Camp for the line at 6 am arrived at our posts about 11 am. Main Dressing Station shifting two miles nearer Bapaume. Very heavy artillery bombardment – as we are posted in a sunken road, of which Fritz has the exact range – needless to add he gives us a terrible time and one does not care to venture out unless on duty. Very busy night & day.\n\nSaturday 12th-5-1917\n\nVery hot and fine. Went up further to a sunken road where the 58th R.A.P. is – as we are under observation from Bullecourt & Riencourt on the Hill to say nothing of the Heights of Cambrai\n\nand observation baloons, it is hard to believe what Fritz treats us to in crossing the open, truly some spiritual being must guide our steps thro the many barrages of wild and savage H.E. Shrapnel. The air seems full of flying missiles, we can hear our shells on their downward course to Fritz perhaps 1,000 yds away.\n\nAbout 8 pm I was nearly knocked senseless and thought I had been kicked by a very heavy type of horse – I was carrying a patient at the time, I hastily pulled myself together & found my head bleeding, a big piece of shrapnel had knocked a big hole in my steel helmet, I have a lump on my head the size of an egg. I stuck to duty – although I was foolish and Capt Young or Capt Beard would easily have given me a blighty ticket – if I had been less honest – all I had to say was that I couldn't carry on & had a headache, but I couldn't pretend and really did feel alright, all the boys said I lost\n\nmy chance of swinging it, I am sorry now I didn't, when I see the fellows that are going thro swinging the lead. About \n6\n of our fellows got slight wounds and all went off duty. 58th Battalion had a very successful hop over at daylight & brought in nearly 300 prisoners – some say they have Fritz pushed out of the Hindenburg line & once again in the shell holes on the flat below Bullecourt. About 9 pm we were recalled back to another post and we had to go through absolutely the fiercest barrage we have yet been in, we were forced nearly ¾ of a mile out of our way, for a while I lost my pal Bert Trail, but I was so pleased when he caught me up again in a trench which we had to shelter in for about half an hour. Had no tucker and very little water all day. 3rd London Division came in to relieve us but only half of them got through the barrage & they were badly cut up. The Tommys were very sore when they saw our position\n\nthey said, we will never hold it, as you are out too \nbleeding far\n. We went back about to the Reserves about midnight.\n","274":"\n\nVery hot – We were relieved by","275":" &","276":" F. Amb. – went back to Main Dressing Station about two miles from Bapaume, where we arrived at midday – got a square feed & plenty of hot tea. Had a bit of a clean up – shave & an apology for a Bath. I got another crack on the shoulder coming out but it didn't hurt nor cut the flesh – I really do not think Fritz will knock me now – Without a doubt as the Doctors all say my case is another one in favour of the steel lids – undoubtedly they proved friendly to me & in future will never treat them with such contempt. I must admit my nut was fairly sore last night & all day today – It is healing fast & I had a dose of Anti Tet – S – I forgot all about my little grievances when I found 9 letters awaiting me from Mrs Hill, Annie, May, Mrs Single, Gert Nock, Kit, Lill & Les hagan – it was great to get such news from good old pals. Gas alarm at night. Had a good sleep & pleasant dreams after the nice letters.\n","277":"\n\nRained heavy all night.
