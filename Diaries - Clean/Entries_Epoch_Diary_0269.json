It is rumoured that we move soon to a sector of this front.\n\n \n","14":"\n\nThe weather is still bitterly cold and today we moved to Albert where we were billeted in the old girls school. We are going into the line near Martinfuchs and forming an H.D.S. at Bazentin le Petit.\n","15":"\n\nAt Albert still but weather still freezing. Fritz has shelled the town today but I have heard of no casualties. I go on leave on 29th so cant see much use in going up to the line.\n","16":"\n\nMarch from Albert to Bazentin ADS & from there up to the line on the left of Flers & in front of High Wood.

Fritz caught a big ammunition dump & from reports he caused considerable damage. Great clouds of smoke roll over the hills a few miles away, and the explosions are almost continuous.\n","32":"\n\nEverything on the front is very quiet & casualties few.

Beautiful day & the sky larks are going their hardest. Move tomorrow to Bapaume.\n","72":"\n\nOut of the Somme & once more in Pas de Calais. We moved from Bazentin via Flers, Le Roque Tilloy to Bapaume. This town now 7 miles remote from the line is in a very battered condition & is still shelled by Fritz. About the size of Albert but it seems a better class of town. Guns can be distinctly heard. The neighbouring country is not in a bad state at all. M.D.S.\n","73":"\n\nTonight we were ordered up to the line & we went up to the A.I.S. on the Cambrai Road. The country here is fine & not much at all marked by shellfire.\n","74":"\n\nEarly this morning we moved forward again & have been bearing all the morning. The infantry this morning took Hermes & as usual there are a good number of casualties. The bearing here is not bad but the carries are long, but over good country all cultivation paddocks.

Dean Fry was killed this morning on our right.\n","75":"\n\n Still up the line working in front of Hermes. The casualties of yesterday have all come in, in all about 300 from 2nd Batt, too great a percentage. Things are very quiet. We are now on the famous Hindenburg line & a few miles ahead are the Cambrain Hills which look very adaptable for defence. In the direction of Arras heavy bombarding is in progress & rumour says that Verny ridge has been taken with many guns & prisoners. \n\nStill bad & changeable weather. A German M.G. was brought in today.\n","76":"\n\nYesterday Harry Bladin Roger Pemberton & Lochrary were caught by a shell & Harry was badly wounded & the others got blighties. We have move back to a dugout in reserve area but another stunt is expected shortly. Another snow storm this afternoon.\n","77":"\n\nNothing doing. Weather still very fickle with rain sleet snow & shine.\n\nMail.\n","78":"\n\nThis morning we moved to 3rd Battn R.A.P. & there built a dugout to make ourselves comfortable. In the evening, without sleeping in our dugout, we had to move up with the R.A.P. to a quarry a few hundred yards behind the outposts. There was a stunt & an advance of about 600 yards & only two casualties. Beautiful day.\n","79":"\n\nAnother beautiful day & we in the quarry. Absolutely nothing doing. Great news comes from Arras way where apparently the push has commenced in earnest. Guns & prisoners galore.\n\nMurcoing is a town in front of us now.\n","80":"\n\nEarly this morning Fritz attacked our left & bombarded our pozzy very heavily but no casualties resulted. His attack was a complete failure & his casualties heavy. Ours were slight.

Rain snow & shine.\n","83":"\n\nNothing at all eventful. Making dugouts in the mud and rain. Rotten wet day. It appears that the capture of Hermies is one of the greatest feats the Australians have to their credit as it was far more strongly defended than anticipated but our chaps say that Fritz does not know the value of his machine guns. Our line is very weakly held but quite strongly enough to give Fritz a very\n","84":"\n\nbad time in his two counter attacks, one to-day in which he was worse off than that of 16th. Weather raining still. One of our planes the latest spud, accounted for two enemy baloons this morning.\n","85":"\n\nMove back for a couple of days spell.\n\nEverything we hear of Fritz’s last attack points to the seriousness of it. He captured 22 guns & 16 MG’s & on the counter attack five of the 18 pdrs were found destroyed & no MG’s recovered. However his casualties were very heavy. One chap with accounted for 80 & is recommended for a V.C.\n","86":"\n\nChateau at Velu built by Marquis de Covronnel in 1719.\n\nWalk round the chateau of Velu & the grounds which once were beautiful but are now the scene of much vandalism on the part of the Germans. Here the River has its source & we bathed in it this morning.\n","87":"\n\nPlenty of aerial work this morning & Fritz very daringly came very low & destroyed one of our balloons. The division is to be relieved tomorrow & the rumour is that we go to Belgium. This evening many aerial combats took place in which one Fritz plane was destroyed & came down in our lines. Very fine sight.\n","88":"\n\nRelieved from the line & march back to Bapaume via Lebuquiere. Beautiful day.\n","89":"\n\nMarch back to Pozieres where we expect to stay a couple of days before we go back further. Tomorrow Anzac Day is to be celebrated & we are going to have a ‘beano’.

We are just outside the village Vaulx-Vraucourt. Apparently there have been a good number of casualties including ambulance men. The result of the attack is that a wedge has been driven into the Hindenburg line.\n\nBeautiful day.\n","101":"\n\nLast night we moved up to the line just behind Riencourt, where a heavy battle is in progress. All night Fritz put up a terrific bombardment & continued it into this morning when I was numbered among the casualties which are very heavy. I think the casualties are heavier also the shelling than at Pozieres.\n","102":"\n\nThrough the ordinary channels to & then in Hospital train.\n","103":"\n\nTo St Johns Ambulance Brigade Hospital at Etaples.\n","104":"\n\nStill at St Johns Ambulance Brigade Hospital where we are having glorious weather.

The 1st Div advance about a mile with only 2000 odd casualties.","208":" Field Amb had 26.\n","209":"\n\nArrive at unit at Steenvoorde to find only nursing section here.

Peterson, failed to find him\n","212":"\n\nThere is certainly a war in progress on the Ypres front & ambulance casualties are usually at about 30% to 50% equally as heavy as infantry.\n\nThe bombardments are very violent & these moonlit nights favour nightly aerial work on both sides.\n","213":"\n\nAnother walk to Cassel & back by the great moonlight which we are enjoying now. The weather has been glorious while here, fine days & moonlit nights.\n\nWe are moving up to A.D.S. tomorrow. The artillery fire has been very intense of late\n","214":"\n\nMove from Steenvoorde to Dickebusch partly by foot & partly by motor through Poperinghe Camp for a while in Buren Chateau where we were in the centre of a Fritz bombing stunt.\n","215":"\n\nMove up to the line through Ypres on the Menin road where the fighting lately has been very severe. The ground is broken up very much & the roads back are lined with dead men & animal. The shelling just now is moderate.\n","216":"\n\nVery busy day on left of Menin Road at R.A.P. & other posts. The system of practice barrages is being adopted two very heavy ones daily taking place. Fritz counter attacked tonight & his barrage was very heavy. Held up by it for about two hours. Post is being heavily shelled & it is decided to move it up to safer position. A battery blown out above us. \n","217":"\n\nMove back to Dickebush through Ypres. Pass the ruins of Cloth Hall & other buildings. No building has more than a few bricks left to mark it. I suppose this battle will be called","218":" Battle of Ypres or Menin Road. Another attack takes place tomorrow & elaborate preparations are being made for it\n\nFrom accounts it will be the final objective of the battle the ridge commanding a great amount of flat country & hazards any coastal enterprises of Fritz. The dead in horses & men is enormous, especially well back\n\nThursday 4\n\nMove back through Ypres to Nestock ridge & thence to forward posts of the new advance. It has been raining & the place has been converted into a veritable quagmire. \n\nThe advance this morning was entirely successfull & to-nights counter attack was repulsed.

We are due for a stunt in the morning but the more important part of it is on our left to the sea.\n","223":"\n\nThe result of this mornings stunt is successful. The artillery on our side is very active but Fritz is comparatively silent. In a great air duel one Fritz decended in flames & one of ours came down. The airman came through our post but was dead. From the artillery just now 6 p.m. a counter attack is in progress.\n","224":"\n\nMove back to about 4 Kilos north of Poperinghe. What is exactly in the wind I know not but rumour has it that we move from this area.\n\nThe Australian part of this last stunt was a great success & now all the high ridge commanding all the surrounding country is in our hands.\n\nThe treatment the 1st Field meets out to its men is anything than a credit to the unit regards food, clothes & general.\n","225":"\n\nThe weather we are now having gives evidence of the rapid approach of winter, raining off & on daily.\n\nVisit Poperinghe & see Eric Greenwell. Poperinghe is much the same as last year but in darkness. Enemy aerial activity\n","226":"\n\nVisit Rininghilst.

The post is located in a cordial factory & is fairly shell proof. Fritz has been shelling very heavily about here with very big stuff. The day has been fine & cares few so except for the magnetism of the place things aren’t bad.\n","240":"\n\nA carry last night brought us back along the Ypres to Zonnebeke road where we have been in a fine big pill box for the day. Shelling heavy. Very few casualties.\n","241":"\n\nStill at R.H.Q. on Zonnebeke Road near Fryenberg. Very few cases are coming through though the shelling in the back areas is very heavy including many gas shells. One carry to the Canadian aid post was very warm. Fritz is getting on to our batteries after news of German offensive on Italy.\n","242":"\n\nHeavy gas attack last night by shelling. A carry through it and a fall into a shell hole were the nights episode.\n\nA Canadian attack this morning at about 6 am resulted in the Canadians obtaining all objectives in vicinity of Paschendale ridge. Relieved this afternoon by third F.A. & come back to Lille Gate.\n","243":"\n\nWill’s birthday. A beautiful day in Ypres at Lille Gate where things are very quiet. The Canadians still hang to the positions they took yesterday\n","244":"\n\nAn ordinary day at Lille Gate.\n\nMore disconcerting news from Italy\n","245":"\n\nA trip to Poperinghe for the day\n","246":"\n\nNothing at all to record.\n\nTuesday 6\n\nA very hot carry down from Zonnebeke, perhaps hottest I have yet had.

The town is a fair size\n","258":"\n\nNothing of special interest. Move most likely tomorrow in the direction of Bolougne\n","259":"\n\nNo move to-day on account of the inability to find billets. Our officers (some) showed some very gentlemanly conduct last night en route from Bolougne\n","260":"\n\nMove from Ecuire to a farm house between Coursel & Course near Desures, Sainer & about 20 kilos from Bolougne.

Another heavy frost.\n","277":"\n\nAnother fine day & cold.\n\nThis afternoon I took a train ride from Pont des Briques to Hardelot on the sea, south of Boulogne. It is a fine watering place with a nice beach, tiled promenade, tennis courts etc. The houses are modern \nbillets\n villas and look very nice.\n\nThe wood, planted in the dunes is fine & mostly of pine trees. On the route is an old castle where Henry VIII lived while the Field of the Cloth of Gold was on. A fine old house in Pont des Briques is where Napoleon 1st planned his Austerlitz Campaign 1805-6.\n\nIn fact the whole place abounds in historical interest.

Bagpipes, songs etc are the orders and it has eventually ended at midnight with \"Old Lang Syne\" & an orgy. I myself am O.K. & have put a few of them to bed. The officers lost any \nspark\n of dignity they ever possessed. Welcomed the men into the mess for the New Year.\n\nWhen I look back at 1917 I find it has been adventurous & educating. The winter on the Somme was bad enough & the Battles of Bullicourt & Ypres rank among the most severe on the front. Two trips to England have in me satisfied a great desire to see & as well as possible that country.\n\n"}}
