is the custom in France to kiss everyone you meet on New Year’s day, (not a bad custom if there are plenty of girls about). No route march this morning, had to do cleaning up round the billets instead. Spread & concert held in large room at an estaminet here, a great success. Plenty of eatables etc, & the concert was also very well catered for. Had a real good time altogether.\n","2":"\nOn water fatigue all day, we had to fill the water cart in the morning & evening, it is a very monotonous job with only one bucket dipping out of a well over 300 feet deep. There was a big mail in today. I got eight letters some papers & a parcel, but owing to the parcel being on the journey a long time, nearly all the contents were spoilt. Received orders that we are moving again tomorrow.\n","3":"\nReveille was at 6.30 this morning & my word it was cold getting out of bed. Fell in at 8 am & marched to Cardonette a distance of about 12 miles, both of my heels were blistered & my feet were aching very much. We are billeted in the place where C Section were. This is a very poor town. Playing cards until 10 pm. A good few of the boys overdid it by getting drunk again tonight.\n","4":"\nParaded to Major Bently to see if I could be taken on to Ribemont by motor, as my feet are still very sore, (successful). Left Cardonette about 8.45 am & arrived at Ribemont at 10 am. It was raining coming along, & was very cold. We are again billeted in one of the store rooms of the flower mill here, but I only have one flight of stairs to climb now. Feeling out of sorts all day.\n","5":"\nA fine day all day. On water fatigue, only had two water carts to fill. We had to pump the water out of a well, so it didn’t take long to fill a cart. There are plenty of German prisoners working in this town, they are chiefly employed sweeping the mud & slush off the roads, also general maintenance of same. Went for a bath in the afternoon to the Corps Baths at Healey, (about two miles away) but as the water was either too hot or too cold I came back nearly as dirty as I went, anyhow I got as exchange of clothes. Trying to get a position as motor car orderly on one of the ambulance cars.\n","6":"\nWent up to Brigade dump this morning to guard our things we dumped befor leaving for Vignacourt. As all the things were shifted by two oclock, this evening we came back again. Saw Bill Freeman & Clive Dwyer in the afternoon. To break the monotony I went with a couple of others to a vaudeville show here, it was very good & we had quite an enjoyable evening. The performers were out of the Tommy Army Service Corps. Some are professionals I think.\n","7":"\nReveille was at 6.30 am this morning. Everyone was very busy packing up. Fell in 8 am & marched to Mametz, a distance of about ten miles, it was very muddy coming along the road & exceptionally muddy here, very deep in places. A fine day, the best we have had for a long time. Detailed as one of the two cooks for A Section, as the Sergeant said I was too light as a stretcher bearer. Raining tonight. We are camped in huts here, which are perfectly dry (board floors).\n","8":"\nRaining this morning. Also a very strong cold wind blowing. Left Mametz at 9 am and marched to Longueval, a distance of about 5 miles. The roads are very muddy, & we were held up a couple of times on account of very heavy traffic. We are billeted in huts at the dressing station where we were before. Great improvements have been carried out since we were here before, duck boards everywhere, water laid on & places remodelled. Detailed as assistant cook to A Section. Fritz put a few shells on a hill about half a mile away, one went right amongst some horses.\n","9":"\nThere are a good few guns around us here, they are firing unceasingly day & night. Fritz has kept very quiet all day, he put over a few shells early this morning. Have a very light job at the cook house, only having to keep a tank full of water. It is very cold carrying the water though, we have to carry it about two hundred yards. Feet very sore & aching. The twelfth Field Ambulance are in charge here this time. We (bearers of the 4th) are attached to them, also the 13th Field bearers, cooks, & transport.\n","10":"\nThe weather seems to be getting much clearer now. It was a sunny day nearly all day today. A couple of German airoplanes came over this afternoon but were soon sent back by our anti-aircraft guns. A few shells are still lobbing fairly close (close enough for me). Worked half a day in the cook house & have to go in all tonight. I am doing the night job permanently.\n","11":"\nFritz kept firing shells over this way nearly all night, most of them are bursting a good way away. Slept all day, I don’t know how things went on, very quiet though I think. Received a parcel from Doris, it was sent on October 10th & contained very useful articles. Snowing, during the afternoon & a good part of the night, but rain set in, & it thawed very quick. One thing a fellow can have very good food in the cook house, just for the cooking of it for yourself.\n","12":"\nVery foggy morning. Everything is very quiet. I am sleeping in a dug out by myself now, as there would be too much row in the hut for me to sleep during the day, it is very crampy though. There were not many shells over this way during the night.\n","13":"\nSnowing rather heavy very early this morning, but rain set in again & it thawed about 4 am. It was very cold after it had thawed. There is a Corporal on the night shift with me. We have to break up the bread for milk sop for breakfast, cook the bacon & cut it up, & make the breakfast. We can always have about two hours sleep during the night. There was a mail in today but never got any letters. It was also pay day as there is no place about here to spend any money, I never got mine.\n","14":"\nWe were rather late with breakfast, as we had porridge to make instead of sop. Church service was held in the Y.M.C.A. Tent. I could not go as I had to work. Everything is exceptionally quiet bar for an occasional shell the Germans put over.\n","15":"\nA very frosty morning. Exceptionally quiet everywhere. I don’t believe I have heard a gun go off yet this morning. The chilblains on my toes are aching very much. Fritz put a few shells very close during the night. The Corporal Cook has been transferred to day work & a private put in his place. Very Frosty night.\n","16":"\nEverything frozen this morning. Didn’t have much sleep during the day as fellows I met in England came to see me. Very quiet all day. Fritz put over his usual shells. There are a good few patients go through here, also a fair number of sick ones. Started snowing in the early part of the night. Very cold.\n","17":"\nStill snowing it is about eight inches deep now. The sight around here now is absolutely beautiful. There is plenty of snowballing going on, also building of snow men & huge snow balls. There has been a good few battles fought today between the different units that are here. Went to the dentist to have my teeth fixed up (want filling) but as I would be deprived of my daily sleep by waiting too long. I abandoned the idea & went to bed about 11 am. Fritz put some shells very close to my dug out. It was very pretty, watching them burst in the snow.\n","18":"\nSnowed again this morning. The snow is about ten inches deep now. Everything is very quiet this morning, a fellow can hardly realise he is within range of enemy shells, & that there is a war on. Things are pretty easy in the cook house now, as some of the men have gone back to Mametz Wood.\n","19":"\nStopped snowing. The snow is still on the ground yet & everything is frozen. There hasn’t been a mail in from N.S.W. or Queensland for about three weeks now. I am waiting anxiously for some parcels & letters. exceedingly cold night.\n","20":"\nIt is very hazy & very very cold this morning, I can hardly hold my pen to write. As we are to go up in the trenches tomorrow, I have been packing my pack, which will be left behind until we come out again. As things have now changed we are not to go up to the trenches, but back to Becordel (Anzac Rest Camp). We are in favour of the latter.\n","21":"\nWorked all night & until 8 am this morning. Very busy packing up until 9.30. Fell in 10 am & marched to Becordel, a distance of about 7 miles. We are camped in marquee tents here. The whole Rest Camp is all tents. Snow is still laying on the ground. All the mud & pools are frozen as hard as rocks, just as well too as it will be terrible muddy when it thaws. There are duck boards everywhere. Went down through the cemetary here. There are a couple of fellows I know buried there. My word there are a lot of graves there, Lines & Lines of wooden crosses.\n","22":"\nWe have reveille at 7 am breakfast at 7.30 fall in 8.30 am work till midday, dinner at 12.30 pm fall in 1.30 pm, work till 4 pm tea 4.30 pm. There is a rumour we will be here until the end of march. It is a camp of inconvenience, the cook house, Q.M. store, water tap, & latrines are all about 5 to 800 yards away in different directions. Cleaning up tents during the morning, putting another up on another site in the afternoon. Snowed during the afternoon & appears to continue. Hear heavy firing during the evening. This is about 9 miles behind the line.\n","23":"\nThe temperature was 14 degrees below zero today. There was a terribly cold north wind was blowing. Shifting a latrine, it took up nearly all day, as the ground was exceptionally hard to dig being frozen as hard as a rock. Informed that I was to start on night duty at the Buffet. Have to make cocoa for sick & wounded coming through the dressing station. It is a very easy job. I just have found that I left my souvenir belt behind at Longueval. Will go out & get it tomorrow.\n","24":"\nStill very cold. We have a good few patients come though here, some are very much wounded, one poor chap had his left leg & right shattered. Both were amputated upon arrival here. Went out to Longueval this morning got a ride in a motor lorry nearly all the way out, but walked all the way home, it is about 7 miles. Everything was very quite out there. German airoplanes have been coming over very frequently of late, our anti-aircraft guns fires hundreds of shells at them but without effect, as the German on nearly every occasion flies very high. Precautions have to be taken against the shrapnel & pieces of shell that fall after bursting in the air. We start work at 8.30 pm until 8.30 am, 12 hr shift. Change over every week. The sun was shining all day but the rays are not at all warming. Very cold wind blowing all day.\n","25":"\nMy word we have a good few patients go through here, including a great number of trench feet, & fellows with venerial disease. Not so cold today, or this evening, I suppose it is on account of no wind blowing. There are about 9 men go on leave during a week now.\n","26":"\nAll leave is now cancelled, reasons not stated. I suppose it will only be for a week or two. It was terrific cold here today, with a strong wind blowing. I haven’t a bad job at the Buffet.\n","27":"\nIt is still very cold with the northerly wind blowing. There is a fellow who plays the violin in our tent, so we have some music & a sing song nearly every evening. It helps to pass away the time. Sounds of a very heavy bombardment from early in the morning until well into the day, no word of any attack yet though. We were very much rushed with patients last night, 78 being put through in a couple of hours. Word has just come through that the 29th Division went over last night, took 2 lines of trenches & 600 prisoners.\n","28":"\nWe are getting very poor food here & C. Section paraded to the O.C. who said that the bacon was to be fried instead of boiled & we are to receive porridge three times a week. Previously we only got cold boiled bacon & tea for breakfast, stew & tea for dinner, rice or sago & tea for tea. Dry rations consisted of bread, jam, cheese, & sometimes butter, which is no good for such a cold climate as this. As all the water pipes are frozen, water is now very scarce, & through the shortage I haven’t anything to do, but was put on undressing a dead man & sewing him up in a blanket, & watching over two more who were dying, one was gassed & the other two were badly knocked about. We have braziers burning in the tents here & get very black from the coal smoke.\n","29":"\nThe Germans put over a good few shells between here & in Albert. There was nobody hurt though. For the last few nights German airoplanes have been regular, but I think they are only scouting. The food has been altered according to the O.C’s orders of yesterday. The Porridge is very appreciated these cold mornings. The sun shines every day but there is still some snow on the ground & it is terrible cold still. I have seven blankets here therefore I have no need to sing out about the cold.\n","30":"\nSnowed lightly during the morning. We put through about 45 patients (average) during the night. Worked till 2 pm, being 18 hrs on so we are changing over to day work. It is much easier work in the day time than in the night. Not so cold as previous.\n","31":"\nOwing to all the water pipes etc being frozen here, we have to carry out water just on half a mile, & my word it is no good these cold windy mornings, carrying water. Had a great number of wounded through here this afternoon. There are a good few head wounds go through. One poor fellow had half his head blown off, he died later. Snowed fairly heavy last night.\n","32":"\nOne of the Battalions are renovating the receiving stations & the improvements will mean less work for us. Not so many patients through today & hardly any wounded at all. It was also much warmer today, but started to snow again tonight. Haven’t read a paper for about a couple of months now. Our artillery bombarded Fritz’s trenches every & nearly all night.\n","33":"\nOwing to the kitchen being shifted this afternoon everything was head over heels. Everything was very quiet during the day. A German airoplane came over this evening & dropped two bombs not too far away, close engh for my liking.\n","34":"\nHad a quiet morning, but was kept exceptionally busy this evening. We put through about seventy patients in about two hours, including 22 Scoties. There were four of the Scoties severly & dangerously wounded, it appears that two Coys were carrying \"Mills bombs\" in sand back, when the pin came out of a bomb & set the rest off. One was blown to pieces (he was due for a months furlough tomorrow through long service). The weather is getting much warmer, & the starlings are \nbeginning to\n arriving here in mobs too, a good sign of spring. There was a concert & a bit of a cinema held in the recreation hut tonight. I did not go.\n","35":"\nEach day that passes spring is noticeably coming very quick. Rather quiet all day. All stretcher cases (wounded) go right on to the Casualty clearing station, both by Railway & motor, this means less work for us C section of this ambulance & four out of a section had to go up to the Advance dressing station as reserve bearers for the stunt tonight. The","36":" Battalion went over at 9 pm & took their objective. The prisoners are said to have given themselves up very easily, some even had their blankets & overcoats rolled waiting to go over & meet our fellows to give themselves up, they declared they knew we were going to have a pop over, but did not know the time, & that they were utterly sick of the war, in all about 250 prisoners were taken. Both the 13th & 14th Battalions lost heavily through the German shell fire. Keeping very cold. Shifted into another tent in the opposite corner of the camp very convenient place.\n\nMonday February 5th\nThe 13th Batt are still holding what they took last night. Two counter attacks were beaten off. The 13th Field Ambulance also lost fairly heavy. \n\nThe improvements added to the \"receiving point\" are greatly appreciated by all. Not so cold today, snow still on ground, but it is gradually thawing.\n\nTuesday February 6th\nA terrible windy day. Very strong & cold direct northerly wind blowing. We never started work until 2 pm as we are again changing over from day shift to night shift. Had a terrible head ache this afternoon & after Captain Furber examined me, he ordered me back to bed, also gave me some medicine. Very bilious during the night, which necessitated my getting up three times & my word it was a very very very cold wind blowing, very strong too.\n\nWednesday February 7th\nAs this place has been altered to a Divisional rest station & M.D.S. we don’t get half the patients we previously got. Cold wind still blowing a gale today. Our tent was nearly blown away. Not felling so bad today. Have rather a bad cough though.\n","37":"\nReceived four letters by todays mail. Still very windy & cold. Things are very quiet here now. We have a good few patients through here with trench feet, pleurisy, Bronchitis etc. Fritz keeps coming over this way every night in his airoplane. He was flying very low last night, & fired a good few shots out of his machine gun on a road about three hundred yards away from here, but there was nothing there at the time. \nHe was fly\n \n\n500 is the principal card game in the tent, to pass time away.\n","38":"\nThe days are getting warmer now. It is quite a pleasure to sit out in the sun. Every night there is a heavy frost. We all dine in a mess hut here now, as there is no fire in there, it is very cold to eat in.\n","39":"\nAs ink has run out & unobtainable in this part of the world I have to fall back on the old led pencil. Things are keeping very quiet. As fast as patients are discharged out of the rest station here, others come in & fill their places.\n","40":"\nLeave to England started again yesterday but owing to heavy traffic on the French railways was cancelled again today. We now have a canteen of our own, all profits are to go to a mess fund. There has been a terrible lot of reinforcements go up towards the trenches this last week. A very warm night.\n","41":"\nVery warm dull day. Snowed slightly during the morning. Was informed that I wasn’t to go on duty tonight as I was appointed orderly in the mess hut. Went for a walk into Albert after tea, it was our intention to go to the cinema, but as there was such a big crowd there, we abandoned the idea. Owing to arrangements re mess orderly being cancelled I had to go on & work all night.\n","42":"\nWorking until 2 pm as we are changing over to day work. Snow thawing & ground is getting very muddy. The canteen calls out as soon as it gets a new stock in, trade is very brisk. We are now on a little over half rations of bread, the balance being dry biscuits.\n","43":"\nWe are having a considerable number of changes regarding Officers. Handed gas helmets in for examination. An examination will be held on such every Wednesday afternoon. Had a good few patients through during the day. Wrote three letters during the afternoon. Handed pay books in for new ones to be issued full particulars taken.\n","44":"\nThis last couple of days there has been a great number of 13th Btn men go through here with scabies. Saw Sid Cooper this evening, he informed me that all the fellows I know came through the stunt alright. He also spoke of the experience he went through. Beautiful day all day, the sun was quite warm for a change.\n","45":"\nOwing to Lance Corporal McGregor (in charge of \"receiving point)\" being promoted to Waggon Orderly Cpl, & taking over his duties as such, we now have another Lance Cpl in charge. We have a great deal of discipline in this camp now, blankets are to be rolled in a certain way, must be neat & level, then great coat, pack, steel helmet, gas respirator, & equipment must be put in regulation fashion, such to the desire of a well hated Major we have in our unit. Very easy day, had hardly any patients. Mail closed for Australia today. Rained during the afternoon.\n","46":"\nShowery rain nearly all day. Very foggy this afternoon & evening. Everywhere is very boggy. The Sergeant Cook here is as funny as a circus, if you call him Sergeant upon approaching him for anything, he will give you absolutely anything you require, but! Call him Copey (his name is Copeland) & you will get nothing but a growl, of course I always allude to him as sergeant.\n","47":"\nWe are getting very good food here, haven’t had stew for four days now, porridge every morning for breakfast. Very misty weather this last couple of days, showery rain during the day. Very easy job this last couple of days. Not feeling too good for about three weeks now.\n","48":"\nThrough the guy ropes of our tent getting wet by the rain & shrinking, we had quite an exciting time keeping it up until the pegs were driven in again. We haven’t had an Australian mail in for a long time now, There is a rumour we are shifting on Saturday.\n","49":"\nNearly flooded out of the tent today. Still keeping very wet. Had a couple of heavy showers of rain today. We are not changing over to night shift as it will not be worth while for the couple of days. A cobber out of this tent was promoted to sergeant dispenser today.\n","50":"\nVery quite all day. Only take 2nd division men in here now. Every available man in camp put on pulling up & relaying duck boards. The taps on the tanks & water carts have thawed which saves us a lot of trouble in handling the water.\n","51":"\nC. Section bearers moved out to Millencourt this morning, we are supposed to go on Saturday. The fourth division started to move out today. Rumor of us going back again to Belgium. Got heart burn very bad tonight. Very dull weather lately, there is a big fog \nnearly\n everyday.\n\nFriday February 23rd\nRumor we are to move out on Sunday. Had a very busy time between 1 pm and 4 pm. The difference regarding numbers of patients between the 2nd &","52":" division cannot pass unnoticed, the former has a great number more. Trod on a rusty nail, & my foot is aching very much.\n","53":"\nVery sore heel. Had it dressed in the morning & afternoon, also had a 500 Anti tetanus injection this evening. Received word that my transfer to No 2 Australian General Hospital had been arranged. Received transfer papers etc this evening. Will leave tomorrow.\n","54":"\nVery cold & misty morning. Got up early & got packed up. Left Becordel at 8.30 am by one of the Ambulance cars. Waited on Albert station from 8.30 am till 4.30 pm. Through being humbugged about regarding the train we had to go in, I had to change three times, then we had to travel in closed in trucks. Got movement order from Railway Transport Officer. We stopped at Amiens for ten minutes, & while I was away getting some food, the train started off, I had to go my hardest to catch it, I may say I wasn’t the only one either. After a lot of stopping & starting I eventually went to sleep, but as it was very cold I soon woke up & thinking it would be warmer with a blanket, went to the trouble of taking it off my pack, unrolling & rolling myself up in it, but I just got a bit comfortable when we arrived at Romescamp where we had to disentrain, it was about 11 pm then. Went to the canteen here (the most up to date canteen I have ever seen) & after having something to eat laid down on the floor & went fast asleep.\n","55":"\nWoke up about 7 am feeling very sleepy & tired. After I had a wash & some breakfast went for a brisk walk. There isn’t much of a town here. This is a very big railway junction (goods). After fooling about all the morning went down to the train that will take us as far as Abbeyville. Received twenty four hours rations. I found out that we have to go right back to Amiens & then to Abbeyville, & then the destination (Boulonge) & I wont be sorry when it is reached ether. There are a good few Takons (French colonists) employed here, they like the Chineses, & are extremely lazy, & dirty looking. Left here about 4.30 pm & arrived at Abbeyville at 8 pm. After having something to eat went to bed at the Y.M.C.A. hut. My word the Y.M.C.A. is doing splendid work as regards looking after the comforts of all British soldiers. They even had bunks, mattresses & pillows to sleep in. Had a much faster ride in the train than before, but it was very jerky.\n","56":"\nAfter having some breakfast we again entrained for Boulonge. Left Abbeyville at 10.30 am. There are a good few in our truck. There are only two of us Australians in the whole train load. Much better train journey, but my word it is cold travelling. So far we have only pulled up twice, & we have been making the pace \"some\", all the way. Arrived at Boulonge about 1.30 pm & after about half an hour fooling about with the military police, I eventually got out into the town. After having a look around I caught a tram to the Hospital at Wimmereaux. Arrived there at 5 pm & after having some tea reported at the orderly room. The Hospital is situated on a high hill overlooking the sea, & is 3½ miles out of Boulonge. It consists principally of \"shacks\" (huts) & occupies a very large area. Every convenience is attached here. My word it is a treat to get to a place like this after the field. \n","57":"\nReported at the orderly room at 9 am & went before the O.C. who seems rather a decent fellow, in fact all the Officers have a good name here. After asking me a few questions regarding my experience in nursing duties etc, I was put in B ward much against my wish. I absolutely tried my hardest to get on general duties. It is a pretty stiff job in the wards, I am in the Ward kitchen. My job consists of getting the meals, rations, coal, & cocoa for between the meals, dish out the meals, wash & clean up etc. We work from 7.15 am till 8 pm, the hours are too long for my liking. The electric light is laid on all through the camp.\n","58":"\nA most glorious day, sun shining with a slight \nwind\n breeze blowing. My word we have to work pretty hard, no time for a spell. There are only two orderlies & three sisters on a \"shack\". Had half a day off from 2 pm. Went down into \nBolou\n Boulonge for the afternoon. Had quite an enjoyable time. Took my old pay book round to the pay office, but have to wait three days for it now. As I wasn’t aware that the last tram left Boulogne for Wimmereaux at 7.30 pm I had to walk home. My word I was tired upon reaching the camp. We have 46 beds in our ward.\n","59":"\nAfter sending twenty walking cases over to England, we only had six left, so we had a very easy job. A very beautiful day. We have the worst sister in the camp for head sister over our ward. It was the other chaps afternoon off today. As things are very quite now, there will not be much to record in a diary.\n","60":"\nThere were three convoys in last night, but we only received six patients out of the three. Looks very much like rain this morning. Three \nof the\n chaps out of this unit left here this morning to go back to Australia on transport duties (lucky beggars). Getting more used to the job, also the women.\n","61":"\nSnowed pretty heavy during the night, but as it was fairly warm, & rained slightly during the day it was soon thawed. The weather was very cold all day. Went down into Boulonge during the afternoon with another chap out of the tent. Had rather an enjoyable time. As the pay office was shut I will now have to wait till Wednesday for my new pay book.\n","62":"\nWe only had twelve patients in all day. Most of the cases that come here are sent over to England as soon as they are fit to travel. We have forty six beds in our ward. Not feeling too good, my arm where I was enoculated for anti-tetanus is very itchy & aching.\n","63":"\nI seem to be getting \"some boy\" with the sisters here, they will do anything for me. I have nearly all my meals up in the ward now, a fellow can score some chicken & pudding there occasionaly. Still feeling pretty crook. Went of at 6 pm as it was my early afternoon off. \nShifted from the tent into a hut this evening, we have beds\n","64":"\nA very strong & exceptionally cold wind blowing all day; it would nearly cut you in to as soon as you would go outside. We had a bit of trouble with the tent during the early hours of this morning. It was nearly blown away on us. Went down into Boulonge again this afternoon, & upon inquiring for my pay book was informed that it had been forwarded onto here a couple of days previous. Shifted into the hut during this evening we have beds to sleep on there.\n","65":"\nSnowed fairly heavy last night, but as the sun came out in the morning it soon thawed. We have twenty three patients in today, the most we have had for about a week now. Ours is a surgical ward. Received my pay book from the orderly room this morning. All our beds were taken from us, three boards & two tressels were given to us to sleep on now.\n","66":"\nSnowing again today, but it isn’t so cold as previous. They seem a very decent mob we have in the hut. Took very bad \nabout\n in the afternoon & had to come back & go to bed at 7 pm. Very bilious with a bad headache, brought on by indigestion.\n","67":"\nVery cold wind blowing. The weather has been very changeable this last couple of days. We had five patients in today, & evacuated eleven to England so that left us with fourteen. They are all up bar two who are wounded in the legs. Most of them give a hand cleaning up around & in the ward. Still feeling off colour, but much better than last night. Dr. ordered some medicine for me.\n\nSaturday March 10th Con-\n\nwhich is very nasty to take. My afternoon off, but as I am feeling pretty crook, did not go out at all. On chicken diet today, also had two bottles of ale & two of stout given to me by the head sister, (the bottles are very small). Got eight letters this evening the latest was January 20th. The letter from home announced the arrival of the parcel I sent from Belgium.\n","68":"\nVery quiet all day. Very nice day all day. Still feeling pretty crook. Capture of Bagdad reported in the papers.\n","69":"\nSports in the way of football, hockey, boxing etc is regularly indulged in here. After evacuating nine patients to England we now only have five & as there isn’t much work to do, I took the afternoon off. Rained during last night, also drizzling rain nearly all today.\n","70":"\nVery misty all day. As it was my half day off, I went down to Boulogne in the evening, very quiet there though. (I did not have any money.\n","71":"\nOnly had seven patients all day. Feeling very sick all day. Still on chicken diet, pay day today, I had the option of drawing forty Francs (£1-8-8) , it is the first pay I have drawn till","72":"\n\nThursday March 15th\nThings are very quiet. Fellows in this unit seem very anxious to transfer to the field, some are even transferring to a fighting unit. Occassionaly you can hear the firing of guns here, mostly they come from the sea.\n","73":"\nThere are a good few permanent Base men employed here, fellows who have been wounded one, two, & three times, & are now unfit for further active service. My half day off. Went down to Boulogne with a cobber here, had quite an enjoyable time.\n\n","74":"\nRather a very nice day. The weather has been fairly clear this last few days, although this is supposed to be the month for very windy weather, & rain next month, something to look forward to aye! Was put on shack orderly this morning. There are two appointed each morning, & each sweeps half the hut. I swept my half & the other fellow forgot his, so both of us were to go up before the Colonel this evening, but he (the Colonel) was not in, so it was adjourned till 9 am tomorrow.\n","75":"\nThere are very good shower baths here, it is splendid to be able to get a bath as often as you like. Still keeping very windy & cold. Went up before a Captain re yesterdays business & of course all we got was a bit of a lecture. Scrubbed out the hut this morning, as everyone gave a hand, we soon had it finished.\n","76":"\nIt was exceptionally windy today. French women come for washing & I believe they do it very cheap too. Went into \nBoulogne\n Wimereaux this afternoon, things were very quiet. Played cards before I went out. Wimereaux is about a mile or so from here, in the opposite direction to Boulogne. The tram runs right into the town. It is a fairly large place & pretty lively.\n","77":"\nA very fine day. They are apparently going to put plants in, all through the camp, as every spare patch is dug up. I have received my mail as regular as could be expected lately. Not feeling too good today. Still living on soft food & chicken.\n","78":"\nVery cold all day, snowed slightly during the morning, but owing to the ground being so warm it soon melted. The water was turned on all through the camp this afternoon, my word it is going to save us a lot of trouble carrying it. Shrubs were planted in previously prepared places about the camp today.\n","79":"\nSnowing, hailing & raining today, at times the ground would be white, while half an hour afterwards it would be muddy. We are not receiving many patients in here now. We have only nine in the ward. The leave (to England) list was published today. I am the 48th on it, all going well I will have my leave within two months.\n","80":"\nVery cold last night. Snowed very heavy during the night, but as it was quite a warm day, the snow soon thawed. It was quite a nice day today, sun shining all day nearly. Very bad case of appendicitis operated on in our ward today. He pulled through all right so far.\n","81":"\nHanded pay book in today to be audited. They are audited every month. Was off for three hours this afternoon, & played cards all the time I was off. Very quiet. On an average \nwe h\n nine on leave every week, so I oughtn’t to be long, getting over on leave now.\n","82":"\nA very nice day. All clocks were put on an hour, midnight last night, as the daylight savings system comes in 24-25th March here, of course we were deprived of an hours sleep & my word it was noticeable too. My half day off today. Went for a walk down & about Boulogne, but came back pretty early.\n","83":"\nVery cold day. Very quiet. None of the wards have many patients in this last week.\n","84":"\nSnowed rather heavy this morning. Very cold wind blowing. There has been ten go on leave since the leave list has come out. Had from 1.30 pm till 4.30 pm off this afternoon. We only had 1 patient in today. Still on light diet.\n","85":"\nRather a very nice day. Payed forty francs (£1.8.8) this afternoon. I have £4.16.0 to credit still, & as leave is still going strong I intend to build on it. Havent had any mail lately, some word of an Australian mail being sunk. I think it is only a rumour though. Went to the moving pictures at Boulogne this evening, they were very good.\n","86":"\nRaining & hailing nearly all day. Very strong westerly wind blowing. We have had only eight patients in for about five days now, so we have a fairly easy time.\n","87":"\nVery nice day, although there is a bit of a westerly blowing. Was issued with a pair of boots this morning, but as they are a bit on the large size for me, I will have to wait until a smaller size is obtainable. Was off from 1.30 till 4.30 pm. We play draughts nearly all day.\n","88":"\nWas off half a day. Went down town, everything was very quiet. Trying to pick up a bit of the french language. I have made slight progress since I have been here. About 30 fellows from different units under the age of 19 have come in from the field. It appears they are putting all under the above age into base jobs, & capable fellows in the base jobs now, out into the field. About the best move done yet in my opinion.\n","89":"\nUsual fooling such as occurs on this date. very quiet. New chaps, allotted to different jobs.\n","90":"\nSnowed pretty heavy this afternoon. Went to the dentist to have four of my teeth attended to, but owing to pressure of work I have to go again tomorrow. All the fellows picked to go out into the field were medically examined, & are all very busy packing up. Four other men who have got transfers into the field are also busy & excited. Australian mail in today. I will have to wait for my letters to come from the 4th Field Ambulance. Got the afternoon off, & went down to Wimereaux, was back by seven.\n","91":"\nThere seems to be some mystification regarding the new draft of men going away. Nobody seems to know anything about them, even when they are to go. All have packed up in the meantime. Very windy & cold this morning. Myword it is cold getting up at 6 am. Dr Bush examined me this morning & referred me to Major Finn (eye, throat & ear specialist). I have tonsalitis. My left tonsal \nrequires\n is to be taken out.\n","92":"\nThere were a good few Australian wounded come in this morning. They have had a pretty bad turn in, according to what they say. Feeling very much off colour today. Major Finn examined me, & referred me to Captain McClure. Put in 2 ward this afternoon, & was booked up to undergo an operation for tonsalitis in England, quite unexpected but very acceptable. Got all my belongings etc together this evening. Said goodbye to the boys & sisters I had made the acquaintance of.\n","93":"\nUp pretty early as we left the hospital at 7 am. Rather a cold misty morning, but got warmer towards the middle of the day. Conveyed to the hospital ship in Boulonge Harbour by motor car. Went on the boat about 8 am & left Boulonge at 10 am. Had some dinner (stew & bread) on the boat coming over, & it was very acceptable too. Sea was very smooth. Escorted by a destroyer all the way.\n\nArrived at Dover about 11 am. French time is an hour earlier than the English. They haven’t got the daylight saving system in over here yet. We came over in the Hospital ship \"Princess Elizabeth\". Entrained (hospital train) at Dover for Norwich, a place in Norfolk. It took us about five hours in the train, never-the-less it was very comfortable travelling & tea given us coming along. We went right up to London from Dover & then came on here. I quite enjoyed the journey. Everybody along the line gave us a very good reception. Upon arrival at Norwich, motor cars were waiting to take us to the Norfolk War Hospital, about 3 miles distant. I came with another chap in a private car, it was a lovely spin out. \n\nThis is a very large hospital. I am in U Ward. There are only nurses employed here bar for the heavy work. Convalescent patients give a hand too. It is a treat to get between the sheets again. It was a lovely day as from the time we arrived in England, absolutely the warmest we have had so far this summer. Couldn’t sleep very well tonight although very tired, anyhow I was glad to get to bed. There were no stretcher cases on our train. All walking.\n","94":"\nSnowing rather heavy today. Not feeling too well today. We have to wash at 5 am, breakfast 6 am, morning lunch 9 am, Dinner 12 noon. Afternoon tea 3 pm, tea 5 pm & a cup of cocoa at 8 pm. I am on light diet owing to my throat being sore. wrote four letters, we have to pay the penny postage here, just as well they will take French money, it is all I have. There is a Belgian civillian Dr in attendance here, he recorded me tonsalitis & shell shock, according to the symptions given him. He seems a very nice chap. A very fine afternoon. Had a bad time tonight.\n","95":"\nI have a throat gargle & medicine to make me sleep of a night time. We have a decent meal served out at dinner time, otherwise we only have bread & butter, & an egg or bacon for breakfast. Feeling much better today. The days seem awful long lying in bed. All clocks etc were put on an hour at midnight, daylight saving system.\n","96":"\nThe weather is getting grand now, every day is getting warmer. Everything is very quiet. A Major examined me today & marked me to a special hospital, I don’t know what it means though. No feeling too good today.\n","97":"\nThe weather changes very quick here, it was snowing this morning, at dinner time the sun was shining, & now it is again cloudy. Feeling pretty crook in the region of the abdomons. There seems to be a good lot of chaps in here, most of them are Tommies & are marked up for convalescent camp.\n","98":"\nFeeling very bad last night & this morning. Snowing this morning, but changed to a very fine afternoon. Got all my French money changed into English here, a franc is worth eight pence, or 10 francs for 7\/-. Very quiet lying in bed.\n","99":"\nVery dull day, snowing slightly, also very cold. Was shifted right down one end of the ward, I was just about in the middle before. There are about 60 beds altogether in the ward, laid out in four rows. We have a piano & gramophone, so we are never short of music.\n","100":"\nSnowed fairly heavy today. Very bleak & cold. Feeling much better. Booked up to go to an Australian hospital & wont be sorry when we do go either, as we are missing the benefits of our red cross, certainly we got a few things issued out to us here by the red cross, but not near so much as if we were in our own hospital.\n","101":"\nA sunshiney day, although rather cold. From what I can see here an Australian or even a Colonial \nmen\n are treated as dirt. They get only the attention that is absolutely necessary, & not even that from some of the nurses, who have heads on them like blocks of wood, & are very pig-headed.\n","102":"\nVery quiet. Very startling news in the papers regarding the push at Arras. Was up this afternoon for half an hour for the first time. Felt very weak. Do a lot of reading to pass time away. Rather a dull day.\n","103":"\nThere has been about five fellows got their discharge from the army, in this ward since I have been here, they went out in civilian clothes, lucky beggars. There has also been a good few discharged to convalescent camp too. Rather a fine day. Some of the fellows have visitors & relations come to see them, they are allowed in every Wednesday, Saturday & Sunday from 2 till 4 pm.\n","104":"\nVery quiet. Another convoy arrived during the night. Left arm paining very much, lost use of it from the shoulder to the elbow; under galvanin treatment for same. I have to go down every morning at 9 am. I have to put my arms in two bowls of electrified water for about a quarter of an hour, & then have them massaged.\n","105":"\nWe received 22 patients out of the convoy. It arrived here about 3 am this morning. Snowed rather heavy today. I am well enough to walk about now. Was put on \"duty\" in the bathroom this morning, I only have to clean out two baths in the morning. On account of no orderlies here as soon as you are out of bed, you have to work.\n","106":"\nEvery day longer I am here, I hate the place more, there seems no hope of our being sent to our own hospital, & the treatment is cruel, it makes a fellow wish to goodness he was well up in the front line trench, although I hope never to go back there again. Very dull weather, still snowing. Feeling much better today, although I had rather a bad night.\n","107":"\nThere is a lady who comes round every Wednesday & pays the Australians; we are allowed to draw 3\/6 a week. I have had no need to draw any so far I still have about 14\/-, She is an Australian. Very fine day, sun shining nearly all day.\n","108":"\nA lovely day. Dr marked me as a walking out patient. The weather is that enticing that I would love to go for a real long walk, but I am not strong enough on my legs yet. A convoy arrived this morning, we received about eleven patients which just filled our ward up, there were a couple of stretcher cases. Went to the pictures (cinema) this afternoon. They are shown every week for the benefit of the patients. Had quite an enjoyable time. It is about a quarter of an hour walk from here. I felt a bit tired when I got back. The fellows here are up to all sorts of jokes of a night time, there are some real hard cases among them. I don’t suppose there are two out of the same unit here.\n","109":"\nVery quiet. Fine day. The food problem in England is getting very bad, pretty near in every line. We have been cut down the half slice of bread for dinner, that is the only way it has affected us.\n","110":"\nA lovely day. Put in for a \"walking out pass\" with another fellow here this morning. Got pass from 1 pm till 7.30 pm. We decided to go to Norwich, which is about 3 miles away. We walked about a mile, then we hired a rowing boat (cost us 2\/- for the afternoon), rowed right into Norwich via river, tied our boat up & had a good time in the town, it is a pretty big place. My word there are a terrible lot of girls there, & with the hospital suit on & blue band on your arm, \nyou\n we got a good reception where ever we went. We rowed back via river, & got back to Hospital about 6.30 pm very tired, but both declaring we had had a very good afternoon.\n","111":"\nA fine day, as we are to go away to the Australian hospital tomorrow, we had to draw our kit this evening, & after a lot of waiting & humbugging about we eventually got it. One of the nurses pressed my tunic for me. Feeling very crook this evening. Of course the usual row & tricks went on tonight, as when there is anyone going away..\n","112":"\nLeft the hospital at 7 am. Motor cars conveyed us to the railway station from the main building. We had to change at Norwich. Had quite an enjoyable journey to Liverpool St station (London). Motor cars conveyed us to Paddington Railway station, caught train & came on to Southall. Had to walk from the station to the Hospital. About half a mile. Southall is about 10 miles from London. The patients here are all Australians. There are a terrible lot with legs, or arms off & eyes out, they are waiting for transport back to Australia. General leave is granted to within a three mile radius of the hospital from 2 pm till 6 pm. The Hospital is a very large place which used to be an asylum once. There are a good few munition girls about here, & my word they are rough too. A fine day.\n","113":"\nThey get good food here. The patients have to tidy up, make their own beds etc here, but it helps to pass away the time. A lovely afternoon. Went to a place called Ealing (about three miles away) this afternoon, & went to the moving pictures there. There is an Electric tram service here.\n","114":"\nDrew my uniform out of the pack store this morning, but owing to our orders to proceed to Weymouth being cancelled, we had to hand it back. The weather is getting much warmer now, today was beautiful all day, went to Ealing for the afternoon. Everything very quiet.\n","115":"\nA lovely day. Caught Electric tram to Ealing, & underground train to Charing Cross London. My intentions, are to visit the Robinsons at 52 Lefevre Rd Bow. After asking numerous policemen, who gave me a different direction each time, & riding about the East end of London \nfor about\n in buses & trams for about 2 hrs, I eventually arrived at the above address. Found the people to be very nice. They were waiting for me & gave me a very cordial welcome. Spent a very enjoyable afternoon. Went for a walk through Blackwall Tunnel, I can now say I have been both under & over the Thames River. Arrived home about half an hour late, very tired.\n","116":"\nWe always give a hand in the ward of a morning, & by doing so are always sure of a \nwalking out\n late pass (until 9 pm). Went to Ealing by tram this afternoon, but as it was very quiet there another chap & I decided to go to London on the top of a motor bus, had quite a good time.\n","117":"\nA real Glorious day. The weather appears to be getting very much warmer. Went to London this evening, we went to Marble Arch, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Queen Victoria statue. Green Park, the Strand, Trafalgar Square, Pickadilly circus, & back home by the same route as we came out by. It was lovely on top of the Bus in the fresh air.\n","118":"\nThere is plenty of recreation here, there are two lovely billiard tables, & plenty of reading, including Australian literature & books. The trees are all beginning to bud, & it is marvellous how quickly they grow too. Put in for a late pass but got a knock back.\n","119":"\nEnglish people seems to get very excited over the first call of the cuckoo, which they say is the sign of spring. A lovely day. Very quiet.\n","120":"\nWent for a very nice walk. Was watching the means of getting barges through the canals & locks, it was very interesting. As we are to go to Weymouth tomorrow we have to draw kit at 6 pm this afternoon.\n","121":"\nFell in at 8.30 am & caught a train to Paddington station London, where we caught an express train for Weymouth; & my word it did travel too, at times I reckon we done 60 miles an hour easy. It was a beautiful trip & everywhere along the line was lovely & green. Upon arrival here, we were conveyed to Monte Video Camp by motors. We are in shacks here. It is a very big camp. This is the last camp for those embarking for Australia.\n","122":"\nA lovely day. Reveille goes at 6.30 am & we have to be out & everything straight by 7 am. Went through medical board & classed as B.1.B.A.C, that is under observation with physical drill, also went through, dental scan, & kit inspection. Put into different hut this afternoon, according to our classification.\n","123":"\nStarted on the physical drill today, & my word it hurt too, as I haven’t done any drill for about 10 months. Re-examined by the Colonel today & classed as B1 A2, that is I am getting better. Today is a real summers day. The Camp is \nright up\n on top of a big hill overlooking the sea, & about 3 miles out of Weymouth.\n","124":"\nVery cold wind blowing. It was a very cold night last night. It is very poor food here, a fellow feels hungry the whole day, & what we do get isnt cooked right. The food is spoilt by the cooks. Went for a walk to the harbour this afternoon.\n","125":"\nA lovely day. \nWas\n Received second issue of clothing today, issued with a good few articles not needed, apparently the military is not short of clothing. Fell in 2.30 pm & was marched to Westham, a distance of about 2 miles. It is nearly in Weymouth. The huts are much smaller at Westham. Had our kit bags carried. Very tired upon arrival here.\n","126":"\nRe-examined & classified today. I am now marked B1 A3 (getting closer to France once more. The heads are very strict in this camp. Leave is granted at the rate of 20% till 9 pm & 10% till 11pm. Shifted into No 9 hut this evening: was enoculated this afternoon & my word it is playing up with me, my arm is very stiff & sore.\n","127":"\nA very cold day. Feeling very sick, I can hardly move my arm today it is very sore. Went to sick parade & was marked light duties. We get rather good food here, one thing it is well cooked. This is a very big camp & there are a thousand men here. Put in for my furlough due, this morning. Went to a Lantern lecture this evening at the Y.M.C.A. Subject, Description & principal places of interest of London, & views of Australia, it was very interesting. Owing to time only half could be shown, the rest will be shown tomorrow.\n","128":"\nRained this morning, but a lovely afternoon. Medically examined to see if I am fit to go on furlough tomorrow, & of course the usual kit inspection was held. A lot of unnecessary bother. Payed eight pounds ten shillings this afternoon, I don’t know how long that is going to last, at the prices everything is now. A pound is worth about twelve shillings here now. Saw the rest of the lantern slides at the Y.M.C.A. tonight. They were very good. Some very pretty scenes from around the Blue Mountains were show. It was quite a treat to see such scenes of the country most dear to us.\n\nThursday\n","129":"\nWas up very early as we had to get ready & have breakfast by 7.15 am. After being inspected & fooled about waiting for our passes etc, we caught the 9.5 am train for London. It was a lovely journey. We went right along the South west coast of England, & the scenery was beautiful at places. We arrived at Waterloo station about 1.30 pm & marched through the city of Westminster to Horseferry Road, Victoria, where we received a ration allowance of £1.4.6 for the fourteen day. Had a very good meal at the war Chest fund’s club, for which we paid a shilling. Went per underground train \nto\n from St James Park station to Bow Rd station, & walked out to Mr Robinsons place at Lifevre Rd Bow. They are very homely people, & made me most welcome. Their unmarried daughter is staying home with them.\n","130":"\nWent down to the meat markets at Smithfield with Uncle. (I call Mr & Mrs Robinson uncle & aunt) this morning. There wasn’t very much there, & what there was, it was very dear. I was very tired when we arrived home. We had to walk the biggest part as all of the busses were too full. Went to Miss Farmers place at Ilford this afternoon. Miss Farmer is a very great friend of Tal’s (Miss Robinson) Spent a very pleasant afternoon. It was a lovely day. Had a very rough ride home on the tram, it was very jolty. looks like rain this evening.\n","131":"\nWent with Uncle & Tal to the Baptist church here, I did not think much of the sermon as the parson just spoke of the ways & doings of the missionary in Congo, it wasn’t at all interesting. Went for a walk to Victoria Gardens with Tal, I quite enjoyed it very much. Didn’t go out tonight, we had a visitor, & sang some hymns.\n","132":"\nVery smoky & Hazy \nday\n this morning but gradually got clear about noon. A lovely evening. Mr & Mrs & Tal Robinson & I went to the Natural Museum at South Kensington this afternoon. A most enjoyable time was spent. The museum is a fine large building of some wonderful artistic work adorning it. The most particular place of note was closed today, that was the whale house, I regret very much not seeing it. The next place of interest was birds & their habits in their natural state. We later visited where very old structures, cupboards, chariots, carvings etc were exhibited. I was very tired upon arrival home. Went round to the London Fire Brigade, where we saw Mr & Mrs G. Swaine. (nee Miss Robinson).\n","133":"\nStopped a home all day. Very muggy day. Went to Coleseum Theatre in the night, It was variety, & every turn was very good, we (Tal & I) both had quite an enjoyable time. It was about midnight when we arrived home. There is a \"Bus\" strike on here. The streets seems to be very quite without them, one thing a fellow hasn’t to much trouble & dodging getting across the heavily trafficked streets. Strike caused through grievence with Government.\n","134":"\nLooks very much like rain. Went for a walk round Bow this morning with Mr R. He also visited some people he knew. As there is no bath here I had to go to the Council Baths to have a bath, they are very good. Met Tal at Homerton station & we went to Madam Tussards at \nSouth\n Baker St. It is a fine display of wax-work figures etc. There are some very interesting personalities there, also some ghastly scenes. Some of the figures are very amusing, & life like. Developed some photos we took yesterday, also a real I took in France, they all came out fairly good, Tal has a plate camera.\n","135":"\nRaining all day, I printed two of the photos we developed last night, but the light was not strong enough. As I am going to Edinburgh this evening, I left home at 11.30 am & went to Queen Victoria’s statue, where I was to meet another chap, who was going up with me, but he did not turn up, so I decided to go without him, & went on to Kings Cross station. Caught 7.15 pm train for Edinburgh. Slept every now & again. There were seven in the carriage. The train seemed more like a troop train than an express, as there were a terrible lot of soldiers travelling by it.\n","136":"\nArrived in Edinburgh at 4.45 am. Had some breakfast at the red cross room on the station. Went for a walk round the city. It is a very well laid out place with very wide streets, but the trams are the doers. They are cable trams & very small. Raining this morning. Went out in a motor bus to the Fort Bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth. It is a marvellous piece of engineering work, & is a mile & three quarters long, two spans is 1,710 feet high, & the highest part is 361 ft above high water. It cost over £3,000,000 & took 5,000 men 7 years to construct. \n\nAfter we had dinner we (a N.Zr. & myself) went up to the old Edinburgh castle, parts of which date back to 1349, & is a very historic place, commanding a great view all over the city. We later went through the Edinburgh Academy, where there are some splendid paintings, some worth hundreds of pounds. I put up at the Victoria League club for the night, it is a very comfortable place established only for overseas troops. My feet were aching very much when I arrived at the club. I like the ways of & the scotch people very much. Things are much cheaper here than in London. Went for a walk through the gardens.\n","137":"\nDid not get out until about 9.30 am. Caught the 1 pm train for Glasgow, arriving there about 2.15 pm. There was a \"Scotch mist\" at Edinburgh when we left, but it is bright enough upon arrival at Glasgow. Booked bed at Y.M.C.A., they only charge sixpence there & not bad beds either.\n\nover\n\nSaturday May 19th Cont-\n\nGlasgow is very much bigger than Edinburgh, & I like the place very much. Electric trams are the principal means of conveyance, & they are very cheap too, you can go a long way for halfpenny. There are some very fine buildings here, & the streets are nice & wide. One thing as struck me as being peculiar & that was, how the people have to line up in the streets to gain admittance into a picture show or a theatre, another was a threepenny & sixpenny shop, a place where everything is purchased at 3d. or 6d. or a quantity at the same price. Things are very cheap.\n\nEverybody seems very obliging & sociable. I had a good look round Glasgow this afternoon on trams, at times walking. I also visited a wax works place which was not very interesting, especially to anyone with not too much money. It rained during the afternoon, & continued throughout the night. The Y.M.C.A. people are very good & obliging, money, valuable, & packs are taken care of without any extra charge. Some of the scotch people talk very broad here, at times I can hardly understand them. There are a good few Australians up here on leave.\n","138":"\nRaining this morning, but a fine afternoon my feet were very sore, therefore I did not go out very far. It was ten am when I got up & by the time I had breakfast it was dinner time, so I put the two together. Went to a sing song & lecture at the Y.M.C.A. this afternoon. They have a fine theatre here, it was quite a pleasure to sit in such comfortable chairs, & the lecture was rather interesting, but the singing was very poor. Caught 10 pm train from Central Railway station for London. I forgot to say I came up by the Eastern Railway & am going back by the Great Western, so I am doing the round journey.\n","139":"\nArrived at Euston about 9 am being about 1 hr 40 min late. I slept fairly well coming down in the train, there were only four of us in the carriage. Went by tube to Charing Cross & thence to Bow Rd per District Railway. Everybody is talking, about having a great thunder storm here last night, I believe the lightning, thunder & rain was dreadful. Never went anywhere all day, but went for a walk through Victoria Park this evening. \n","140":"\nWent for a walk with uncle to Middlesex St (otherwise known as Petticoat Lane). It is a very dirty place, & of course everybody there are on the make. (\"think of the proff. & hand movement lot). Went to Homerton \"per North London Railway\" this afternoon & walked home through the park with Tal. Mr & Mrs Will Robinson came round this evening, & we had quite a nice game of whist. All the search lights were on about midnight, it was rumoured that an attack by hostile aircraft was threatened, but apparently they never reached this far.\n","141":"\nIt was a lovely day. I didn’t go out this morning, only fooled about the place. Met Tal at Homerton & we then went to Charing Cross, where we went & had tea with Miss Farmer & another Girl friend of hers. Tal & I then went for a walk through St James Park, Green Park, & Hyde Park, all of these Parks are very close together. We caught a Motor bus for Old Ford from Marble Arch. It was a lovely ride out & we had the benefit of a nice cool breeze blowing, by riding on top of the bus. It is generally the custom of the English to have supper every night.\n","142":"\nEmpire day. Great display of flags along every street. Went to the Hippodrome Theatre with Tal tonight, it wasn’t bad, but was rather uncomfortable. They had some very good turns on, including George Robey, & some tip top dancers. Air raid by 3 Zeppelins on Norfolk district early this morning.\n","143":"\nA lovely day. Caught 10.15 am express from Paddington to Weymouth. It was very hard leaving London, & seemed rotten when I arrived back at camp at No 2 Command Depot, Westham. Had a very nice journey down; some people who were on their way down here for their summer holidays, & in the same carriage as myself, were very kind & obliging to me, the old chap sported a cup of tea, biscuits & sandwiches for dinner. Very quiet in Camp.\n","144":"\nCamp is very quiet, of course the usual lots come & go. I was put in No 2 hut, I don’t know any of the fellows there. Went for a walk into Weymouth & around the Promenade round the beach. Weymouth is rather a large \ntown\n quite pretty & old town. I feel very down hearted after coming back from furlough.\n","145":"\nRained rather heavy during this morning. Very muddy on the parade ground. Went to Church service in the Y.M.C.A. this morning. Doing Mess orderly today, two are appointed every day, also a hut orderly.\n","146":"\nRained nearly all day, it looks as if it has set in. Reclassified this morning but I don’t know what I was marked, the Dr didn’t examine me much, they don’t seem to care much for your welfare. Owing to the rain, we had no drill this morning. Our hut is detailed as fire picket tonight, we cannot leave the hut, & it is very monotonous.\n","147":"\nRained again today but not enough to hinder us from drilling. Settling down to camp life again. We do a hour physical drill in the morning & after dinner, & go for a route march to the esplanade at Weymouth immediately after; as soon as we get down there we are dismissed & can go where we please for half an hour or longer, according to the time we have to be back by. There were great crowds on the beach today, there seem to be a lot of holiday makers about. Had my photo taken this evening, I have to wait until a week before I can get them though.\n","148":"\nToday is a lovely day after the rain, there is just a gentle refreshing breeze blowing, it makes everyone happy & jovial. Everywhere is nice & green & the trees are largely enriched with fresh grand blossoms & rich green leaves. There are parties detailed off every morning to dig the soil between the huts, sow potatoes & other vegetables. The food is rather good here, but there could be more.\n","149":"\nWas paid 10\/- today. I had 14\/8 in my pay book, but they apparently don’t pay the odd money. 3d was also deducted, for hut damages. This is done every month to pay all damages caused to huts by unknown persons. Went for a walk through Weymouth this evening. It was lovely walking round the esplanade. There aren’t so many people about, now as this last few days, of course the holidays are now over.\n","150":"\nVery cold day with strong wind blowing, put in a cold night last night. I forgot to say that yesterday we were put under isolation, owing to vermin being found by about half a dozen fellows, in there blankets, & clothes. All our blankets & mattresses were taken off us, & late last night we received three blankets which were very thin, & it was extra cold during the night, so we all had a very cold time of it. Put on digging this morning, I prefer it much better to physical training. Went for a walk to Weymouth, but did not stop long. Sent pcl to Mrs R.\n","151":"\nHad another freezer last night, still without our mattresses, but we will have them tonight for certain. Not feeling well today. Very quiet, did not go out of camp at all. Very interested in a book, so my mind was partially occupied. Feeling very much down in the dumps. I have lost 8 lbs since coming back from furlough, camp life cannot be agreeing with me.\n","152":"\nA lovely day. There is a big draught of men going to Perham Camp tomorrow, I think so far I am among them. I am not too anxious to be going. On mess orderly all day. Did not go out all day, as I had to be medically examined, I could not go on church parade.\n","153":"\nTwo drafts went away this morning, one at 7 am for Herdcot & the other at 10 am for Perham Downs, I was lucky enough to get out of both. It was very funny, on both occasions each lot hooted & counted out the adjutant, (Lieutenant Donald Grant) He brought \neach\n the first lot back twice & the last lot once. He is an absolute rotter of the first waters, & deserves all he got. I have heard since there is to be trouble about it. Got a late pass & went to an entertainment in the Jubilee Hall in Weymouth, it wasn’t too bad.\n","154":"\nWe are having lovely weather this last few days. Digging ground for potatoes this morning. Went for a route march to the beach & whilst there had a dip in the sea, it was O.K too, only you had to walk a long way out before you got to any depth of water at all. There are no breakers, therefore only swimming, no surfing. Went for a row in a boat with another fellow this eveing, I proved an utter failure at rowing, & nearly upset the boat a couple of times. Sent parcel home to Australia.\n","155":"\nVery quiet all day. Rained fairly heavy last night, but turned out fine today. Doing both physical drill & route march before & after dinner. (Went to a free entertainment at the Pavilion Hall, It was both very good & comical, went for a walk round \nWeymouth\n Portland harbour, it is very pretty round there.) x. \n","156":"\nx Should read today, nothing startling in camp. I don’t notice the Adjutant knocking about so much since he was counted out. I heard he is to go back to Australia, then it is only those sort of sooners who can get back so easy.\n","157":"\n\nRather a dull bleak day. Marked from B1 A3 to A3 & transferred to B Group, No 56 hut, I suppose it means I will be back in France very soon now. Put on draft to go to Perham Downs tomorrow morning, in my opinion they are a bit sudden. Went out canoeing in Weymouth harbour, the water was very calm & we had a grand time. Another fellow & myself went out in a double canoe.\n","158":"\nA lovely day. Owing to being on draft had to get up at 5.30, & have breakfast at 6 am, but when I went to fall in, the sergeant informed me that I had been cut off, of course I did not mind\n","159":"\nThe weather is great now, getting warmer every day. Went for a very nice walk round the promenade & right over the cliffs. Very tired when I arrived back home.\n","160":"\nPut on draft to go to Perham Downs tomorrow morning, of course we went through the usual medical inspections, also kit inspections. Went for a very nice paddle in a canoe, I was out for two hours, & went all over the harbour. The water was very calm.\n","161":"\nWas up at 5.30 am, & had an early breakfast. Left Westham Camp about 7.30 & entrained at Weymouth, (left about 9 am). After changing at Poole, Andover & Salisbury we eventually arrived at Tidworth. Marched from Tidworth to Perham Downs Camp. Put in No 5 Camp Details. I do not go much on the camp here, it is in a very outstandish place, & seems very dead. We are camped in tents here, & with only three blankets, it is very hard sleeping on the boards. It is very dusty, it will be very hard to keep anything clean. There \nare\n is a great assortment of different units here. Viz:- Infantry, A.M.C. Artillery, Engineers, Flying Corps, wireless operators, Light Horse, cyclists, pioneers, etc, well in fact I think every branch of the army is represented.\n","162":"\nThe weather is getting much warmer now, a perspiration can be easily raised. There \nare\n is plenty of physical \ndrill\n drill & drill here. There must be fully a brigade of men here altogether. On Infantry drill nearly all day, it is the first drill of the kind I have done for about eighteen months, so I proved very awkward anyhow there were plenty more besides me \"in the same boat\". Some of the fellows are sent over to France from this camp. I am expecting to go to Parkhouse Camp on Monday. The food isn’t bad here, but not enough.\n","163":"\nIt is very dusty camping in the tents, everything get very dirty in no time, & you feel just as dirty five minutes after you have a wash. There are plenty of officers here. By going on the medical inspection this morning I missed a whole day route march, & this \nevening\n afternoon we went out & laid down all the time so we have had a very easy day. The O.C. here is an artist, he is a bit off his head (general opinion), but very good to the men, he comes out with some very comical sayings. \n\nThere was a big draft left for France this morning. The light horse is expecting to leave for Egypt any day now. I wish I was going with them. Every one in camp seems to be broke, it is a common occurrence, now one very seldom has any money a couple of days after pay day, especially now as the prices of everything is very dear, & the two principal items (cigarettes & beer) have gone up tremendously.\n","164":"\nI am in the \"Soft\" squad here, we knock off work half an hour before the \"hard\" lot, both in the morning & afternoon. We get very decent food now, They shifted us to another cook house & the O.C. personally inspected the food we were getting, therefore the above result. Paid this morning 30\/-, being about 3\/- overpaid. The weather is getting very warm now, I have discarded all my winter clothing.\n","165":"\nWe haven’t done much drill today, Went to an asphysciating gas parade, we were to go through the gas, but owing to so many, & us being the last, we hadn’t time. Met Jack West accidently in the canteen. Talking over old times etc. \n","166":"\nWent on church parade, all the protestants went to the church of England. Very quiet in camp. There was no reveille this morning, so we had a good sleep in.\n","167":"\nRaining nearly all day. Fell in 8 am & after a lot of unnecessary bothering about, we marched to Parkhouse Camp, a distance of about 5 miles. Things haven’t altered much since I was here last year, most of the old staff is still here. Put in No 6 hut. There are a lot of fellows here who haven’t seen field service yet, They seem anxious to get over to France, & get as many tips as they can. Raining to heavy to drill this evening. Had our records taken also particulars of previous service.\n","168":"\nThis camp will do me, they have a fairly decent lot of Officers & N.C.O’s here now. Went up for reclassification this morning & was marked B1 A, so that means I will be here for a while yet, of course I had to put in a few \"good ones\" to get as low as that. We get very good food here. The chaps who have been here for a while says there was a riot over the food about three weeks ago, & from that day things have altered considerably. Went for a bit of a route march & lecture this afternoon. They do not so much drill here, & then it is all stretcher drill.\n\nI have met a good few fellows I know, including some who were here this time last year. Some of the \"staff\" are still here, perhaps they may find out some day there is actually a war on. Went to a concert in the Church of England this evening. It was a London troupe & not up to much, of course some of the items were good & \nsome\n very crook, nerve racking to Listen to.\n","169":"\nA big draft picked to go to France today, there are only about 30 \"neutrals\" left now. We have to take our blankets out \nevery\n on early morning parade every morning to air them, & a very good idea too! Had a tooth filled this afternoon & it aching \"\nsome\n\" now, of course it was filled in military style. Very windy all day. Rained this evening. We have a very good & sociable mob in our hut.\n","170":"\nRaining nearly all day. The draft which was picked yesterday, is in full working order, equipped, & ready to leave for France any time. Owing to a misunderstanding a few of us did not fall in when the bugle blew at 3 pm. Result, all put on gardening fatigue. It rained just after & we had to knock off, everyone that did fall in had to stop out in the rain, until the roll was called etc, so we had the best end of the stick after all. Put on guard at the orderly room 5 pm this evening.\n","171":"\nDone guard till 5 am \nthis morning\n & 9 – 11 this morning & 3 – 5 this afternoon. Received fourteen letters from Australia this afternoon, including 3 from home & four from my sister. Very quiet on guard. There is a concert on tonight, but I have too many letters to answer to go. Did not write letters. Went to concert: Very good.\n","172":"\nPut on Quartermasters fatigue, very easy job, only worked about twenty minutes. It is a bit cold today. Down at the Y.M.C.A. playing billiards, bobs, & bagatelle all the afternoon, had a very decent time. Draft finally examined, & paid this afternoon they are leaving tomorrow morning at 7 am. I will be sorry when they go, as every one that is out of this hut is very decent fellows, they are absolutely the best I have met.\n","173":"\nDraft left at 7 am this morning, I felt like falling in & going with them, but it only lasted a little while. Just at the time the roll was called. Put on cleaning up the mess the draft left, I had to help clean up No 5 hut. There are only about forty left in camp now. Shifted from No 6 hut to No 17. Owing to nobody being left after all the fatigues being detailed, there was no church parade for us. Very monotonous this afternoon. Bridge is a favourite game in camp here.\n","174":"\nCamp is very quiet. Had a tooth filled & another pulled this afternoon. I felt no pain while the dentist was pulling it, but from half an hour afterwards it was very sore. Very monotonous in the evening. Word came through that all mail to Egypt & Australia between the date of 13 to 23rd May has been sunk. I do not think I \nhad\n sent any mail about that time.\n","175":"\nA lovely day. Put on Quartermasters fatigue this morning, it only lasted half an hour, & is considered the best job in the camp. Had nothing to do at all this afternoon, so we have had a very easy day of it. The food we get here is absolutely splendid & well cooked.\n","176":"\nPut on work in Quartermasters store, it seems to be a permanent job, I hope so anyhow, & it is on a whole an easy job. Was picked for guard, but on account of being on the above job, was pulled off at the last moment. I haven’t to go on any parades now, thank goodness. Went to concert in Church of England hut. Saw some very good airial Feat this evening.\n","177":"\nI forgot to say that last night, an Australian aviator came over the camp & done some amazing, daring & splendid feats, he was absolutely the best I have ever seen. He flew up side down for about a quarter of an hour, done the cork screw dive, (that is, his aeroplane swinging round coming down) volplaning, very quick turning, & the tail dive (that is to fly up perpendicular & descent tail first) & various other feats. Rained this evening. Was paid a pound today, about 7 shillings overpaid.\n","178":"\nThis last couple of days there has been a great number of lads under 19 come into this camp. They are being put on permanent Base jobs about here until they become the age of nineteen. They are a very rough lot too. Rained very heavy during last night & this morning. There has been no drill all day owing to the rain.\n","179":"\nOwing to shortage of cash, I have to do my own washing. Washing is done very cheap, but I want all my spare money, as I am putting in for leave soon. Camp is very quiet. Draft expecting to leave tomorrow for France. Very busy at store this morning.\n","180":"\nWe have to work nearly all day Sunday, but there isn’t very much to do. Cleaning up mess the previous fellows left, & my word there is a bit of it too. Draft left 9 pm tonight. We are having grand weather now.\n","181":"\nI haven’t done any photography yet. I haven’t any films or other necessaries.\n\nI don’t think I will get any, as we do not get very much time out of the store. Camp is very quite after draft going out.\n","182":"\nHad a good deal of work today. Every Tuesday is the day when all second hand clothing is to be changed, so what with changing the clothes & having our other work to do we were kept busy all day. These lads under 19 are very deamons, they will stop at nothing, what are not in hospital through fights with plates, mugs etc, are either in \"clink\" or defaulters, there are very few good ones amongst them. Very dull looking this evening.\n","183":"\nRaining nearly all day. It is very muddy round the camp. Had a very busy time in the store stock taking, & giving the whole place a \"spring cleaning\". Received a pck from Australia, which was sent over a year ago, & was addressed to Egypt. It only contained a pr of socks, but they are very acceptable, as nearly all my others have shrunk away that much that I have a struggle to put them on. Feeling crook tonight.\n","184":"\nVery sick today. Had hardly any sleep last night. I have terrific pains in my sides, back, & chest. Went on sick parade & the Dr ordered me to hospital, but later it was found that the hospital was full, so I had to go back to bed in the hut. Spent a very miserable day. Received another late parcel from Mrs Nelson, it contained two cakes of soap, three handkerchiefs & a tin of ginger.\n","185":"\nRained slightly this morning, but came out clear this afternoon. We do not see near so many airoplanes here now as we used to last year. It is a daily occurrence to see them over the camp though.\n\nEverything is fresh & the grass nice & green after the rain. There are a good few wild flowers out too.\n","186":"\nJob very quiet in store. The lads under 19 pest us now & again for changes, there is pracitally nothing in the store, so we have the same old storey to tell them \"nothing doing\". There was a draft of men go to Lark Hill this morning, so every A.M.C man in camp now is put on fatigues.\n","187":"\nToo busy to go to church parade this morning, so I went down to a service in the Y.M.C.A. this afternoon. We very seldom have to work on a Sunday afternoon, unless there is a draft going out or coming in.\n","188":"\nPut in for leave to go to London, this morning. Was recommended by the Quarter Master. I put in for 48 hrs from 11 to 13th July. Not feeling too well today. Was classified this morning & marked B2A. (6 months in England) & recommended for a board to see if I am permantly unfit for further field service. One thing I do not want to go back to France. Weighed myself today, have lost seven pounds since coming from Perham Downs camp.\n","189":"\nWord came back that my leave was turned down, so all my made up plans are now squashed. I never said a word either when they put my name up on the \"not approved\" list, & still believe the proper person never saw it, never mind I will put in again later. Three of us here go down to the Salvation Army or Y.M.C.A hut every evening now & have supper, we are coming out some, I can tell you. I have met a good few fellows I knew in France, over here, most of them have been wounded.\n","190":"\nToday was the first day I have gone for a walk out of camp, it was only then a chap wanted to purchase some goods down at Shipton village, & he persuaded me to go for a walk with him. Everyone who receives over 14 days detention here is sent to Wandsworth, on the Isle of Wight to complete his term.\n","191":"\nPad day, I did not draw any for myself, but drew £2 for a pal who is on leave. We are having lovely weather here now. The Russians on the Eastern Front have appeared to wake up, they have started \"pushing\".\n","192":"\nPlenty of work today. There were a good few drunk here last night, of course it is a usual thing pay day, another thing, all the go round raffling different things on that day.\n","193":"\nThe chap who has been working with me, was taken off today, so I have double work to do now, that is outside, but another fellow was put on the clerical job, so I have only outside work to do now, there isn’t very much to do, & if there happens to be any heavy work a fatigue party is always drawn of the parade. Received fourteen letters from Australia.\n","194":"\nVery peculiar day, Sunshine & raining, a couple of very heavy showers too, it seems to have cleared away this evening though. Answering letters nearly all day, all fairly long ones too. All the lads here made a riot this evening about 8 p.m. & it last well into midnight. None of the old hands were in it. The trouble was caused through gambling. Two of them had a fight & the Military Police interferred, one lad was taken to the \"clink\", & the mob would not let the other be taken, so the M.P. & Warrant Officer tried force, result Corporal M.P. broken jaw in two places. W.O. skin knocked off his face & black eye.\n\nSunday July 15th Con\n\ntwo of the lads knocked out with bricks, & about ten minor injuries. It was very exciting for about two hrs.\n","195":"\nThe lad that they couldn’t arrest last night, was duly arrested off the early morning parade this morning. He admits he is an out law, & gave is career as such, viz 18 months in Darlinghurst, Sydney. 6 months in Long Bay. 6 weeks in Abbasia (Australian Military gaol) & 8 weeks in a gaol at Isle of Wight, & I suppose he will receive a big term for this. The Corporal M.P. was seriously wounded, & as the mob says, served him right, as he was a rotter of the first class.\n","196":"\nI do very little work in the store now, as we are packing up a large lot of old unserviceable clothing & equipment to go back to ordnance, it is a rotten job too, as some of the old clothes would nearly \"stand up & bark at you\". You have to keep smoking to keep the smell down at times. Everything is very quiet after the riot. Rained during the day.\n\nRaining nearly all day. Still on baling up the old clothes etc, we have nearly finished now, & I am not sorry either, there were close on fifty bales altogether, I think they have been saving it all up for about 12 months. Three of us have been going some pace in supper of a night time here, the order is generally two eggs on toast, a cup of tea, raspberries & cream, & cakes, we want it too as the tucker in camp is getting worse each day.\n","197":"\nMiss Lena Ashworth’s concert party gave a turn, in the Y.M.C.A tonight, it was very good too. A big draft arrived from Australia this evening, there were about 30 a.m.c men & 20 A.M.C Officers. They report seeing wreckage & dead bodies two days from landing, & it was rumoured that the Hospital Ship \"Karoola\" was sunk. It isn’t official though.\n","198":"\nThe lad who broke the Corporal Military Police’s jaw, was identified by the corporal & arrested today. A very nice day after the rain. Had to go back to work after tea, owing to two waggons of boots, & clothes, coming in. Mending bike & acting locksmith today, the other day I was sanitary king, it is marvellous the jobs a person gets.\n","199":"\nWe have to put everything out of the hut every Saturday & scrub out. No drill is never done on a Saturday, it is considered the cleaning day.\n\nWe have a great arguing mob in the hut now, I believe they would argue on nothing. A typical argument is on the different works of Field Ambulances in the field. Nearly every one of them have been over to France. Went to the pictures in Tidworth, not too bad.\n","200":"\nRather a hot day. Felt very lazy all day, so I made my bed soon after dinner, intending to have a sleep, but the mob kept up too much noise. We have the hut full now, 28 men in all. Done some writing after tea. I received a letter from Ausy today dated April 17th. Three mails from Australia has been sunk through enemy action, & one going to Ausy, official.\n","201":"\nWrote a couple of letters, & done some washing this evening. I hate washing but owing to shortage of cash, I have to do it. Eggs, etc, for supper of a night time have been turned off, also owing to above. The lads in camp are keeping very quiet. A couple of changes have been made in the Military Police staff.\n","202":"\nThe officers in camp here are all getting horses, what for no one knows, I suppose they will be alright though, until the Officers get tired of them, a new broom always sweeps clean. We are having splendid weather now. An Australian mail came in today, dated May 27th. I have only received up to April 22nd so I can look forward for some now.\n","203":"\nA lovely day. Not feeling too good. I am on \nissue\n looking after the issue of mugs, plates, & Blankets, it will be a fairly easy job, if the Q.M does not put any more work on me. Shifted to No 28 hut this afternoon. I am there by myself. I have to be on the job. I will mess round at Q.M. Store.\n\nWas boarded (medically) this afternoon. There were two Captains & Major Stewart on the board, result classified B.1.B. & return to Weymouth, just what I wanted, it will mean a spell for a while.\n","204":"\nI have a good deal of work to do now, everything spare in all huts are being shifted to my place, I am trying to get a system to work on, & so far it seems to be working very well.\n\nWas paid £1 today. I had more in my pay book, but I though a pound would carry me safely through to next pay.\n","205":"\nAnother chap out of the store has shifted into Hut 28 with me, so I have company now. We have a fairly good mess here, of course the food is better than in the huts. All the old rubbish imaginable is being shifted round to my hut. It makes ones heart ache to look at it. It is being brought in from the other huts.\n","206":"\nStill the old rubbish comes. A couple of the huts were found to be lousy, so we have to change all the blankets, bed boards, tressels etc, a days work in itself. Not feeling too good today. There has been a lot of gambling going on since pay day, there generally is a lot, but this pay breaks the record I think.\n","207":"\nSunday is generally a quiet day. Done my washing this morning, I make it a point to do it always on a Sunday morning. Raining all this afternoon so could not go out anywhere. Stopped at home & had a good sleep. Answered a couple of letters I received through the week. Five marched in this evening, from Australia.\n","208":"\nRaining nearly all day. Very busy cleaning up all the old rubbish from all the other huts, it is being concentrated in my hut, & a rotten job it is too. General muster parade held this morning, a chap out of this camp was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, for breaking gaol last June, forging passes, absent without leave, & resisting arrest. His setence was read out on the parade, I suppose to set an example to the rest. He got all he deserved anyhow. Not feeling too well today.\n","209":"\nNot much doing today, nearly all the cleaning up finished. A new system of dining has been instituted in camp here. Separate huts have been set aside as mess huts, & permanent mess orderlies do all the work. I suppose our mess will now be done away with. It will save a lot of bother though, as all you have to do is to go in & have your meal & come out again. The food is served up ready, & the orderlies do the washing up after you. Raining again today. The Lieutenant Q.M. has apparently quietened down to his job, as he does not torment us so much now.\n","210":"\nRaining nearly all day. Very strong cold wind blowing too. The more I see of this job, the more I hate it, & wont be sorry when I have to go to Weymouth, expecting to go any day now. Haven’t had any Australian mail for a long time now. Went to concert in C of E Hut, & very good too.\n","211":"\nStill raining, & very cold. The idea of messing is a great success. Our little mess in the Q.M. Store had to be broken up, as absolutely everyone is to dine in the new mess huts.\n","212":"\nCame out sunshiney this morning but cloudy this afternoon. Very busy folding up blankets nearly all day, another chap & I folded in all twelve hundred, so we had the day cut out. They are folded in tens & stacked.\n","213":"\nRaining nearly all day, came down rather heavy this afternoon. It is supposed to be the heaviest rain in England, for fourteen years. It is very muddy everywhere. Very quiet day.\n","214":"\nVery quiet all day. Bar for four men who marched in this morning, I had nothing to do. We are getting fairly good food here now since the mess huts have started.\n","215":"\nA very fine day. The weather has seemed to take a change after all the rain we have had. Handed in Pay book this morning, as we are to be paid on Thursday. Went for a walk over to Cholderton this afternoon, very quiet place though. There is only about \"two houses and a dog\" existing there.\n","216":"\nAll men other than \"A. class\" had to parade before the Adjutant this morning. I was about the only one that hadn’t, no body knows the reason, (silent military again). A lovely day today. Received knews that I with three others \nare\n is marching out to Weymouth tomorrow. Got my classification put in my pay book this afternoon, also received my pay book back from pay clerk as I wont be paid here on Thursday now.\n","217":"\nWas up early on account of having to go to Weymouth this morning. Said good bye to all my pals. Left Parkhouse about 8.30 am & walked to Tidworth where we caught a train to Andover. After waiting about forty minutes, we caught a train for Salisbury. We (Three privates & a staff sergeant) had two hours & a half at Salisbury, so we had a good look round the town. It is a fair sized place & seems to be well populated. M.Ps. did not trouble us at all for our passes. \n\nWe caught a train from Salisbury at 1.20 pm for Poole, where we had to again change. Couldn’t see much of Poole, as it was raining fairly hard, all the time we were there. \n\nArrived at Weymouth about 4.30 pm. \nThey\n There was a big crowd of Australians off the same train, some coming from hospital, furlough, & duty. They were all fallen in & marched to Monte Video Camp. We (the staff sergeant was in the know here, with some of the officers) caught a motor & paid our fare, it was 1\/-, so it was the cheapest in the end, as lumping two packs four miles is no joke. Alloted to huts (Tempory), after arrival here, also went through medical inspection. They are the biggest humbugs of fellows here. I have ever seen, it was fully ten o’clock, when we got back to our huts. They have wire \nmattresses\n beds, good mattresses but only three blankets. Still raining this evening.\n","218":"\nRather cold early this morning, but came out fine about 9 am.\n\nParade held at 6.45 am, & all our particulars taken, also parade held at 9 a.m, when our kits were inspected, & medical classified. I am still B.1 B. Dental parade held at 2 pm, I have to have my teeth attended to there are two of my teeth to be filled. Alloted to No 2 Company & put in hut 14. We have still got the wire mattresses & good beds. They seem a very rowdy mob in the hut, but of course a fellow can expect nothing less, seeing that every one is out of a different unit. Went to a concert in Y.M.C.A. no good.\n","219":"\nWe have only two parades a day to attend on, 6.45 am & 1.30 pm, otherwise we have nothing to do, except mess orderly about once a fortnight. Was reclassified again this morning, I am still marked the same, the Dr did not ask me many questions. Was fine until about 5 pm, when it rained fairly heavy. Went to the pictures in the Y.M.C.A. They were splendid, the best show I have seen for a long while. There is some sort of entertainment on in the Y.M.C.A. every night, (bar Sunday), including pictures twice a week . The food is very good here. We get plumb pudding for dinner every second day.\n","220":"\nRather rainy looking early, but cleared up about 8 am. Hut are scrubbed out every Saturday morning, so we all have something to do this morning. Went to Weymouth railway \n& met\n station & met Tal Robinson who came down from Bournemouth to see me. We had quite a pleasant afternoon together, she had to catch the train back at 7.15 pm. Bought two films, I am going to start taking photos again. Rained again this evening.\n","221":"\nWe play cards a good deal to pass time away, generally bridge. Went to church in the Y.M.C.A, & it was a very good service. Very nice day.\n","222":"\nHad a fire alarm today at dinner time, & it was the biggest keystone affair, I ever heard of. The O.C. was disgusted & promised us another one tomorrow. Raining again today, it is very peculiar weather here now, the boys are all wondering when we are going to have some summer. Went to see an illusionist etc, at the Y.M.C.A, & he was very good.\n","223":"\nVery fine day. Had our fire alarm as the O.C. promised yesterday, went off O.K. Everybody in the camp is looking forward to Pay day. Was reclassified today & recommended for board by Senior Medical Officer. Went up to him this afternoon, but could not be put through, we have to go up tomorrow morning now. Another fellow & I went for a very nice walk round the cliffs to Portland, (we could not go into the town owing to it being out of bounds), & back by the Weymouth road.\n","224":"\nA dirty snob of an Officer came round on inspection of huts today & owing to things not being to his liking, he put the whole Company on C.B, it hurt the troops falling in for Roll call every hour from 5 pm till 9 pm. Went up to S.M.O this morning, but as he was very busy, our board was put off till 2 pm this afternoon, went up this afternoon at 2 pm, & my word they do give you a thorough examination, also ask \nall the\n a terrible lot of questions. I got B.2B.H, so I may get back to Australia after all, of course I have to go through another board before I get on a boat roll, this class will carry me back to Ausy.\n","225":"\nOwing to yesterday C.B the hut had to be scrubbed out & everything mad spick & span this morning, then the Officer did not come round. took so photos this afternoon. I want to try the camera I bought in Parkhouse. Drizzling rain nearly all day. Pay Day today, I drew £1, although I had more in my book.\n","226":"\nWent down to Weymouth for the evening. Took my film in to get deloped. There are still a good few holiday-makers in Weymouth. Owing to us being unable to get a motor or bus we had to walk in & out, was very tired when I got back home, the distance is about 2 ½ miles.\n","227":"\nTransferred to No 4 Coy, that is the second last company you get put in before going back to Australia, the last one is at Verne, from there you go on the boat. Was boarded again this afternoon by a Major & Captain, they gave me a good examination. I think I am in the same class & previous. Shifted into No 17 hut, the hut is in No 2 Coy’s part of the camp. Went to Weymouth this evening. Photos turned out good. Got a supply of Films to take back with me.\n","228":"\nA lovely day. A boat roll was expected out today, but so far hasn’t some out, three more are expected this week. Went to church in Y.M.C.A, very good service. Played cards this afternoon. The English people here seem very fond of bike riding, as nearly every one has a bike & no wonder too as they have love smooth roads, just the thing for bike riding.\n","229":"\nThe boat roll came out this morning. There are still a good few men in camp here to go home. Had to go before the Medical Officer this morning, to see if I am fit to do gymnastics. Everyone who is going back to Australia have to do exercises, so as to develop the system, & so they would not be a cripple all their lives. I was classed as unfit to take on exercises. My word we get splendid food here, it is absolutely the best I have had in the military. The O.C. (a Colonel) personally examined the food today at dinner time.\n","230":"\n\nBoat roll called out today, but I was not on it. Went to a very good concert in the Y.M.C.A this evening. It was Miss Carroll’s party from Bournemouth, & every item was very good\n","231":"\nThe weather is quite good now. I got quite a shock this morning when I read last nights orders, & saw I was transferred from B2BH to C2H. The latter is home service in Australia, so that isn’t too bad. I also got another surprise this afternoon, when my name was called out to go to Verne, so I expect we will soon be going back to dear old Ausey.\n\nLeft Monte Video at 3 p.m. & marched to Melcombe Regis Railway station, where we entrained for Portland. From Portland to Verne it is about 2 miles, & up hill all the way, it knocked the wind out of me climbing it. Verne is right on top of a very big hill with an outlook over the sea in three directions, & Weymouth in the other. It appears that this has been an old convict place once, but has since been made into a garrison. We are camped in tents here, & there are two tents to a mess. Four blankets were issued to us, & they are needed sleeping on the ground\n","232":"\nVery windy, cold day. The wind is very strong, nearly blow you away as soon as you step outside of the tent.\n\nThere are about two thousand men here waiting to go back to Australia, & about seventeen thousand altogether, so I suppose we will have to wait a good while before we get a sight of the boat.\n\nThis camp is in a very desolate part, & the sooner I get out of it the better. I do not intend to go out to Portland or Weymouth, as climbing the hill back would be too much for me. The food we get is fairly good, & on a whole the camp isn’t too bad. It is run by non-commissioned officers, so there is a bit of \"red tape\". Went to a cinema in the Gym this evening, not too bad, the film kept breaking every now & again.\n","233":"\nIt is still very windy & cold. My word it did blow & rain last night. I was expecting the tent to blow over any minute, about seven in the lines blew over. Everyone is anxious for the expected boat-rolls to come out. Two more are expected out very soon, but then there are a terrible lot of rumors getting about. All camp is closed for leave until further orders. There is plenty of amusements in camp. Concerts etc are held in the Gym everynight.\n","234":"\nThe wind died off a little during last night. \"G\" boat roll left about 6.30 this morning, the rumor is, they are to embark at Plymouth. \"I\" Boat-roll was called out today, I was not on it. Between 800 & 900 were picked, 900 more are expected to be picked for \"J\" boat roll tomorrow, I hope I am on it. It is very cold tonight.\n","235":"\nNo boat roll today. These boat rolls are the typical talk of the camp just at present, everybody seems anxious to get on one, we are all tied with the one brush I think, all anxious to get home. The food isn’t very good here, & there isn’t much either. The wind has risen again, & by the look of things rain is going to set in.\n","236":"\nWas put on fatigue duty today. Had to carry fat from the cook house to the boiler down. There was only about half an hours work. No fatigue lasts long here owing to so many being put on the jobs. Raining nearly all day & the wind is still blowing. Went to a concert in the Gym. The party was from Bournemouth, & not up to much.\n","237":"\nExceptionaly windy all day. It was very difficult to walk outside, rain also came with the wind, & it was like getting hit with small stones, to be caught in the rain, the wind was blowing that strong. Just as we were about to start breakfast, our tent blew over, upset all our breakfast, & blew everything all over the place, there was a terrible mix up; as luck happened it was not raining.\n\nTransferred from \"A\" to \"B\" Group, & from the tents into the barrack huts, no one was sorry either I think. The huts are very comfortable. Twenty men & a corporal is in a hut, so we have plenty of room. Everything in the hut is very convenient, & beds are provided.\n\nEveryone one was put on pulling down tents, it was a very rough job in the wind, I soon done a get away. Most of the tents were pulled down, but a good few still remains.\n\nReceived another Australian letter today.\n\nRumor of another boat roll coming out this week, it is still the general talk in camp, & is like a fire it soon spreads.\n\nI met a couple of fellows from Katoomba in camp here today. No matter where one goes, he always finds somebody he knows.\n","238":"\nStill very windy & raining. We get better food in the hut than we received in the tents. Two permanent mess orderlies are on, & all we have to do, is just to have our meals, the orderlies do all the washing up. Was on coal & fat fatigue again today. Cinema in the Gymnasium tonight, not too bad.\n","239":"\nAbout a hundred marched in from Monte Video & Westham camp this afternoon. I knew a couple that came in including Bill Freeman, he is marked B2B, & has had his final board. The Red Cross people came out here this morning, they come out every thursday. I got a cake of shaving & toilet soap, some tooth powder & tooth brush. They had a good few small items. Capt Storey’s party gave a concert in the Gym this evening, not up to much. Picked for guard this afternoon for tomorrow.\n","240":"\nWent to guard at 9 am. It is dinkum guard here, we have to use the rifle & Bayonet. I was put on hospital guard, we had to guard the infectious hospital. Done 5 till 9 pm shift, it is a very easy job. It was a fine day all day. There were about 400 men, N.C.O’s, & Officers came in from Pesham Downs, this afternoon. \n","241":"\nDone guard from 8 till 9 am, so we only done five hrs guard \nat\n in twenty four. Dismounted guard at 9 am. Very windy & wet again. Went down to Portland this afternoon. It was very quiet down there though. Nearly killed me walking up the hill home.\n","242":"\nWent to church in the Gym, was lucky enough to get an arm chair (supplied by the Australian Red Cross) & slept nearly all through the service, a thing I have never been guilty in my \nlife\n advanced life before. Went to Portland & back via Easton this afternoon, both places are very quiet. A very fine day.\n","243":"\nA lovely day. They are the biggest messers about I have ever seen, in this camp. Two muster parades were held today what for goodness only know. It is a dreadfully camp. Colonel Spencer-Brown (the C.O.) inspected the camp this afternoon. There are about 2500 here, but a lot of those are B1B & B1a class. Boat rolls are the topical conversation in camp.\n","244":"\nA very fine day. Had nothing to do all day, so I came off lucky. Went to Easton this afternoon, but it is very quiet in there.\n","245":"\nWas fine this morning, but rained nearly all this afternoon, & also came over very misty. I have been playing billiards constantly this last few days, & am getting quite an expert at it. The Red cross has two fine tables in this camp. Went to the pictures in the Gym this evening, not too bad. Picked for guard for tomorrow.\n","246":"\nWent on guard 9 a.m this morning on the detached guard. There are only three sentries, a corporal & a mess orderly. I was mess orderly, but all the jobs were very easy. The sentries only done 4 hrs 40 mts out of the 24 hrs. Doing mess orderly for the five was very easy. Went to the pictures in the Gym tonight. They were not up to much, but a couple of hrs can be passed away going to things like that in this camp.\n","247":"\nCame off Guard 9 am this morning. The five of us volunteered to take it on every second day permanent, but we were not allowed.\n\nA boat roll of about 180 was picked this morning. I was not on it. It is supposed to be orderlies to go back on a hospital ship, so I am not sorry I \nwas\n not on it.\n\nWent on my first route march in this camp this afternoon, & my word I was tired when I came home. We went to Easton & back. Rather a long way for a march.\n\nWe are having very fine weather now.\n","248":"\nWent to Easton again on a route march. We didn’t go so far as we did yesterday.\n\nEverybody is expectant of a boat roll about the 16th of this month.\n\nHad a look round the Portland jail this afternoon. We couldn’t go in though.\n","249":"\nVery misty & raining. Went to church in the Gym this morning. Played cards (Bridge) all the rest of the day. When leave is granted to Weymouth now, you have to be fallen in & marched to Portland where you are put in the train. Leave (daily) is now granted from 4 pm till 9.30 pm, before it was 3 pm till 10 pm.\n","250":"\nNot a bad day. Feeling very sick, I have rather a heavy cold, & a terrible head-ache. Rumor of a boat-roll coming out on Friday. Supposed to be fourteen hundred on it. Went to a place called Weston, it is right on the end of this Island, & is about four miles away. We were very tired when we came back.\n","251":"\nWe were all called out for our pay books again today, & still mine has not yet come back. My word I was wild too. The Sergeant promised to try & get it for me. Went to a concert in the Gym. The party was from Bournemouth & wasn’t too bad either.\n","252":"\nWe have a route march every morning now & sometimes of an afternoon. We generally go on the same route every day, a distance I suppose of about 3 miles.\n\n320 came into camp this afternoon, there are now about 2500 in camp here. It is just about full now. Went and had a look at the Easton gaol this evening, but there was nothing to see bar a very high stone wall. \n","253":"\nVery misty. Everyone is looking forward to pay day now, boat rolls are out of the question. Went to the pictures in the Gym, not too bad.\n","254":"\nI don’t know what I will do if I don’t get my pay book back befor Monday, which is pay day, as I have only got four penny stamps now. Tal Robinsons sends me down a good few cigarettes. Still very misty, at times you could hardly see your hand in front of you. This is supposed to be a very big base, but nearly all the guns are now dismounted. I saw where some 12.5 guns were mounted, but they had been old muzzle loaders. Seven years supply is supposed to be here, in case of a blockade.\n","255":"\nIt was a lovely day today, one could not wish for better. The weather is very changeable here now. It came over very misty tonight. Went for a walk to Portland, but it was very quiet down there. It was a very big strain coming back up the hill.\n","256":"\nMisty nearly all day. Was put on Quartermasters fatigue so I never went to church. Went out picking blackberries this afternoon, there are a good few bushes about here, but many berries. They are not in comparison with the blackberries in Australia, rather small, with hardly any taste ot juice.\n","257":"\nStill misty windy & cold. All clocks were put back an hour this morning at 2 am, on account of the \"daylight saving system\". It is the end of the summer, but from what I can see of it we haven’t had any summer yet. Pay day today, but has my pay book hasn’t come back yet I couldn’t draw any. Went to see Dr Lynn a conjurer in the Gym this evening he was very good.\n","258":"\nThe wet & cold weather has apparently set in, as there seems no hope of it breaking. This camp is just about full now. There are a good few \"big heads\" today, after yesterday.\n","259":"\nWe haven’t has a route march for about three days now on account of the wet weather, but we do fatigue duty every day, it only amounts to about an hours work though, so we don’t do too bad. It is very miserable in this \"prison\" in wet weather. Rained fairly hard nearly all day. Went to pictures in Gym tonight, not too bad.\n","260":"\nThere was a double event in the gymnasium today. A concert party from the Jubilee Theatre, Weymouth, gave a turn this afternoon, & there was a cinema in the night. The concert party were very good. Got my pay book back. Credit of £4\/16\/8. Handed it back for pay.\n","261":"\nIt was grand weather today. Very quite in camp. A conjurer gave a turn in the gym tonight, he was very good. I had a debit of 5\/9 in my pay book, it was for a hat lost in Egypt 18 months ago.\n","262":"\nWas paid thirty shillings today, & my word I needed it too, as I was on my last penny. Went down to Portland this afternoon, it is a very quiet town though.\n","263":"\nWe are having fine weather now. Was detailed for fatigue this morning but when we got on the job, we were not needed so we went for a walk round the rampart. There is some very pretty scenery around here. One very interesting part, was a seaplane rising & alighting on the water. Went out & got a few blackberries this afternoon, they weren’t up to much though.\n","264":"\nA beautiful day. A boat roll of about 500 was called out today. I was not on it. Another one is expected out on Wednesday next. It was \"L\" boat roll, so I could not expect to be on it. I am expecting to be on \"J\".\n","265":"\n\"J\" boat roll was called this morning, & as I expected, I am on it. There are about 800 on it, out of this camp. The next boat roll is expected to clear the camp out. Went through medical inspection this morning, & kit inspection this afternoon. I had to hand back a pair of boots, a tunic, jack knife, & knife, folk & spoon. Everyone seems to be very pleased to be on the roll. A Bournemouth party gave a concert in the gym this evening, they weren’t too bad.\n","266":"\n \"L\" boat roll left early this morning to embark. We are expecting to leave tomorrow morning. Very dull & wet day. A party from the Pavillion Theatre, Weymouth gave a concert in the Gym this afternoon, they were very rough.\n\nReceived orders tonight, reveille 3.30 am tomorrow morning, breakfast 4 am, so we will have to be up pretty early.\n","267":"\nUp at 3.30 this morning, & it was cold getting out too. Had breakfast at 4 am. 90 out of the alphabetical order of A’s & B’s marched out at 4.30 am. They went to make up the full train load from Monte Video. We fell in at 6 am, & after the roll call, receiving of rations, & boat tickets, we marched out at 7.30 am. The Verne Band played us down to Portland Railway station. entrained at Portland & left at 9 am. It was a very long train & necessitated two engines to pull it. \n\nWe had about 25 minutes at Exeter, where a cup of tea & a bun was supplied to us, by the Mayoress & committee of Exeter. Altogether it was a very nice train ride. Arrived in Plymouth about 5.20 p.m. detrained & went aboard the \"Suevie\". Seems to be a very nice boat. It tonage is about 13,000 tons, & can do about 12 knots. There are about 1400 troops on board. I am at 57 table on D. deck. Of course everything is in a muddle for the first. Issued with two blankets & a hammock, but as I could never sleep in a hammock I will have to sleep on the floor.\n","268":"\nVery cloudy & misty this morning, left the dock at 9 am & pulled into the stream. There are a good few war vessels of all kinds in harbour here, the only thing I haven’t seen here yet is a submarine. Everything is being prepared for us to sail. Plymouth is a lovely Harbour, very spacious & pretty. Weighed anchor at 3 pm & went just outside the harbour, sailed at 5 pm.\n\nWe have a cruiser in front of us, a transport with British troops for Mesopotamia, & Transport A.30 \" \" behind us. Either side we have five destroyers, so we seem well protected. The sea is fairly calm, but the first day out you know, I feel a bit squirmish. Last saw England about 6.30 pm. Everything is very convenient on board. There are half a dozen different hospital on board. There are a few Nurses, & a fairly large staff. There is a Y.M.C.A, & canteen, but the latter does not open until tomorrow. We have to be out a certain radius before anything can be sold. Permanent mess orderlies were appointed today. It was decided to pay them a shilling a week each man for the voyage.\n","269":"\nFeeling crook this morning. Altho the sea isnt very rough, I suppose it was through sleeping below, as it is very stuffy & hot down there. I feel as if I dont want to eat anything & the mere talk of going below makes me shudder. I haven’t vomited yet tho. A pal of mine brought up my tea & bed, so I am set now until tomorrow. We have six destroyers & a battle cruiser with us now. One of the destroyers started firing at something just after dinner, at first of course all thought it was a submarine, but later it was found out to be some wreckage they were breaking up, so as not to cause injury to any other boat.\n\n My cobber & myself have a sleeping posey on No 2 hatch, no more sleeping blow for mine. Everybody is looking forward to some pay, the rumor is they are going to give us a pound & two pounds worth of canteen chits, but I dont think the troops will stand for it as they like to have the hard cash. Things are very cheap in the canteen. I suppose it is because there is no duty: Tobacco & cigarettes are exceptionally cheap, tobacco is 6d for 2 oz tin, cigarettes 2d per packet.\n\nPOSITION OF SHIPS IN CONVOY\n\nAuxiliary Cruiser\n\n(\"Derwent Castle\")\n\n\"S.S. Borderer\". \"S.S. Suevic\". \"Balmoral Castle\". \"Hororata\".\n","270":"\nSea is fairly calm. The last of the escort left us about 6 am this morning, so we have only four boats & an Auxilliary Cruiser now, the last mentioned picked us up during the night. Church parage was held on No 3 hatchway, of course all attended. (Church of England). We get fairly good food, & the best of bread, well in fact it is absolutely the best I have had since I left Australia. The Red Cross have issued out games \nto\n etc to each table. Very cloudy. No feeling too bad today.\n","271":"\nThe sea was like a mill pond, there was hardly a ripple, & it was a beautiful day, altho tonight it looked very much like rain, it frightened us from sleeping on deck. Received Red Cross issue today, it included 2 suits pyjamas, 2 prs socks, 2 cakes soap, 2 towels, chocolate, writing paper, & pencil, I shirt & undershirt, 1 underpants, & a pr of deck shoes, so we didn’t do too bad. A concert was held on No 3 hatchway (for’ard) this evening. We have some fair artists on board. By all appearance we are going to have a decent journey.\n","272":"\nThe weather is getting very much warmer now, I suppose we will be getting it very hot soon. The crew thinks it will take us about 8 weeks to reach Sydney, something to look forward too. The food is keeping very decent on board. Rained fairly heavy this evening. We just had our beds made on the hatchway, when the rain started to come down, of course we had to go below then to sleep. It was terrible hot & stuffy down there.\n","273":"\nThis is a very good life. All the fatigues are permanent, so I haven’t had anything to do & by appearances I wont have anything to do, not if I can help it. We play cards all day to pass away the time, generally Bridge.\n","274":"\nThe sea here is very blue, about the bluest I have seen it. Awnings have been but over nearly all the hatchway, & ventilators put down into the lower decks. One can now raise a perspiration, without doing anything.\n","275":"\nNo 4, 5 & 6 Military Districts (South, West Australia & Tasmania) were paid today. 10\/- only being paid. A shilling per man is being deducted for breakages etc caused during the voyage, It is an enormous amount to deduct, & the mob are kicking up a row about it. The Officer explained the reason for deduction & said a committee would be appointed to decide what would be done with the suppluc cash after the fee had been paid. We are given a lot of liberty on the ship, one can go & do nearly just as he likes.\n","276":"\nWe have got into the land (or sea rather) of the flying fish. Very big schools of them were observed nearly all day. They are mavellous, & some can fly a long distance out of the water. They are very small. Also saw a couple of sharks go by. A concert was held on No 3 hatchway this afternoon, we haven’t very good talent on board. A few of the items were very funny though.\n","277":"\nChurch parade was again held on No 3 hatchway. They only have Church of England & R. Catholic on board. It gets very monotonous on board during the days. We get wireless news every day.\n","278":"\nThe sea was like a sheet of glass all day. Rained very heavy this afternoon, one of those tropical showers, came very quick, & was over just as quick. We are expecting to be in Sieraleone tomorrow morning. Paid 10\/- this morning. 1\/- was deducted for breakages etc during voyage.\n","279":"\nArrived Sierra Leone about 8 am. It is a very pretty Harbour on one side, being very rugged, but on the other side it is all low marshy ground. It is a great place for malaria fever, & no white man can live here any length of time. The natives here seem to be of a very big build, & muscular race. A great number came out in canoes, & was diving for any coins which was thrown into the water. They are very good divers & swimmers. Their canoes are very light crafts, & they can be sent along at a great rate. Some of the natives haven’t a stitch of clothing on, while\n\nTuesday Oct 9th Con.\n\nothers have next to nothing on. Souvenirs & fruit is also brought out, & they know how to charge too. A fellow is very foolish to purchase souvenirs, as he cannot see what he is buying, until he has bought it. Fruit (Bananas, oranges. African pears, & cocoa-nuts) is very dear too considering, but then I suppose it is their own price.\n\nA concert was held this evening; It was very good considering our talent on board. The Captain of the ship lent us the bunting, which was done up very good.\n\nHad to sleep below owing to very heavy rain this evening.\n","280":"\nThere has been some very funny happenings with the natives in their canoes, such as pelting them with rotten potatoes etc or emptying wash water over them. A couple occurrences were dead funny. The hose was put all over a mob of them this morning. The \"heads\" tried to stop the troops from buying fruit off of the natives, as fever etc could be carried onto the boat that way, they succeeded a couple of times. All the Officers & nurses went ashore this morning & evening, poor privates again, have to stop on board, no hope of us going ashore here.\n","281":"\nA more strict watch was kept over the natives selling fruit etc to the troops today, by Officers & the provost staff. Very few things were sold by the natives. Sultan of Egypt reported dead today. Nearly everyone is getting about with only a pair of \"shorts\" & a shirt on, owing to the very hot weather.\n","282":"\nThe natives keep well away from the boat now through being so constantly pelted at & hurt by the military police. A good deal of gambling goes on since pay day, one fellow was caught & got 7 days detention. The guns of the fort here were practicing today, some fairly good shots could be observed.\n","283":"\nWas 21 years old today. Left Sierra Leone about 2.30 pm this afternoon. Sea was very calm. We have a different \"Cruiser\" with us this time & one more ship.\n","284":"\nChurch was held on No 3 hatchway. All of the ships crew always fall in on their life boats every Sunday morning. The different mileages are on the back of this book, we are averaging about 300 miles in the 24 hours.\n","285":"\nVery windy today. Sea moderate. Crossed the line at 4.30 pm, no celebration held. We never have a roll call now, I suppose the sergeants have got too lazy.\n","286":"\nWe get three packets of cigarettes or 2 ozs of tobacco, & a box of matches once a week from the red cross society. All the convoy is keeping well together.\n","287":"\nHad to shift off the hatch last night owing to the rain, very quite aboard. Had a tooth pulled out today & my word it did hurt. It was a very long rooted tooth, & my gum had to be torn to get it out. My mouth was very swollen & \nvery\n sore all day. The Dentist broke the tooth 3 times before he eventually pulled it.\n","288":" \n\nToday was on the cold side 75 degrees on the thermometer, very windy too. A few are feeling sea-sick today, for a wonder I am O.K. The sea is choppy with a fair swell. My mouth is still very sore.\n","289":"\nVery quite. The Cruiser & H.M.T \"Hororata\" has left us, this \nevening\n afternoon they were just visible on the horizon in front of us. Both came back about half past five this afternoon.\n","290":"\nVery cold weather, the thermometer dropped to 60 degrees. Where everyone was wearing practically nothing a week ago, they are wearing overcoats now. One of the transports, which is carrying native troops stopped to bury two this morning. The whole convoy practically stopped too. It appears the transport had to stop & turn round facing the sun to bury the natives according to their religion.\n","291":"\nIt gets very monotonous on the boat at times, one hardly knows what to do. A fine afternoon, after the cold weather we have been having. Church was held on No 3 hatch. Capetown is all the talk now.\n","292":"\nThe Priest (Roman Catholic) on board is a hard case. A real fine fellow. He came down & had dinner with the boys on our deck today, of course everyone was good. Was paid £1 today.\n","293":"\nPte W. Castles, of the 54th Btn died suddenly this afternoon. Sea very choppy with a fair swell. Extremely windy & cold.\n","294":"\nVery windy today but not so cold. Pte Castles was buried \"at sea\" this morning at 11 am, full military honors. L\/cpl D’Arcey died of pneumonia this afternoon.\n","295":"\nLand (South Africa) was sighted about midday. Sea is very choppy, with a South Easterly blowing. Very cold. Arrived at Capetown about 4 pm & pulled into the Harbour about 6 pm. It is a very small crampy harbour, but has a good few wharves. The whole convoy went into harbour soon after arrival. Capetown is right at the foot of Table Mountain & Lion’s Head Mountain. A very stiff wind was blowing all the evening. The Officers & nurses went ashore soon after arrival, we are to get leave tomorrow. Coaling operations and watering was commenced as soon as we had made fast to the wharf. Niggers do the coaling. Everything on the boat is smothered in coal dust.\n","296":"\nEvery one is very busy preparing to going ashore. Leave is granted from 9 am till 11 pm. We got punctually off the boat at 9 am & walked up to the centre of Capetown, a distance of about 2 miles. Capetown is a very nice City, with a fairly large population chiefly consists of Dutch & half castes, & I can safely say, that every other nationality is represented, of course, bar those of the enemy. \n\nThe streets are nice wide & cleanly kept. There are some very fine buildings here especially the G.P.O. etc. The people seem to be on very good terms with the Australians. My pal & I were rather fortunate. A Lady, by name Mrs Morton invited us out to an Hotel she is staying at. She is a Tasmanian Lady & is down from Johannesburg on a holiday. We had a very pleasant time at the Hotel (boarding only), of course we felt out of place sitting down to a six & eigth course meal, everything was made very homely for us. \n\nWent to Camp Bay in the afternoon, it is about an hour & a half in the tram, very picturesque and a most pleasant ride, supposed to be one of the best in the world. After tea we went to the Tivoli Theatre.\n\nFriday Oct 26th Cont.\n\nIt was rather poor. After we had supper at the Alexander Café & then motored back to our ship. It is absolutely the best days outing I have spent for a very long while, thanks to Mrs Morton, Miss Stevenson & another girl friend. We were very sleepy & tired upon arrival back at the boat. The Gardens in Capetown are lovely. Wages are very good here. Things are rather dear. No food restrictions through the war.\n","297":"\nSailed at 7 am this morning, I am very sorry our stay in Capetown was so short. A week could have easily been spent there without seeing the same thing twice. It is still windy & rather cold. As planned yesterday, if we were to sail today, the girls waved a goodbye on the heliograph. There was rather a heavy swell on this afternoon. I was sea-sick after tea.\n","298":"\nFeeling sick today. Very quite.\n","299":"\nA very heavy swell on today, I am feeling fairly well. There are a good few sea-sick. The wind is very strong & cold. It is very funny when the boat rolls, especially below deck, everything is rolling from one side to the other, fellows are trying to walk along, & only manage by short runs.\n","300":"\nA sweep is got up every day on the distance the boat travels every day, the winner gets about 30\/-. I haven’t go in for any yet. Feeling very crook today.\n","301":"\nStill very windy with a heavy swell on. There are a good number sea-sick on board. I am feeling fairly well today. Kit inspection held today, we hadn’t to empty out our kits though. Concert held on No 3 hatch. The party is now known as the \"Pierrots\".\n","302":"\nWe have two sweeps being got up on the Melbourne Cup. First prize is £20 2nd £5 3rd £2.10.0. The tickets costs 2\/6 each. I am not in for one.\n","303":"\nThe ship made its record run for 24 hours today, 320 miles. It will be O.K. if that can be kept up.\n\nSaturday No","304":"\nToday was the best day we have had since leaving Capetown. The wind had practically died down.\n","305":"\nRaining nearly all day. Sea is very choppy today. We still have the flock of birds following us. It is marvellous the distance they follow a boat. They seem to go all the time without a spell. They \nseem to\n glide through the air for miles, flapping their wings occasionly.\n","306":"\n\"Napoo\".\n","307":"\nWent before the Dr This morning. He only asked a few questions, & wrote \nsomething\n on my board papers. About the quietest day. I have spent on board. Everyone anxious of news of \"Melbourne Cup\".\n","308":"\nStill a very heavy swell on. This is a great old boat to roll. The wind is blowing behind us, we also have the current in our favour.\n","309":"\nDeck billiards are all the go now. A good few matches have been played. Kept down below all day, as it was very windy & cold up on top.\n","310":"\nMuch better day. Sea much calmer. Expect to be in Fremantle on Monday morning. All the winches & ropes have been got ready to start operations as soon as we arrive in port.\n","311":"\nIt was a very nice day today. The best we have had since leaving Capetown. Numerous comical posters have been put up, about different states. West Australia, Victoria & N.S.W. have suffered most. We have an artist on board, & he has contributed a good few very funny sketches.\n","312":"\nThe weather is just the reverse to yesterday. It is a very dull cold day.\n","313":"\nRotnest Island was sighted about 9.30 am. Anchored just outside Fremantle Harbour. Dr came on board & examined every man. Entered the Harbour & pulled alongside the wharf about 2 p.m. Red Cross Ladies brought flowers, fruit, cakes, books & papers on board, all were very acceptable. \n\nAll West Australians disembarked about 3.30 pm. The \"Borderer\" arrived about an hour before us. Sailed 5 pm this afternoon. Colonel Meeks our O.C. disembarked at Fremantle, we lose in him a very good O.C. & gentleman. It was a grand day. There were very few people on the wharf to see the ships in.\n\nWe took on Westralian reinforcements to 4th Div Sig & flying Corps, for training in Melbourne. Also five New Zealanders returning to New Zealand\n","314":"\nIt was a lovely day. Slight swell on, but not a ripple on the water. Land in sight all day. We have some beautiful big albatrosses following us. Some are very big.\n","315":"\nSouth Australia, Victoria & Tasmania is getting paid today. We have to have all our things fumigated today, & it is about time some of them was fumigated too, by the scratchings of the fellows.\n","316":"\nVery big swell on today. Very choppy too. Two whales were sighted on the Starboard side & three on the Port side this morning. Paid £1 today. This completes our full payment for the voyage.\n","317":"\nRough sea today. Very windy & cold.\n","318":"\nMuch better today. Cape Otway was sighted just after dinner. Victorians, S. Australians & Tasmanians are all getting ready to go off tomorrow, We are expecting to be in Melbourne tomorrow morning. It remains a mystery whether we N.S.Welshmen are to go overland from Melbourne, or by boat. Concert held on No 3 hatchway this evening. It was very good, & the bunting was splendid.\n","319":"\nWe went through the Port Phillip Heads about 6 am. Of course everybody was up by that time. Some had been up since 2 am. Great excitement on board. Arrived in Port Melbourne about 8 am. The quarantine Doctor came on board & examined us all. Apparantly we came in a day before our time as the Dr said we were not expected until tomorrow. \n\nAll the Victorians, S. Australians & Tasmanians were preparing to go off all the morning. Pulled into the wharf just at dinner time. Great was our surprise when we (N. S. Welshmen & Queenslanders) received half an hours notice to hand in all our thing & be prepared to disembark straight away. I was mess orderly, but we \nleft\n let all the cleaning up rip when the above order came out.\n\nSunday Nov. 18th Cont -\n\nQueenslanders went off first, then we followed, it was about half past one then. A long string of motor cars were waiting to take us away. I got in a lovely motor car, the Driver informed us we were going to the Cauldfield Hospital. We received a very good reception, cigarettes, fruit & lollies along the road. The day was beautiful & we had a glorious ride to Cauldfield, a distance of about eight miles. Cauldfield Hospital is a fine place. It was good o, having a nice bed to sleep in once again. We were given a bonza dinner upon our arrival here.\n\nLeave was given us from about 3 pm until 10 pm. My pal & myself went out to St Kilda, & had a very decent time in Melbourne. It was hard luck though all the shops, etc, being closed, anyhow we made the best of it. We got back to Hospital about half past ten dead tired. I have a much better opinion of Melbourne this time, than when we called here on our way over. We are expecting to leave for Sydney tomorrow at mid-day. I much prefer the train journey to the boat. They have fine streets in Melbourne. Their trams are very small though.\n","320":"\nA lovely day. Had dinner at 10.30 am, so as to enable us to get away early. We were taken down to Elsternwick railway station by motor, but as the trains were delayed three quarter of an hour, we were taken back to the hospital, & brought back again, an hour later. I was lucky enough to get on the first train. (there were two) We were put in first class carriages, which were very comfortable, The Red Cross, kept up a good supply of cigarettes, cakes, sweets, & drinks, also a pair of light slippers to wear in the train. \n\nWe received a very good reception all along the line, arrived in Albury about 9 pm. We left Melbourne at 2 pm. A very good spread was waiting for us at Albury. We then entrained on the New South Wales side in Red Cross train. Beds were already made. The vestibules had once been","321":" class sleeping compartments, so you can guess how comfortable we were. Every big station we called at, there were crowds of people to welcome us, & give us sweets, cigarettes, flowers, cakes, biscuits, & tea. A good many were enquiring after different fellows on the train, but it was like looking for a needle in a haystack, & there were five trains.\n","322":"\nWe had breakfast at Moss Vale. The Red cross supplied us with plenty of flowers, fruit etc. Received a good \"welcome home all along the line, especially going through the suburbs. We arrived in Sydney three quarters of an hour early, better early than late though. We pulled in No 19 platform. Disentrained & was taken \nfrom\n per motor cars from the station to the Domain, where there was a big crowd awaiting our arrival. My Father & Sister Olive came to meet me, think I was a little overjoyed also my people. \n\nWe were paid £2 & our pay books taken. After having some lunch we went & caught the 1.30 pm train for home, arrived home at 3.30 pm, & of course got a very good welcome home, & now for telling long yarns, having innumerable conversations & answering questions etc. So ends a long & exciting trip to the Great European war of 1914 - \n","323":"\nBill Brown came down from Hurstville to stop until Wednesday with me. Had a very decent time. I went up to his place from Wednesday afternoon until Saturday afternoon.\n\n"}}
