Camp at Moore Park Engineers Depot and marched through a dark and \"dead\" city to Woolloomooloo Bay wharf. A few friends of the departing boys joined up at the camp and marched along with the company to the wharf to take their long, last farewell; to some, forever. Anxious heads peered through lighted curtains in houses along the route to say Good-Bye to some they may know. The quiet and darkness of the route at this hour, which was in the vicinity of 4 a.m. was quite in keeping to the thoughts and feelings of the men as they trudged the streets of their beloved city, many for the last time, though none of them knew it, on their way to some foreign strand where they were to come face to face with their destiny, many with their creator, while undergoing the acid test of war. None of us knew exactly to what we were going, none cared for the consequences. All we knew, as we marched through the Gates of the docks at Woolloomooloo, was that we were badly wanted over \"somewhere\", that our cause was right and that, come what may, our country and those that it held that were very dear to us at the moment, were worth any sacrifice or price that we might be asked to pay.\n\nWe embarked on one of the Sydney Ferries and left the wharf for H.M.T. \"Marathon\" which was lying off Clark Island, in the stream. There were a good number of Queensland men on the ship when we reached here but we were detailed to our troop decks and were soon at home on the ship that was to be our home for the next month or so. At 4.30 pm., the ship weighed anchor and made for Sydney heads. At last we all felt that we were indeed going to war, for the atmosphere and discipline on board the transport left you with no other impression than that you were soldiers and had to do as you were commanded, from this day forth. On the whole, the transport was a good ship and our quarters were clean and there was nothing objectionable, even to a critical mind. We cleared the heads at about 5 pm., Easy sea. Developed a sick headache from want of something to eat. Got better as night came on. Turned into bed after a sleep on deck, through the mess, of about an hour.\n","2":"\n\nSea calm. Feel well again. Comforts handed out on deck. Had haircut by Norman Walker. Air getting\n","3":"\n ","4":"\n\ncolder as we go south. After tea had a game of Five Hundred with some of the boys. Turned in and slept well.\n","5":"\n\nHave run into a little weather with head wind and rough sea. Feeling o.k\n","6":"\n\nSea easy again. Infantryman died and was buried at sea with full military honours.\n","7":"\n\nEighth day out from Sydney. Arrived Fremantle and anchored in the stream at 6 a.m. Good weather, but hot and sultry. Steamer was granted pratique. General shore leave granted from 8 am till 6 pm. Left steamer with chum Larsen and Norman Walker ar 10.15 and arrived Fremantle station at 10.30, having come ashore in a motor launch. Paid 1\/- launch and train fares both ways. Entrained for Perth in special, arriving there at 11 am. Sent telegrams home. Went into Ice Cream shop for cool drinks and wrote cards and letters home. Had Dinner at Moana Cafe. Had a good grill and enjoyed the diversion from transport food. After the meal, had a stroll round Perth then went for motor ride through King's Park which took but half an hour. Raining nearly all the time. Enjoyed and appreciated the magnificent views of Perth and its environs from the park. Had Tea. Bought provisions and comforts for Mess and caught special train for Fremantle on the return. Train was jammed. Lots of men \"tanked\". Douglas landed back injured and went into hospital. Arrived back on ship again at 6.45 feeling tired, but having enjoyed the day immensely. Wrote diary and turned in. While in Perth I called on Harry Crust at the Pavilion Theatre. Was shown over his theatre.\n","8":"\n\nSailed from Fremantle at 4pm. People gave us a great send off. Crowds lined the shore. Boats whistled, trains whistled, crowds cheered as did the soldiers on our boat, and the \"Argyllshire\" alongside. After tea, had some harmony for an hour or two. Sea a little rough.\n","9":"\n\nFine day. Sea smooth again. Did nothing in morning. Comforts from Comforts Committee were opened. Got my share of cigarettes, fruit, biscuits, Milk, Jam, etc in plenty. We all gave cheers for the good old Comforts people.\n","10":"\n\nSea somewhat moderated on yesterday's showing. Spent most of day at Morse signalling and watching teams train for coming sports competitions on the morrow. Had a box with Norman Walker. Have seen nothing at sea since we left Fremantle. Held third concert at night. Great success. Did \"Dandy Fifth\" and \"Ode to Kitchener.\" Got 2 printed souvenir programs to send home.\n\n1916\n\n\n","11":"\n\nNice day. Calm sea. Rose 6 am. Parade 6.30. Had Physical jerks till 7. Breakfast 7.15. Parade 9.30, Morse till 10.30. Practice for sports. Sports in afternoon. Tug of war and boxing bouts. Engineers won most of the events on the program. Did not take much interest and took advantage of time off to indulge in washing with Norman Walker. Got all our laundry clean. Had tea at 5. Spent evening on deck. Had instruction in repelling submarine attack. Sent first Morse message to Norman Walker since learning the code. Saw large school of porpoises during the day.\n","12":"\n\nRose 6 am. Nice day again. Sea like a mirror all day. No parade, only for washing purposes but having done mine yesterday, spent day in the shade of one of the boats on poop deck, reading \"Souls in Pawn\". In afternoon did some sewing below, cleaned leggings and boots ready for leave at the next port, wherever that might be. While there a submarine warning was sounded and I donned my belt and carried out instructions given during previous drill. Did some letter writing home. After tea went on deck and had a yarn, smoke and a sing song. Slept on poop deck for first time. Turned in about 9.30.\n","13":"\n\nFine day. Usual routine. Submarine warning and drill.\n","14":"\n\nSaturday. Did Morse in morning. Norman and I detailed for drilling holes for hammocks in girders on hospital deck. Did the job after much fussing and hard work. Had to go down into Engine Room to get tools for the work. Got scared as I passed along rows of huge moving machinery and was rather glad to get on deck again out of the clatter and heat of the engine room. After tea, ship's crew gave a concert. Did not go. Wrote letters instead.\n","15":"\n\nPut on Guard duty,","16":" time. Several men went to sleep on posts. Don't wonder. Hell of a row about it.\n","17":" 20, 21, 22\n\nUsual Routine and practice for sports competition.\n","18":"\n\nSignalling in morning. Read a buzzer for first time. Mock Trial in afternoon. Corporal Bob Beard the accused and Sapper Winterbotham the accuser. Proved immensely funny and entertaining. Sighted land at about 3 pm. Felt like one of the crew of Columbus' ship. Arrived at and anchored in Durban, Africa, at about 7 pm. Looks a very nice place from the deck. Sat on deck after tea and spent evening with George Mathieson, Walter Willey and other pals singing songs. Turned in at 9.15 on poop deck.\n","19":"\n\nWoke at 5 am. Rose and had wash and got ready for\n\n\n\nNov 24\n\nroute march. Leave granted from 1.30 till 10.30. Route march from 9.30 till noon. Quite long enough. Left ship and lined up on quay with other units, ours in the vanguard. Had inspection by M.O. and then gave salute to O.C. ship as we turned on the road leading from wharf for Durban. March was to Ocean Beach and Esplanade. Told we were going for swim, which pleased us greatly, as it was very hot and sultry and we were wet with perspiration. The swim, however, did not eventuate as the local Military Staff had not advised the proprietor of baths of our intended visit. He was unable to accommodate us. With very heavy hearts we marched back to \nship\n to be broken up for a half hour spell. Had an iced ginger beer. After a rest on the grass lawns, that flank the beach, we were formed up and marched back to the ship again for lunch. Had it. Went on deck and watched our gun being hoisted and fixed in position aft. Fell in again at 1.15 and marched from the pier to the Law Courts in Durban City. After pickets had fallen out we were dismissed on leave until 10.30. Walter Willey and I hired a Rickshaw from there and went straight to the baths for a swim. Ride cost us 1\/-. Got to baths at 3. Had nice surf bath, and a shower which was delicious. This was the first time I had felt really clean since I left home. Left baths and got another rickshaw up to the city. Joined Tim Woods, Duncan Woolley, George Mathieson, Cameron, Tom Peters and all had afternoon tea on the delightfully cool and spacious verandah of the magnificent Royal Hotel. Had first decent cup of tea since leaving Perth. Then went for roam round town. Sought and bought souvenirs. Curios out of question as regards price. In fact it cost almost 5\/- to open one's mouth in Durban. Posted letters and souvenirs home. Caught a Marriett Road Tram to the Zoo Gardens and enjoyed run on the double decker. Had tea at the Kiosk at the Gardens and came back to town by another route, gaining lovely views of the city from the heights at the back of the city. Returned to town and met Herb Larsen. Waited about an hour for Norman Walker. Not turning up we went to the Royal for Dinner which we were all eager for. After a wash and a brush up we all sat down and had a great old feed. After leaving the Royal, Herb and Woolley and I went round the town while Herb bought Xmas cards to send home. There being none worth buying I decided to leave mine until I got to Cape Town. Met Norman at 8.30 in front of G.P.O. and arranged to meet him again at 9 after he had a bath Met him at 9 and got into a cheap restaurant - which was the best that our tired legs and eyes could find - and Norman and Len Bowkett had tea. I had 2 glasses of milk and felt like a poisoned pup. Had another rickshaw ride for half an hour. Bought fruit which we greedily disposed of. Caught tram to the \"Point\" and reached the \"Marathon\" again at 10.40. Turned in and went to sleep ere long after a most happy day's fun on the whole.\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n","20":"\n\nStill in Durban. No leave granted as we are leaving for Cape Town this afternoon. Sat on poop and watched coaling operations until noon. My impression of a ship being coaled by the boys at Durban is the nearest thing to the ancient Tower of Babel that it is possible to imagine. Had dinner and went on deck to find that we were making for the open sea. When we got outside the breakwater we ran into a heavy swell. Watched the pilot being dropped and passed the Dutch steamer \"Sonoro\" on the way out.\n","21":"\n\nFine weather but we are still in the swell. Church service both morning and night. Attended both as there was nothing else to do.\n","22":"\n\nSea calm again. Sighted big steamer. Nothing of eventful nature to-day.\n","23":"\n\nFine day again. Sighted South African Coast again with its mountains and rugged landscapes. Entered Table Bay before breakfast and lay in the stream. Later moved into the pier for water. Took this and provisions on. Disappointed at not getting leave for a fly around Cape Town. Not granted as we are leaving here to-day again. Hope to get on the picket, but no luck. Picket was sent ashore. Larsen and Walker went with them. They had a swim. Walker went in with his wristlet on with fatal results - to his wristlet. Sat on deck and watched proceedings on wharf and elsewhere. Had a bird's eye view of the city at a few miles distance. Much struck with the beauty and rugged grandeur of the city of Capetown's background, which rises straight up, as a range of rugged peaks, to a height of 3,400 feet above the sea. Pulled out from wharf into stream again at 2 pm. Coal lighters came alongside. Watched the men catching young sharks from the ship's side. Found the day warm and balmy but a great improvement on the heat of Durban. Had tiffin and afterwards the Colonel gave a concert to some of his friends from shore. Did \"Gunga Din\" and \"How the Chestnut Horse came Home\". Well received. During the concert H.M.S. \"Kent\" - our convoy - and H.M.T. \"Argyllshire\" arrived in port. Then turned in on the deck, as usual and slept. Found out the real reason of leave not being granted is that men from the \"Borda\" played up while on leave and that owing to sickness on on our ship the doctor would not grant a clean ship.\n\nNov 20\n\nFine and lovely day. Cape Town looks very pretty, especially with all the vessels in the stream. The \"Argyllshire\" steamed into the pier for water. Rose 6 am as usual and looked around until 7.30 when we had breakfast. Had throat swabbed as a precaution against Meningitis and other troubles. Also a Formalin Tablet three times to-day. Our company did guard and supplied fatigues. I was on Bakery fatigues and got some bread and cakes. Also saw sports on deck. Supposed to go into the apple-bobbing race but was not on spot at the time it was held. H.M.S. \"Kent\" moved\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n","24":"\n\ninto Pier for coal. \"Argyllshire\" moved out into the stream again. Bought souvenir of Cape Town from one of the Cape boys in a boat alongside the ship, to send home.\n","25":"\n\nStill in Cape Town, in the stream. Nice day. Rose as usual at 6. Did physical jerks. Had breakfast. No parades. After breakfast, Bill Allan took the Engineers in hand for physical development for about an hour. Then read \"Ginger Mick\" to the boys on the deck at Mr. Gray's request. Much speculation and thousands of latrine wirelesses as to our probable date and time of leaving. Fed up with being in port and not being allowed on shore. Hope to sail in the morning on our last long spell of travel. There is a big storm coming at time of writing this. Cleaned up my knives and scissors with emery, on account of rust. Got an orange in a scramble on the deck this morning, which were given out by the Y.M.C.A. George Ravell made a defaulter through handing a letter to a coal lumper which contained information which was contrary to Military Orders. He was given 10 days C.B.\n","26":"\n\nRose 6 am. Ship weighed anchor at 6.15 am. On our way at 6.30 with \"Kent\" as our escort. Glad to leave Cape Town, the more at not being allowed ashore there. \"Argyllshire\", \"Boonah\", Marathon\" all in the one convoy heading for --\n","27":"\n\nNothing unusual to-day. Sea moderate. No concert. Travelling at night as a dark ship. We are now in comparative danger from submarine actions and are under strictest Naval orders. Submarine warning this morning. Gun fired for first time as a test. It shook hell out of the ship.\n","28":"\n\nSunday. Church service conducted by Walter Willey. Nothing much of any consequence to-day. Sighted the \"Argyllshire\" on starboard side. Sighted \"Argyllshire\", and \"Kent\" went out to have a peep at her through her guns. Being satisfied that she was not of enemy origin she was allowed to proceed. This caused a little concern on board when she was first sighted on the horizon. Service on poop deck in afternoon. Had a sing song after. Madden stricken down with Meningitis. Condition critical. I was awarded \"most popular artist\" prize of 10\/- for last concert held. Feel bucked.\n","29":"\n\nRose 6. Spent an hour or two practising \"Comrades in Arms\" Quartette with Edgar Rice, Walter Willey, Georg Mathison and Tm Peters for concert on night of 6th. Nothing of importance happened save that I had a BATH (as usual, in a bucket).\n","30":"\n\nRose early. Did Jerks etc. Spent most of morning at practice on songs with quartette. Had lecture on deck by Lt. Parkinson. After dinner the usual swabbing out. Jerks on deck. More practice and came on deck\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n\nDec 5\n\nto watch sports practice. Duncan Woolley got hurt in wheelbarrow race with L'Estrange. Fell on neck and face and was badly chafed and bruised. After tea went on deck and spent the rest of the daylight in playing quoits with some of the boys. Nothing very startling to-day.\n","31":"6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n\nNothing special. Concert on night of","32":" Smooth sea and weather good. Received news of fall of Bucharest to the Huns, with disgust. Entered tropics. Feel off from the time we did so as the humid heat seems unbrearable to those not accustomed to it. Had a slight touch of the sun, but quite enough to give one a good idea of what a bad stroke must be.\n","33":"\n\nEntering port again after a good spell of the sea at a navigating rate equal to the fastest speed of the slowest vessel in convoy. I should say it was about 10 knots, or less. The \"Boonah\" set the pace. Some speed. Dropped anchor. Found out that the place was none other than Free Town, the capital of British Sierra Leone. 3 pm., 12 transports in the bay. Some of them been there for two to three weeks. Hear we are likely to be in here for some time. It is stiflingly hot and sultry. I long for the cooler weather. The town on the shore at the foot of the purple hills, which rise sheer out of the sea, looks pretty with its bright reds, blues, crimsons, and the other bright colours one associates with tropical places. One can imagine the forest, that clothes these mountains, inhabited by all the wild animals and birds of prey that one has read and learned about through life. The scene is certainly a very impressive one - but to have to lie here for the rest of my life gazing at it, not for me.\n","34":"\n\nLeave granted from 11.30 until 4.30. Embarked on a barge in the boiling sun with breeches, and shirt sleeves rolled up. No tunics worn. We were kept in the barge alongside the ship for what seemed to be hours. Our eyebrows crawled with sweat. It seemed a poor omen for our visit ashore, where there could be none of the scarce perceptible breeze which wafted out across the water every now and then, as if it came from some human bellow somewhere in the distant hills. However, we at long last reached the mud of mother earth again and scrambled ashore, only too glad to be able to get real dirt on our hands once again after about 3 weeks on the water. We did not find Free Town what we had thought it. It was not a modern town at all, as its appearance from the ship suggested; but a dirty lot of old hovels and brothels infested by blacks of all grades and nationalities, it seemed, but, for the most part, low and immoral. In fact, the natives here have no morals at all and make no pretension at having any, even from the children up. Although it does not strike one as a pity, for they appear so black as to be almost akin to the animal. At mid-day we hunted round for a\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n","35":"\n\nplace to get a feed in and, not being able to locate such a thing, we went to one of the stores and bought such provisions as we felt like eating. Tim Woods, Duncan Woolley, Herb Larsen and myself (Walker not being with us on account of his being down with Malaria on the ship,) made our way to the Botanical Gardens, if such they may be called and, on our way thither bought some fruit and repaired - with our guide, a small black fry of about 8, who determined to stick with us for what he thought he should obtain for his labors - into the gardens and had a rest and some eats. We then made back to town. Went to the Post Office, sent some Post Cards home of Freetown, which were the best procurable. We then went through the Native quarter and had a good look round. Had a drink of \"English\" Lemonade at a native shop. We got out into the street again. While there we espied a diminutive nigger boy coming up the street, stark naked, with a pitcher of water on his head. He looked picturesque, but very black. Especially so when Tim Woods opened his camera and got ready to \"shoot\" him for a picture. The kid screamed as if Tim was going to take his life from him. He dropped the pitcher where he held it and made off at the top of his gear, much to the amusement of our boys and the chagrin of many of the native women standing by watchig the inhuman white proceedings. After wandering round until we felt fed up of the place and the heat, we made towards the quay again via the 26\" guage railway station. Had a good look at the station. On reaching the Quay we saw a Military Funeral of an Australian lad from one of the transports. Native soldiers performed all the rites and necessary swank. The coffin was made and supplied by \"the sympathetic undertakers\" of Kissing Street, whose place we had passed previously that afternoon and which bore that noble inscription upon its unpretentious and dilapidated premises. After purchasing more stores of fruit and eats and lining up, we were marched to the barges again and once more embarked. Profiting by this morning's experience of getting into the pack in the centre of the barge, I took good care to get a seat on the side of the barge this time, where I could at least get some air, even if it was hot and hardly breathable. It seemed to be so thick that one could almost chew it. We left the shore for the steamer, about half a mile off, and we traversed the distance in something just under one hour, as far as I could judge. There was not one man who returned to the ship this afternoon who was not glad to be back again and who swore, that should an opportunity present itself, he would not again go ashore at Freetown. The place is run by Missionaries and if the morals the natives demonstrate are those taught by the Missionaries, God help them.\n","36":"\n\nOur Company being on duty no shore leave was given. Engineers were put on fatigues. I did Bakery work which was all I had to do that day.\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n","37":"\n\nSaturday. Our unit supplied the picket on shore for our boat. I was not in it, thank goodness. Did nothing all day except lie about in the shade and look for coolness and have the usual immersion in the afternoon.\n","38":"\n\nSunday. Went to Church service 10.30. Nice service by Padre Forsyth. Ship's complement had to coal the vessel. Engineers had the first go at it. They made a very good showing. Mr Gray and Mr Dumas in it up to their necks. Was not picked, so did not help. Did not feel too good so was rather glad to be out of the dirty job. Day is very hot. Men looked like the niggers when they finished. Took Duncan Woolley's photo while he was smothered in the black coal dust. Norman Walker was discharged from hospital. He is not too well.\n","39":"\n\nMonday. Helped to-day with the coaling operations. Looked like Uncle Tom's brother when I was through and felt as if I had ventured too far into the hot place. Got a bath and was then informed that a Concert Party was to be sent off to the H.M.S. Kent that evening, in which I was numbered, in the quartette. Left ship side at 7.30 in Kent's pinnace and had a delightful spin across the harbor. The party included Dad Rice, Willey, Patis, Wilson, Cameron, Mathieson, 6 stewards, Adjutant and O\/C Troops of our ship. When we got on board the Kent, we saluted the Quarter Deck and were taken by the Padre - an excellent fellow - to the Officers Smoking room and mess and were dealt out and treated in a way that was worthy of the traditions of the British Navy. After getting smoke and booze into us we went on the Quarter Deck and the concert (program for which I sent home), began. The Quartette rendered \"Dear Little Shamrock\" and \"Comrades in Arms\". The program was an excellent one and more cigarettes were put at our disposal. After two or three hours entertainment which were enjoyed by all the tars - judging by the manner in which they cheered us after the conclusion of the concert - we were again treated to drinks and smokes. We then embarked aboard the pinnace once again and set out for \"home\" which we reached at 10.40 and thus ended the most pleasant evening's enjoyment we had so far experienced.\n","40":"\n\nTuesday. Still very hot. Will it never change. Duncan Woolley in hospital with slight concussion of the brain as a result of his fall some weeks back during sports. Concert party from Kent gave us a return visit to-night. Proved to be very enjoyable and clever turns. Sat on hatch for 2½ hours before it began in order to get a good seat and view of the performers and performance. Got program of items. They also showed slides through a lantern. Finale of their bill particularly fine. Gave big cheers as they ended their bill at 10 pm.\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n","41":"\n\nNothing doing to-day. There is still an absence of fresh water for ablution purposes. Have to do all this in salt water which makes one feel very sticky, more especially under tropical conditions. Went to Hospital to see how Duncan Woolley was and stayed with him and yarned. Found him much improved. In the afternoon, Lt. Gray gave us a French lesson. At night we had a visit from the Kent's band which gave the troops a rare musical treat. This place is still as hot as Hades. There seems to be no diminution in these sultry and trying conditions and one only imagines how welcome one of our dear old Sydney's southerlies would be to alleviate the oppression a little, if only for \nan\n one hour.\n","42":"\n\nThe heat is still with us. All on board were hoaxed this afternoon as the ship was observed to be moving forward under her own steam. Turned out to be only a move further into the stream. Freetown has a sandy bottomed harbor with a current that flows at the rate of about eight knots per hour. This move was a result of the ship's change in position and the danger of collision in the case of a heavy blow, which comes to these places, \nat times\n. Called to see Woolley again. He was much better. Had a washing parade. Used rain water out of the ship's boats from the last storm. Events much the same as usual.\n","43":"\n\nStill at Sierra Leone, with the heat and sultriness. All sorts of rumors floating around the ship anent leaving. Wrote article for our Souvenir on our departure from Sydney. Called to see Woolley again. He is still improving.\n","44":"\n\nOur company on duty again to-day. Put on the Guard list. Kept anniversary of engagement in silence, though thoughtful and with a mind full of hopes which are impossible of accomplishment or consummation at this moment and place. Scratch concert on deck at night. Did three turns for the boys.\n","45":"\n\nSunday. Came off guard. Very tired and sleepy. Detailed for church service. Rather annoyed at missing a sleep after guard. Got it over and peeled off to try and keep cool and then had dinner. In afternoon spent the time lying on the deck in the shade. Eat coconuts and oranges. At night the quartette rendered Adeste Fidelis at church meeting on deck. Did not go around the ship singing carols, as was intended, as we all felt too tired from the previous night's guard. Result of Coaling competition was announced. Engineers party won and were awarded the prize of £2.\n","46":"\n\nXmas Day\n. Rose 6 am. Attended R.C. Service on deck to render Adeste Fidelis by quartette, for the mass. Had\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n\nDec 25\n\nbreakfast and then went on deck. Church parades at 10.30. Sang the anthem at services of Church of England and other denominations. Had \"Xmas Dinner.\" Special Menu - Boiled Pork, green peas, yams, fruit, which was supplied by the officers, and sago pudding which looked like a gathering storm, but tasted o.k. Cigarettes were also handed round as a donation from the O.C. Gray. Gave three cheers to O.C. Troops and Captain Jermyn of the \"Marathon.\" Also our own officers. Formed many mental pictures of the folks at home, wondering what part of the world it was in which we were facing grimly the sinister intentions of Hun and Company. H.M.S. Swiftsure arrived this afternoon. She was saluted by our transport in the usual manner and custom according to tradition. The ship's ensign was dipped aft and all the men on deck stood to the salute, as the trumpeter on the Swiftsure blew the call. The ceremony was very impressive and once again drove home to our minds the beauty and severity of the tradition and discipline in the good old British Navy. H.M. King George's message of Xmas Greetings was read the troops this morning at Church Parade. Gave him three hearty cheers for his thoughts. Afternoon. Lay on deck and had a sleep. Evening. Sang Comrades in Arms with Quartette at Sacred Concert which was held on deck.\n","47":"\n\nBoxing Day. Rose as usual early. Had Breakfast and went on parade at 9.30. At 10.30 anchor was weighed and with H.M.S. Kent in the vanguard our vessel and three other ships steamed out of Freetown harbor. At last we were to leave this Hell on earth for something cooler. Steamed into a calm and tranquil sea. Not one wet eye on the ship through leaving the place. Hammock parade in afternoon. Also lecture in First Aid by Sapper Fern. Very interesting. After tea had to get our hammocks out of the bin in the dark. Found the job inconvenient and annoying. Soldiers are not saints when it comes to where they have to get in for their cut of anything. I know that I was not and only thought of rescuing my own little bundle in the general scramble. Had game of Five Hundred with Herb Larsen, McNab and Tim Woods in Sergeants' Mess.\n","48":"\n\nParade as usual. Fine day. Saw tropical sunrise at sea. Very grand and impressive sight. Caught up with strange steamer during morning making the same way as us. She was ordered to fall in with the convoy.\n","49":"\n\nWeather growing much cooler and comfortable. Feeling difference in change of longtitude. Nothing special. Had lectures on points of the war gained since the outbreak, by Lt. Gray. Very entertaining and instructive.\n","50":"\n\nLovely day. Bit on warm side still. Fell in with a big convoy of 6 ships off Dakar, French Sierra Leone.\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n\nDec 29\n\nIt consisted of a French Cruiser, Orotava, Argyllshire, Boonah, Afric, Beltana, which, with us, Marathon, City of Sparta, Borda, Durham Castle and H.M.S. Kent, made up, after much manoeuvring for places, the entire convoy. After 11 am the Orotava turned away again towards Dakar. Had lecture on Engineering points in morning. In afternoon, did some Morse practice. Kent sent party of men off to the Boonah. Evidently some trouble there as the Kent turned right astern and made towards her. £2 won for coaling prize devoted towards defraying cost of the Souvenir which is to be published on our arrival in England. Carried on a vote.\n","51":"\n\nNothing of importance or event this day of our Lord. We are still in the race towards home. Weather decidedly cooler now.\n","52":"\n\nSunday. On guard again. Fifth time. New Year's Eve. Did duty on officers' bar all through without changing position. N.C.O's had concert in Smoke Room in evening and all hands were mole-o. In fact, was not impressed with the way things went at all. There, drunken revels ceased towards 11 pm when I was relieved. Did not want to see the close of 1916. Thoughts are flooding me of home and friends and dear ones away back in dear old Aussie. Went to sleep with a countenance more in sorrow than Jest.\n\n1917\n\n\n","53":"\n\nNew Year's Day. Came off Guard feeling dopy. Slept on deck part of the day, and listened to lecture by Lt. Gray the other part. The fact of being in a new year does not trouble me much, but I am wondering what all are doing at home and wishing I was there with them. Turned in at 6.45 under deck as we were runnning into a big storm and feared rain through the night. Slept well.\n","54":"\n\nRose as usual at 6.30. Rising hour changed to 6.30. on account of shortening of daylight time. Started compilation of Souvenir and made good progress. Walter Willey, Lucas and self commenced to duplicate manuscript accepted for it so far. Accident to engine on starboard side. Fell back in the convoy.\n","55":"\n\nRather chilly in early morn. The days are beginning to grow cold now as we make north. Supposed to be on same parallel as Madeira to-day. Sighted barque on port side making South West from the Baltic. Still at work on Souvenir. Ship's mail closes for Aussie to-day. Sent cards to Jim and others by it promising to write fully on arrival in England. Had submarine warning. Sentry put hole through lifeboat in excitement, through discharging his rifle. Slept on deck. Cold night.\n","56":"\n\nReveille long before daybreak. After breakfast went\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\nJan 4\n\non deck and found poor old Dawn just poking through the dark clouds his welcome face. Cold morning. In fact, the whole of to-day was cold enough for the wearing of a top coat on deck. Did more souvenir work. Weather getting dull again. Had light rain in the evening. Had rehearsal in Smoke room for Saturday's final concert. Wrote letter home at night.\n","57":"\n\nNothing special happened to-day. Weather still cool. Feeling in excellent health. Sleeping below again now as it is too cold on the deck at night.\n","58":"\n\nDid more work on souvenir. It is beginning to assume a business like shape and promises to be quite a success if the printing and arrangement is done well. Nothing out of the ordinary happened to-day.\n","59":"\n\nOur duty day again. On guard. Happened to be the neatest man on parade before the O.C. and was detailed by him for his orderly for that day as a \"penalty\" for my trouble and care with my toilet. Spent the day on the souvenir again and was very glad of the opportunity of so doing. Besides it meant being under the decks out of the cold all day and being able to have a smoke when I felt inclined without having to steal it, as it were. We have run into real winter at last. The sea in the last few hours is beginning to rise and shows signs of a heavy blow with thick weather. Latrine wireless abroad that we are to pick up our destroyer convoy to-night at dusk. Proved to be correct. Just at dusk, as we were all on deck looking ahead of us for a sight which might prove interesting as well as novel. There, sure enough, on the horizon, was a squadron of \"wasps\" signalling with their searchlight morse signalling apparatus, racing towards us so that they might take us in their protecting wings and safely escort us to a haven of safety, free from the menace of vicious Hun submarine attacks. Can feel the barometer falling every hour. About 9 pm we ran into a howling hurricane with wind at anything from 60 to 80 miles\/per hour, I should think, and as cold as ice. Bore it with patience. Got hot tea at 10.30 and 12.45 pm for the Guard and then turned in in the Orderly Room and slept, brokenly, until morning.\n","60":"\n\nCold and wet and blowing like the very devil. In fact, the weather is dreadful. There is not a warm spot on the ship except the stokehold. It proved too rough to dismiss the guard on the deck. Stood on the poop, on the lee side and watched the antics of men trying to walk along the frozen decks between the intervals of the ship's heaving and tossing. Many laughable events took place. No parades to-day as it is too rough. Packed our bags and were ordered to make all necessary preparations for disembarkation early on the morrow at ---. Much joy and jubilation at the thought\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\nJan 8\n\nof our long voyage coming to an end at last. Had several strong windgusts accompanied by sleet which made the decks very dangerous. 6.30 pm. Engines slowed down. Much speculation as to the reason. Recommenced at old speed half an hour later when we were again on our way North. Picked up Eddystone Lght about this time on our Port Bow. Got 40 miles out of our course through the gale, so rumour has it. Missed Huns by a mile or two through coming up with a destroyer which escorted us to Plymouth. Arrived in Plymouth Sound at 11.30 pm., asleep when we arrived there.\n","61":"\n\nRose early and carried blankets for'ard to store. The coldest morning I have ever felt. Tenders, Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake, beautiful craft, came alongside 9 am. Disembarked on Sir Francis Drake at 10 am after carrying packages from A.M.C. to tender. Gave three cheers for Marathon and crew which they returned lustily. Arrived Davenport Station about 11 am. Got busy trucking stuff from pier to a store hard by. Only too glad of a job to make one feel warm. This done, bought and shared sweets and biscuits as this was all we could procure in the way of eats. Got rations all packed up for entraining. Left by L. and S.W. Railway at noon and were soon on our way to our encampment. Plenty of room and the travelling was comfortable. Sat with Walker, Field, Martin, Hetherington, Cockett, Robinson and Steel in our carriage. Arrived Exeter. Handed hot tea and buns. Enjoyed them. Tea lasted (in water bottle) to end of journey. Solomon left behind at Salisbury. Arrived at destination about 10 pm. Made way, per boot to Perham Downs Camp. Arrived in good time and feeling hungry, about 10.30 and, after a lot of shifting about were shown to huts, issued with 9 blankets each and turned in without anything save a cup of \"tea\", after having been without a decent meal since breakfast at 4.30 am. Slept brokenly from midnight. With Walker and was glad to get the chance of a rest, as we all were very tired. Guard left on our baggage at the station at Ainsworth to watch it.\n","62":"\n\nRose 6.30. Breakfast 7. Parade 7.45. Intensely cold. Nearly froze. Ice and frost everywhere. Went for route march of about 3 miles and returned along the beautiful country lanes of old England. This was only an Engineers stunt and was organised by our officers so as to give them an opportunity of wording us about our new conditions and surroundings. Lt. Gray spoke to us about matters in general concerning the Engineers. After a while, we returned to camp for dinner. After dinner we paraded again. Went for another march to get our circulation moving after standing in the cold wind.\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\nJan 10\n\nSolomon arrived in camp. Norman Walker and self got straw and filled our paliases ready for the night's rest and comfort. The thought of sleeping on a straw bed filled us with something akin to excitement. Had tea. After tea, shaved in hut and went to Church of England Recreation room where we wrote letters home. Enclosed pieces of ivy and holly, collected from the roadside on this morning's march. Returned to hut and turned in for the night.\n","63":"\n\nReveille 6.30. Parade 7. Ground covered with snow and just about as cold as it can be. Camp seems very miserable altogether.

Dismissed and ordered to parade again at 11. Ordered on parade at 10. Marched to Parade ground and stood on the snow covered and frozen ground for about two hours waiting for some \"brass hat\" to come and inspect us.

After inspection and a march past, we were dismissed and went to hut for dinner. Glad to get under cover from the ice and mucky ground. Helped Tim Woods all afternoon with medical histories of our company during the voyage across. Had Tea. Also cold bath which chilled me to the marrow.

Oh, these wicked marches. Returned sore footed again. Afternoon, Engineers put on draft for Brightlingsea. Got pay. Spent afternoon in hut wondering what sort of place we are going to.

Breakfasted. Oliver and I walked to Harwich and got my pass fixed up. Spent rest of the day with Olivers and left for Brightlingsea by the 5.4 train, arriving at Brightlingsea at 8.30 pm in time for supper. Thus ended my disembarkation leave, during which I had a most enjoyable and memorable time.\n","130":"\n\nParade 8. First after leave. Nice bright morning. Put on draft for France. Got fitted out and passed through necessary items such as M.I. etc., Lunch. Paraded at 2 in full kit for France. 17 of us not picked for this draft but all my mates are going.

Snow, rain, sleet all the afternoon. Town at 4.45. Tea. Called on Mrs Bateman in evening to bid her good bye. Then went to rehearsal for to-morrow's concert. Had none as it proved a fiasco. Returned to billet at 8 and spent evening reading by fire. No news yet as to next draft leaving.\n","133":"\n\nParade 8. Hall farm again all day.

Rest came a thud, as all my pals, with the exception of two or three, have gone. Feel very down in the mouth at the prospects of being separated from my chums on the other side. Put on fatigues all day at Forresters Hall washing up and cleaning out the place, with its usual once-a-week thoroughness. After tea rang Mrs Linley and then said Au Revoir to the boys who were going away to-night. Had toothache all day and decided to visit Dentist on the morrow. Returned to billet and spent evening, in spite of jawache, reading. Went bed at 9.30 and had very little, if any, sleep all night.\n","140":"\n\nParade 8. Church farm till 10.30 when toothache got too bad to stand. Saw Sgt. Hadley and got his permission and Major Gregson's to go to see the Dentist. Did so and he drew the tooth as being useless. It might have been to him. It had begun to abcess and my face was very sore. I longed for sympathy from somebody, but there was none to be had and, after having a cup of tea at the billet for my lunch, I again set out for the old Church grounds, well guarded against any risk of catching cold in my face. After answering my name at the parade, Sgt Nobes told me to go home. I returned to billet, shaved, washed my mouth out with Peroxide and then crawled into bed and had a sleep. I felt much relieved and better when I awakened. Sat by the fire till tea time. Had tea. Rang up Mrs Linley and returned to billet to spend evening there reading and writing. Feel as well to-night as I did ill this morning. That was d--crook.\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n","141":"\n\nParade 8. Feeling good after physicing and the total absence of toothache. Beautiful morning.

Had tea with Norman Walker and Ken Wardhaugh and then went for mail. Got parcel from Mrs Linley containing Cake, Pork Pie, Cigarettes, sweets etc. and a gold mounted cigarette holder. Dinner.

After taking kit to Rec. Ground returned to billet and stayed there reading till tea time. Tea. Had this in billet from the good things that came from Mrs Linley yesterday. A lovely meal. Stayed at billet all evening. Did some reading and the continuous writing on my pat malone, which is a welcome change to the company of cackling of infamous females who turn the house into a bedlam of slander and back-biting.\n","144":"\n\nParade 8. Cold and dull. Church ground trenches all day. Raining on and off all the time. Very mucky.

Disappointed. Rode round for an hour and them returned home. Went to meet Harold Low to take him to tea at Methodist Church for the concert. Did \"Not Understood\" and \"Man was made to mourn\" from the pulpit, as the concert was of a sacred nature. Spent a very nice evening on the whole and returned to billet at 11 after having spent the evening at Holloway's.\n","149":"\n\nEaster Saturday. Parade 8. Did not go. On leave this time. Hired a Ford Car from Colchester and, with Norman Walker, Harold Low, Noble, Jim McKay, and Willshire, we set out from the village pump station at 8.15. A gorgeous morning for our day out.

Rang them up from station and said good bye at 11.30. Went into waiting room. Left at 2.45 for Folkestone by a special and arrived there at 5.30. Put into billets and slept till 8. Breakfast. Wash etc. Spent morning walking and promenading round and writing in Rec. Rooms. Sat in and enjoyed the sun with Walter, Herb and Walter Willey. Embarked on paddle steamer at Folkestone in afternoon. There seemed to be thousands on her. A packet about the size and design of the old \"Newcastle\" of Sydney. Crossed the Channel amid a cordon of destroyers which extended from Folkestone to Boulogne. Arrived at Boulogne at about 6. Marched from quay to camp at wireless station on \"One Blanket Hill\", so named from the sad fact that the maximum issue of blankets at this hospitable place is one, in which you are supposed to wrap yourself and slumber peacefully and warmly. Twelve men were put into tents and there was not sufficient room left, when all were lain down, to put your wristlet watch without someone lying on it.\n","155":"\n\nLeft Boulogne at 11 for Etaples, by train. A distance of about 11 miles or so which took until 3.30 to cover. Got there without mishap and went into camp and training at the Bull-ring.\n","156":"\n\nChurch parade. Wet all day. Rotten camp life.\n","157":"\n\nMusketry at bull ring.\n","158":"\n\nGas school.\n","159":" 18, 19, 20, 21, 24\n\nStill at Etaples. On cook fatigues and the various other monotonous occupations of a drafting camp.\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n","160":"\n\nAnzac Day. A sort of half hearted holiday, only that one had to do as one was told \nwith\nregarding to the place where one wished to spend it. It was observed by a sports programme held in the Bull Ring and which was widely attended and enjoyed. They reminded one of what the old Olympian Games must have been, for there was many a combat fought on that ground on this Anzac Day between sturdy and stalwart sons of the Empire's far flung colonies and those sons who live nearer the hearth of home. Many of these called for Herculean strength and determination, such a splendid and vast assemblage of physical force and talent was there arrayed. I suppose a finer set of athletic humanity was never assembled before, for this drafting camp at Etaples was the main stream which had to and did feed the British Front in France and Flanders, making up their deficiencies in men and materials a few hours after they were ascertained. Truly a wonderfully organised place with its training grounds, Tommy Sergeants Major, and Hospitals, but a horrid place to be at for the eight or nine days prior to one's introduction to warfare, as we now know it.\n","161":"\n\nLeft Etaples with reinforcements for 15th Field Company of Australian Engineers, somewhere in France. Caught train at Etaples, after having been served with rations in plenty, and set out along our journey, we knew not whither. We might have been going to Berlin, for all we knew. We were stuffed into horse carriages, which were branded \"eight horses or 40 men.\" We did not care as there were plenty of sights to witness as we made our way across the map of France, and the door openings in the horse boxes were much more preferable to the dingy little window openings in the French carriages, as we knew them. We arrived at Albert at 3 and went into the Anzac Drafting Camp for the night. After cleaning up a bit, we got our orders and returned to Albert to see if there was such a thing as a restaurant among its pitiable ruins. It seemed to us to be a mere heap of bricks and told us in advance of what we could expect in the zones more adjacent to the firing line. We spent an hour or so having a look round the town, at the shattered shops, Church with the famous leaning virgin on its shattered tower, of which the French inhabitants held the belief that the day upon which this statue fell the war would cease. We got tired after a while, and after unloading our rations waggon, supplying our own needs in plenty, not only immdeiate but well into the future, we turned in for the night, as we knew that we had a hard day's marching before us in the morning.\n","162":"\n\nFell in about 8.am. Were given orders that we would march to our various companies in charge of certain N.C.O's. Our particular group, together with the reinforcements for the 8th Field Company, set out towards the village that once was Mametz, in the now\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n","163":"\n\nfamous battle field regions of the Somme. After a very hard and fatiguing march, made all the worse by the excessive weight of our packs, consequent upon the additional load they were made to carry in the shape of the rations, with which we provided ourselves yesternight. We felt like unloading the stuff many times on the road, so as to lighten our loads, but we had to learn what a godsend this extra rationing was to us at supper time on many a night after we joined our company. We arrived at Mametz about 2. Detailed to hut, taken on ration strength, company strength, and all the rest of the things that a soldier does when he joins his company, including the sewing on his sleeves of the colors which designate the brigade, company or division, and nature of the regiment to which he is attached. Larsen and I went for a stroll over the fields whereon our Australian soldiers had proved to the world their invincibility as soldiers, but a few weeks before our arrival there. Returned to camp for tea and attended a concert in the YMCA after given by Fifth Divisional Concert Co.\n\nApril 28\n\nAttached to No. 2 section, 15th Field Company, Australian Engineers,","164":" Division, Australian Imperial Forces. Spent most of the day in our hut. Had another stroll around the ruins with Larsen in afternoon.\n","165":"\n\nSpent these days wandering round the neighbourhood of Mametz and doing odd jobs in the camp. This is really a rest camp and as a consequence there is not much work done, just enough to prevent the men from growing stale from their inactivity.\n","166":" 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nTime spent in training, fatigues for Sports and Show, which are to be held on the Recreation Grounds below the camp. \nSports turned out to be a very tame affair. In the morning of the day which these were held, we had our first experience of witnessing a visit of a Fritz plane coming over and being bombarbed by anti-guns. Found it rather thrilling and fascinating.\n","167":"\n\nOn Fatigues at Sports grounds at Pozieres, making tables and benches. Had a terrible head all day. Drove over on a limber which made head worse. Did not have any lunch, not feeling inclined. Set out on return to camp and arrived there at 1.30 damned near dead. Lay down and went to sleep till tea time, when I awakened feeling very much improved.\n","168":"\n\nInspected by O.C. and dismissed for the day. Windy. Spent day in hut and doingodd bits of washing and mending necessary.\n","169":"\n\nWalked out to Delville Wood with Larsen. We were told about this stunt before we went out and the telling made us the more anxious to see the place where all\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\nMay 7\n\nthe Homeric struggles were fought, to decide as to who were the masters of this strategically important region \nand\n dominating position of the Somme fields. A visit to these mangled and sore tried fields and forests, that must have been once so fair and fragrant, was not too reassuring to men who had, as yet, to receive their baptism in modern war's horrid and decimating fire. However, the more we looked on at these things, which were the work of the Hun and those that are his, the more the strength of determination grew within us to go seek the beast in his lair, and do all that lay within us towards his extermination. Returned to Camp after picking up several souvenirs from off the field, with which Herb hopes to be able to make something worthy of the sacrifice which every inch of this country could tell of, could it but speak.\n","170":"\n\nWet day. No parades. Cleaned equipment and stayed in camp all day, writing and lolling about.\n","171":"\n\nParade 7. Marched out of Mametz Camp at 7.15 on the way to Bazentin Circus, near Delville Wood. We entrained there on the Anzac Light Railway for Bapaume. Train ran off the line while we were on our way and, as a consequence, we were considerably delayed. Saw and passed the second Division A.I.F. coming out of the line and, thinking Lambert McKenzie may be with them, went over to see. Had no luck in this direction. Reached Bapaume and detrained. Marched through this much stricken town and on to the Aviation Park to the East of it, where we halted, piled arms, and were dismissed for lunch, of which we were ready and pleased to partake. On the road again at 1.15 bound for Vaulx, a ruined village behind the main Bullecourt positions of the Hindenburg line. Arrived there 4. Camped on the left side of the road, to the rear of the village, in dugouts, in a position that seems to be surrounded by guns and ammunition dumps. Does not savor of safety. This was my really first contact with the grim actuality of war under modern conditions. The barking of our guns seems to give an assurance of safety to one, that is quite absent whenfiring ceases and one hears the boom of the enemy's cannon, the shrill shriek of his shell through the air, and the sickening detonation of its explosion, as it hits, something or some unfortunate piece of humanity, which Fate had put between it and safety. Being tired after \nafter\na hard day's marching, Larsen and I turned in for the night. Had a gas alarm about midnight and were ordered to put our masks on. Did so and then got the \"all clear whistle\", when we were permitted to remove the mask and once more resume the sleep that had been so rudely disturbed.\n","172":"\n\nRose 7. Fritz got busy soon after \ndinner\nbreakfast keeping on all through the day and blazing at the\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\nMay 10\n\nbattery on our left. About 4.15 he started to put shells right into the camp. We were all ordered out of the camp on to the open fields at the back of us. We lost no time in making away from the danger spots. We were at last receiving our baptismal fire. I must say that the experience is anything but nice. But I am not very much afraid. I thought I should be much more nervous of it than I am. A shell landed into a tent of newly arrived Pioneers who were having tea therein. It killed 9 men outright and wounded 8 others. This happened about 25 yards from our dug-outs. Things have grown so hot from a shelling point of view, that our O.C. Major Greenaway, has given orders that we move further up to a more sheltered position ahead of the batteries. We are moved up to an old ruined factory or domicile, it is hard to distinguish which, which gives a better air of protection than did the rat-holes in the ground which were covered with a sheet of iron, which might just as well have been a newspaper, and which we inhabited until just now. The evening was spent quite peacefully, to the accompaniment of the booming of hundreds of guns which were fired incessantly for two or three hours. I was rocked to sleep by the rhythm of their maddening roar, and when they ceased firing about 10 I awakened to wonder at the silence, the awful horror of the silence that seemed to reign in our eerie-like abode. Slept all night on a concrete floor and came through it very well, all things considered.\n","173":"\n\nSpent day in our new quarters awaiting orders amd shaping things to more comfortable conditions, if that is possible. With the incessant detonation of the guns, the old place seems to rock and one is almost afraid that the ruin will fall down around us. Was detailed to help with construction of the kitchen as we are evidently going to remain here for some little time. Sections 1 and 3 ordered to the support line to carry on the work of construction of dugouts. Fritz got busy and put some shells into the A.M.C. Tents and hospital. Heard that his stumt had accounted for 23 casualties. Spent evening writing letters. Turned in early. Artillery opened out with heavy barrage soon after and got up to watch the awe-some spectacle of all these myriad guns despatching their grim messengers of death over to the Hun lines. The noise is indescribable but manage to get to sleep in spite of it.\n","174":"\n\nRose 6.30. Bright day. Sections returned from line. No casualties. Got word that last night's stunt resulted in our side gaining their objective. But at what cost. Got news of Duncan Woolley's death.\n","175":"\n\nRose 6.30. Fine day. Fritz still busy. Worked all day filling in crater at intersection of roads which he was responsible for when evacuating this portion of\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\nMay 13\n\nthe Somme front. Some crater. Managed to get it nearly filled. Returned to billet at 4. Found I had left my gas helmets where I was working. Had to rush back for them as we had received orders to fall in in full pack ready for another march. Got back to billet only to find that the company had started on their way and nobody knew whence there were making. Set out on the road at a quick pace in the hope of catching the company up. Marching in full pack at the pace I was making soon wore me out and I found the company spelling on the side of the road. Got to them just as they began to march again and had to fall in and march along with them. Did the next spell of marching and when the halt came, I felt faint and spent. Luckily, we spelled opposite a canteen where Larsen went and got me a bottle of sodawater which revived me somewhat. Got to a place which proved to be Favrieul, to the left and in front of Bapaume. A most delightful and pretty place, though somewhat battered and knocked about, but a veritable paradise after Valux . Went into a commodious and fairly comfortable billet belonging to the old Chateau where we were away from the continued roar of howitzers and other engines of war.\n","176":"\n\nRose 6.30. Gave blanket in. Marched to Vaulx and proceeded with the work of finishing the filling in of the crater. Saw big aerial fight which was most exciting. Left Vaulx at 3.30 and got wet to the skin coming back in the rain.\n","177":"\n\nRose 6.30. Programme the same as yesterday. Got pay in evening £1\/9\/4.\n","178":"\n\nRose 6.30. Wet.

Did same as yesterday.\n","181":"\n\nRose 6. Breakfast 8. Marched to old billet at Vaulx and got position in cellar. Arrived 9.15. Fritz fairly active again. Marched in open order to the sunken road in reserve positions and did work on dugouts that was started by the other sections a week or so ago.\n","182":"\n\nRose 6. Breakfast. Went to same position as yesterday and worked there all day. Nothing unusual. Fritz quiet. Put some shells close to our billet in the early hours. Returned to billet for night.\n","183":"\n\nRose 7.30. Parade 9.45. Marched to Favrieul again in full pack leaving this horrid and stricken region in our rear, I hope for good. Got wet on our way back.\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\nMay 21\n\nArrived at billet in Favrieul at 10.45 am. Glad to be back there.\n","184":"\n\nRose 7.30. Breakfast 8. Inspection and parade 9. Wet.

Went for ramble with Larsen among the ruins of what was once Bapaume, the capital of Picardy. Saw the beautiful cemetery which was intact. Returned to billet 11.30. Spent rest of day playing cricket on cricket ground, playing No. 1 section. Got beaten sadly. After tea saw football match and turned in early after having had some supper.\n","187":"\n\nRose 7.30. Glorious day. Parade 9. Did apron wire drill in the fields. Very warm. Put some work in on stage for to-night's concert, in afternoon. Concert at 6. Good band music from a Tommy band. Open air affair. Did Gunga Din. Did not expect having to do it. Had made up my mind not to but Larsen gave me away. Fairly well received. Found it hard to work doing items in the open air. Turned in at 10.\n","188":"\n\nRose 7.30. Nice morning. Fritz aeroplane brought down by gunfire at 5. So it is reported. Did not see it but heard the firing. Parade 9. Did wire work in fields.

Did company drill for an hour, then set out for a swim to the pond at Avaloy . Had our swim. Enjoyed it immensely. Much struck with the beauty of this pretty place. Set out for\n \nBouzincourt in charge of Lt Clarke. Led us home a different route to that by which we came with the result that we got lost and about four miles out of our course. Eventually arrived home sick, sore and sorry. Arrived 1.15 dead beat. It seems strange to be in a village that bears no imprint of the savagery of the Hun.\n","212":"\n\nRose 6.30. Dull and thundery.

Reached Ribemont and rested there for lunch. Had nice lunch and then meandered with Herb along the canal banks in the shade of the glorious trees that grow along its banks. Truly a restful sight and one to make light heavy hearts. Fell in again at 2 and resumed our way towards Corbie, whence we arrived about 3 and put into the cleanest and most comfortable billet we have yet experienced. I think the march from Bouzincourt to Corbie is over a route which is, by far, the prettiest and most entrancing that I experienced. I enjoyed every yard of it in spite of the heaviness of the pack and the eternal sweat which makes one's \"bloomin' eyebrows crawl.\" Spent rest of evening in getting cleaned and making our positions in billet comfortable and convenient. Very taken with Corbie's prospects as it as yet bears no imprint of the Hun's devilish destruction.\n","214":"\n\nParade 8. Went to the banks of the Somme River all day for pontoon practice.

Left town for Senlis on dental parade, a distance of about 16 miles, close to Bouzincourt. Went on bike with Red. Had tooth fixed. Arrived there feeling cold and numbed through riding through the cold wind. Had not taken any lunch with us. Dentist took compassion on us and gave orders to his orderly to have some hot cocoa and biscuits prepared for us. Jolly decent of him and we did not forget to acquaint him of our gratitude for his kindness. Set out again on our way back with a head wind all the way, making riding very hard and tiring. Pulled up on the way to pick some cherries that grew on a tree in a paddock off the road a wee bit. Just beginning to enjoy when the old French Madame comes out and starts to roar us up for eating her cherries which she had guarded so well and noisily for the benefit of her pigs. A party of Fritz prisoners working on the road were as highly amused at her exhibition of illustrated speech as were we. After telling her to go to every place except Heaven, in Australian, we leapt the fence and getting on our bikes, resumed our journey towards Corbie. We reached there without further mishap or event worthy of note. Turned in and read, as I felt a bit \"under-done\" after riding so far on a bike, and not being used to it.\n","216":"\n\nRose 6.

He explained that, on account of red tape, or a disinclination so to do, he was unable to dine with me. I took it as an affront on his part and had no desire to eat with him at all. Felt rather disgusted at his behavior. Had tea in a swell cafe and caught train back to Corbie, arriving there 9.30.

Spent rest of cold and damp day on bridging.\n","287":"\n\nStill at heavy bridging. Got pay £1\/9\/4. Did washing on deck after dinner. Jack came over from Arcques.

Caught motor lorry from Sercus to Ypres via Poperinge. Dusty run but much preferable to footing it. Familiar sound of gunfire etc. become new after a good spell away from them. Seems like a lively place. Passed through the dead city of Ypres. Only a shambles with its famous Cloth Hall barely recognisable. Bivouacked behind and to the left of Ypres. Plenty of hostile aircraft about on this sector. Think things portend to the lively side.\n","297":"\n\nParade 8.30. Spent day on dug-outs for our own comfort. Herb, Don Beaton, Snowy and Alex and I spent all day building one to hold 5. It proved very satisfactory and cosy. Nice to be able to lie down on the soft earth again. Feel quite snug and at home in our own little \"'ole\".\n","298":"\n\nWent dental. Spent morning messing around in quite true military fashion. 2 pm. Took motor and went to hospital over near Poperinge. After having tea at 4, caught another motor to Rest station. Slept there all night on a real bed with real blankets and covers.

Had visit from John at 11.30 to tell me he was warned for duty in front line as runner in the coming stunt.\n","305":"\n\nHad day off till 2. Fell in and marched out to Shrapnel Corner. Hell of a place. Desolation and destruction unspeakable. Went out with party to fill in a road crater on the Zillebeke Ridge. Came back and returned to Camp for night. Watched Fritz attack balloons and drive down their occupants in parachutes.\n","306":"\n\nDay off till 5. Had warning for duty. Saw Norman Walker on his way back from the line. Looked very dirty and neglected and wondered if his little wifie would know him as he was that day. Spent most of day helping Herb fix door on dugout. Went out at 5.30 through Hellfire Corner to ridge beyond. Got into a barrage and stayed in trenches for an hour while it lasted. Had an anxious time. Saw balloon come down in flames. Watched our guns open in answer to Fritz barrage. A very awe inspiring and terrific sight. Worked putting elephant iron and sandbags on dressing station until 11.30 and set out for dugout arriving there about 1 am tired and utterly exhausted. Slept as soon as I lay down. Too tired to get something to eat, though starving. Did not awaken until John called at 8.30 next morning.\n","307":"\n\nJohn called and had breakfast with me. He went to his camp later. After lunch, I went over to his camp to see him. Had day off on account of last night's heavy work.\n","308":"\n\nLeft Billets for Zillebeke Lake and line work. Arrived destination 3.30.

After losing way arrived at dugout at 11, tired.\n","309":"\n\nSet out at 9 for Hooge again to load pack mules with dump material. Fritz shelling roads as hard as blazes. Waited an hour or more for lull in shelling. There did not seem to be a safe place anywhere in this dreadful region of destruction and death. Got going about 10.30 and, after loading mules, set out with them to advanced Dump in Glencorse Wood. Took stuff off the poor beasts and set out again for home. Arrived there 2, thoroughly knocked up and shaken. Stripped off and had bath in shell hole with Herb. Felt much refreshed. Spent rest of day in dugout resting. Weather perfect.\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n","310":"\n\nRose 6. Could sleep no longer owing to severe bombardment by our guns which shook the dugout and at intervals, caused the sides to crumble and nearly bury us. Did nothing all morning but sleep. Warned for duty in the line in afternoon. Told we were to go to front line that night as road party to mark out the road in the stunt through Polygon Wood, after first wave had gone over, so that supporting troops would know the track to follow. I was made a picket carrier. Did nothing all afternoon except conjure up possibilities as the outcome of to-night's stunt. Told to fall in at 1.45 a.m. in morning in battle order. Got things ready for the job. Examined Gas masks. Put diary in overcoat in case anything happened to me and asked Tim Woods, in case I should get pipped, to forward it on to John, which he promised to do.\n","311":"\n\nThe day of days. Rose 1.30 and had tea. Fell in 2. Marched out to front line ready for hop over at day-break. Reached there about 4. Guide took us to wrong sector. Went to find our right place. Did not return. We stayed on. Zero hour arrived. Barrage opened 5.45 am. Infantry moved forward. We did not but awaited instructions from Sergt. Forbes. Our gunfire sounded murderous and terrifying. Counter barrage opened soon after. One of the first shells struck and exploded on the parados of our trench killing Faze, Urquhart, McGowen and wounding White, Parker and Scotty Irvine. Some of our party left for aid. Dave Hilton and I decided to stay there and look after and tend the poor wounded. Others left at intervals leaving Dave and I alone with the casualties. We waited in this veritable hell - or worse - until about 10.30. No help came. A party of prisoners came out of the line and I sent Alex Irvine back with them as I could not stand to see him in such a state of nervous collapse. Bill White and Jackie Parker died of their wounds after we had given them all the water we had. Dave Hilton and I decided to stay there no longer as we could serve no purpose by so doing and were only courting danger - or death - by remaining. We were preparing to gather our gear together to start out when - Crash. A shell burst clean in our faces. I went down and remained there I know not how long. When I came to I was smeared in blood and in awful agony. I thought only of death as an end to my pain. Struggled, in my delirium, to get my bayonet out for a sinister purpose and thought of Dave. Called him by name. No answer. Raised my stricken body so as to get my back against the trench side to try and see where Dave was. He lay prone in the bottom of the trench quite dead. This was the finish of me. I started to crawl out on to No Man's land to try and get help and ease from my fearful pain and fell forward on my face exhausted. How long I lay there I know not. I suddenly felt someone roll me over on to my back and say \"what has happened, Noel, old man?\" I looked\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n","312":"\n\nup, with what strength I had left in my poor eyes, and there, bending over me, was Walter Willey.

They stripped me and bandaged me as well as they could and, after putting me in the stretcher, set out with me, with Walter Willey as one of the bearers. I remember nothing more of this day until I awoke in a cot in Liverpool Merchants Hospital, Etaples, feeling very groggy and sorry.

Thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful views obtained from the summit of what proved to be old Roman mounds wherein the ancient conquerors of old England buried their dead. Got back to camp at 5.

Turned in early after returning.\n\n\n\nThe last portion of my diary having become lost, the events from the last date mentioned until my discharge will be faithfully reviewed, but the dates are largely matters of memory and may, in some cases, prove a little incorrect upon verification.\n","457":" -","458":"\n\nFrom","459":" onward until about April 11, the long monotony and tedium of life in an encampment was gone through, with increasing impatience, and a longing for the day to dawn upon which we would march out of this life, on to some Australian-bound vessel that would take us\n\n\n\n1918\n\n\n","460":"\n\nback to the far flung land from which we all sprang. Instinct had told me that the day was not far off and so it had proved to be. For one afternoon, the company to which I was attached at Littlemoor Camp were summoned on parade, told that we were to embark on a nameless vessel on a certain day, and there it rested. We spent our time, in the interim, in packing and re-packing bags, buying little comforts for our long voyage, and making ready in the various ways that soldiers have for the coming change. Then one morning, on parade, we were ordered to proceed to the Orderly Room, where we answered our names to a roll call. The next afternoon, we were paraded there again with our kit bags, and handed labels with which to label ourselves on this coming journey. One almost imagined oneself a leg of mutton, or some such thing, parading round with one's price exhibited upon a most pretentious looking piece of board, with Millitary signs and heirogliphics, which none of us could translate, all over it. However, this was a symbol of movement, if nothing else. About April 11, early in the morning, so early in fact that we were up to beat the daylight to the Railway Station, we were paraded on the road in front of the Camp, and from there marched to the Railway Station at no great distance from the camp. We entrained with the usual Military delay and fuss, and when settled, it was not very long before the train began to set out, with its load of light and homesick hearts for Liverpool, and the transport which was to bear us to our native land, or the land of our adoption, at any rate. We spent the whole of the day in the train, a very cold day outside the railway carriages, as the country for most of the journey was covered with snow; But, with the comfort and modern apparatus on the English trains we felt none of the outside discomfort whatever, for the inside of the carriages were kept as warm as toast by the steam-heating appliance in use. After travelling right across England we eventually arrived at Liverpool Docks at about 5 the same afternoon. Were lined up on the platform, checked and marched on to the transport lying alongside the docks. The Transport proved to be none other than the old Australian White Star Liner \"Suevic.\" The New South Welshmen were stuffed in a troop deck up in the forecastle, and soon settled down to their new life. I applied for leave to sleep in the Hospital wards which was granted, as I found that the stairs were too much for my weakened heart, for the present, at any rate.\n","461":"\n\nWe pulled out from the Docks soon after daylight this morning, and were on our way down the Mersey toward the sea when we came on deck after breakfast. It was a very foggy morning and we could distinguish nothing from the time we rose until the time we left Liverpool a speck in the distance. When the fog cleared we found ourselves at sea, one of a very large convoy,\n\n\n\n1918\n\n\n","462":"\n\nwell-armed, well-protected, and undervery strict naval discipline. Look-out posts were established all over the ship, all guns were manned night and day by their gun crews, to ward off any attempt that might have been made by enemy submarines. It was all futile, for the strong cordon of cruisers and destroyers that surrounded the entire convoy proved too great a barrier, evidently, for anything like this to happen. After two or three days with us, the convoy began to dispel, the cruisers turned back, then the destroyers, and we were then left to the tender mercies of a protected merchant cruiser, which was, no doubt, capable of dealing with any attempt that might have been made by submarines at this distance from England.\n","463":"\n\nAbout this time, the convoy broke up. All ships headed their own direction under their own protection. We were bound we knew not which route, but our ultimate destination we did know. We endeavoured to elicit information as to our route from the Captain of the ship but he would not inform us as to which route we were taking; but, from what he did tell us we were enabled to deduct the fact that we were going home via the Panama Canal.\n","464":"\n\nAfter about three weeks in the Atlantic, we sighted land early one morning, which proved to be Colon, the town at the entrance to the Panama Canal on the Atlantic side. We pulled into the coaling docks here for coal and were granted leave at 1 pm., to go ashore and enjoy the town. We spent a very enjoyable few hours in this place, made several necessary purchases, and returned to ship after having spent the only day on leave that we were to have on the entire voyage.\n","465":"\n\nAt 7 pm we pulled out from the coaling docks and started on our way toward the Gatun Locks at the entrance to the Canal. We were soon within the confines of their huge bulk and the entire ship's human cargo spent the day looking and marvelling at the wonders of this huge undertaking. It was about 5 pm when we passed through the Pedro Miguel Locks which lower the ship to the level of the Pacific Ocean on the other side, and once through these, we slowly made our way down the rest of the Canal toward the Ocean - and Australia - and home. I was glad we did not stay at Panama as it would mean another day's delay in getting home. So we settled down once again to life on the ocean wave and prepared for a month more of sea travelling, ere we were back home again with our ain folk.\n\n\n\nNothing of event transpired from the day we left Panama until\n","466":"\n\nwhen we sighted land once again which proved to be the entrance to Port Phillip, and Melbourne. Sydney men\n\n\n\n1918\n\n\n","467":"\n\nwere rather disgusted with this turn of events, as we felt that as the ship had to pass Sydney almost to get to Melbourne, they might have put her into our own home port first. However, once in Melbourne, we were not long on board. We were sorted out into our various states and entrained on the pier at Williamstown. Once settled, the train soon moved out toward Spencer Street, via Albury, to Sydney and Home, sweet Home. These troop trains were rather a revelation to us. Everything had been studied to the finest degree to make the lot of returning men as comfortable as was possible. We were treated like kings with regard to comforts at the hands of that loveable organisation - the Red Cross Society - and we did nothing but eat, and eat, and eat, right from Melbourne to Albury. There we got out to change trains, and had to eat a big meal which was provided for us by the authorities. After this we entrained again into carriages fitted up in English Hospital Train style, with a real bunk for every man, in which all hands slept and spent a most enjoyable night's rest. Next morning we awoke early and found\n","468":"\n\nourselves moving across New South Wales to the tune of about 50 miles per hour. We soon arrived at Goulburn, where we breakfasted. Entrained again, we set out on the most glorious June morning that ever broke, on the last lap of our last journey towards home. Those of us who were fortunate enough, availed ourselves of the free look-out of the carriage verandah, from which we received many thousands of fond home-coming wavings from kind womanly souls who made one feel that it was good to be home at last. As we raced towards Sydney shrill engine whistles rang out, people cheered, and we were even now running through a continual stream of flags and banners on both sides of the line, the latter bearing such appropriate messages of welcome as prompted the generous heart of he or she who hung it out for us to see and to be glad for. About 10.30 we neared Sydney, and, to the accompaniment of continued shrill locomotive whistlings, women and men cheering, and the many other manners of welcome as only the Australians know, we slowly crawled into the big station at Sydney's Gate, which we all recognised as the Central Station. We were ordered out of the train into waiting motor cars, and here began the most triumphal procession of welcome and thanks from a nation's people, that man ever experienced. What great Caesar and Pompey and Napoleon felt, after returning from their greatest victories, we experienced in no less degree. The welcome was a great deal more than even any of us had ever dreamed it would be. It was colossal and proved too much for most of us. Emotion got the better of us to such an extent that when we arrived at the Buffet in Sydney Domain, to again face those dear ones from whom we had been absent for so long, and for whom we had longed every minute of that lifetime, we were left with no power of speech. And what a meeting that was.\n\n\n\n1918\n\n\n","469":"\n\nAnd what a change had come over most of we men as we stood there being welcomed back on to our native heath by those we loved, those we had fought and bled for, and for those for whom we\nhad\n would have, many did, died for, if necessary. It was hard to realise that the horror of the past had died away from our ears and eyes, if not yet from our minds. It was harder to realise that we were at last home again, with our dear folks, back to civilisation, to life, to love. For was not this the greatest consummation that a soldier can have, being flushed with victory, and, maybe, covered with wounds, which were, after all, only scars of glory. That was the situation as it presented itself to me on that wonderful morning in","470":" Many a time since, on reflection, I have thought the welcome and home coming that we received from Sydney well worthy of all the hardship, sacrifice, pain, trial, suffering, and all else that we endured. It was a fitting reward to all our efforts on the field of battle, a most glorious denouement to the grim drama in which we had all played, if not major, at least minor parts.\n","471":"\n\nFrom the day upon which I returned, the time was spent in the usual manner of attending at Randwick Hospital for Medical Boards, being marked out to such places as George Heights Hospital for sundry treatments, and such like, attending the Barracks for accumulated pay, etc., On August 4, the fourth anniversary of the outbreak of the great war, requiring no further treatment, and having no further leave or furlough to spend, I was instructed to attend at Victoria Barracks for the purpose of receiving my discharge from His Majesty's Australian Imperial Forces. I forget the stipulated hour now, but I attended at that hour, handed in my greatcoat, received my returned soldiers badge and discharge, and made my way home. The lack of ceremony about this discharging of soldiers greatly impressed me at the time. I thought how much nicer it would have been if one of the Brass Hats could have addressed us in tones of thanks from the Commonwealth Government for our services rendered overseas. But that would not have been the Military way. One never gets thanks for anything in the army, and they kept this up to the death, with a vengeance.\n\n\n","472":" with my discharge and badge in my pocket, I made my way home, determined to get out of khaki in record time and into \"civvies\" once again. How nice they felt on one again, and how nice it felt that one was at last free from that ever-present discipline which became inseparable from one's life. So ended my military career as a member of the Australian Imperial Forces, a force that has carven a gilded name on the flint surface of history, a name that is immortal, glorious, a name that is written in the blood of this\n\n1918\n\n\n\n\n\nyoung nation's greatest and best manhood, who answered their country's summons in the hour of need, and went out in the night to face they knew not what, but determined to stand at bay with any force or influence that chose to mar or soil the innocence of their sacred hearth and heath. At what a price? As a living member of that sacred band of Crusaders, I shall regard it as a Heaven-sent privilege,for all time, to have been given the opportunity of serving with, to have once been able to write after my humble name, those glorious letters, emblazoned with success and history, A.I.F.\n\n\n\n"}}
