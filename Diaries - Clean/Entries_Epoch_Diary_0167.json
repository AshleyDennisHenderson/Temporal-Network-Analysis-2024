We passed through numerous villages, & at about 1 PM first heard the firing of the guns.\n\nAt 4.30 we arrived at Albert and detrained.\n\nAlbert, which was once a large & picturesque city is now a mass of ruins. The noted cathederal with the \"Vergin & the Child\" now overhanging the street is like the rest of the city, in ruins.\n\nOnly 8 of us came on to Albert, the others went to the 4th Divn, which is at Armentiers We walked through the town & out to Fricourt Wood about 5 Km. out. \n\nOctober 1916.\n\nThe roads are covered with mud & in places over six inches deep. At Fricourt the 5th Division headquarters are stationed & we stayed there for the night Light rain was falling & we slept in an old German dugout.\n\nThis place a little while ago was the scene of a large battle & everything is now in ruins.\n\n25th After receiving orders from Headquarters we proceeded to the Company which is about 4 Km further at Montauban & arrived there about 1 P.M.

At about 8 o’clock last night Fritz sent over about a dozen shells which landed a few hundred yds\n","97":"\n\naway, but only four of them exploded, & he sent over a few more early this morning, looking for our heavy batteries. I found Pritchard this morning. (He is in No 1 Section & Sam in No 4.) This morning after breakfast he & I went out together to Delville Wood, which is about 2 miles behind the front line. We passed through the once village of Longueval, which is now nothing but a heap of broken bricks & not even the trace of a wall left standing.\n\nSome of our batteries are stationed near it. We found some fine curios in the \"Wood.\"\n","98":"\n\nwhich is now razed to the ground & covered with shell holes, & dead bodies are lying about everywhere. This place was in German hands about 10 days ago & signs of fighting are still fresh. While we were cutting up a German Machine Gun Belt one of Fritz’s shells came across & landed about 30 yds from us, followed closely by two more. We were showered with a heap of mud & after the third one, thought it time to \"git.\"\n\nComing back we passed a great number of batteries who were barking furiously at Fritz, & we arrived home in time for dinner.\n","99":" I have been riding around in one of the pontoon wagons all day. We went to Miminetz Wood R.C. yard & took a lot of material out to Longueval \"dump.\" Although it has been raining \ncontin\n continuously, we have been bombarding Fritz very heavily all day, but very few of his shells have come over our way.\n","100":" I had an easy morning & this afternoon I rode in to Fricourt to the Post Office & Headquarters. Light rain has been falling during the day & the ground is terribly muddy.\n","101":" It is still raining. Fritz sent over a few more shells into \"Death Valley\" about 200 yds from us last night but did practically no damage. (He has been trying to get at our Railhead where the ammunition \"Dump\" is.) I went out to the Mametz Dump on a wagon this morning & out to the Longueval \"dump\" this afternoon. Fritz was shelling it while I was there but did no serious damage.\n\nWe have been giving him a hard peppering this afternoon with our artillery & I saw about 200 rounds fired in 3 minutes from one of our batteries near here. I passed about 200 prisoners on the road this morning.\n\nOctober 1916.\n","102":" I have been on water picquet all day to-day. Water is very scarce here as it has to be carted for miles & consequently is guarded. It has been raining very hard all day & a strong wind has been blowing.\n\n31st Pritchard & myself went out to High Wood this morning. High Wood a few weeks ago was the scene of a very severe battle & many hundreds of lives were lost in its capture. The German lines can be seen from there & he is continually bombarding the place. A lot of shrapnell burst near us but we escaped unharmed. I found a few relics there, including\n","103":"\n\na German bayonet which I intend making into a daggar, \nas\n being too big to carry around as it is. Three \"tanks\" are lying in the Wood, unfit for further service, two of them being destroyed by fire. There were two \"females & one male,\" the difference being that the \"male\" has two six pounder guns as well as machine guns. We had a hail storm early this afternoon & the wind has dropped considerably. 31 observation baloons were up during the afternoon & at one time I counted 82 aeroplanes.\n\nOur artillery has been giving Fritz a very hot time of it to-night, & the 6\" gun near us has been \"barking\" unceasingly. Fritz has sent over very few shells to-night which is rather unusual.\n","104":" The weather has cleared up considerably to-day. This morning I went with the Major to look for a new site for a camp.\n\nThis afternoon one of Fritz’s aeroplanes came over our lines a considerable distance but at a great height.

We were in the vicinity of the support trenches but were handicapped greatly by the mud. Fritz’s artillery was very severe there, but his rifle fire is a mere detail as the artillery of both sides is doing most. Our own artillery was pouring the shells into his lines all day long & our aeroplanes dropped numerous bombs. The mud in the trenches is the worst thing to contend with & it is with difficulty that the men can move about.\n\nThings have been fairly quiet on both sides during the day, but I believe we gave Fritz a bad time yesterday.\n","107":" Heavy rain has been falling all day & we had some light hail this afternoon. We have been carting trench ladders out to Longueville \"dump\" all day & to-night we had to take them down to a dump about a hundred yds. in rear of the \nsupport\n reserve trenches in sledges drawn by two horses.\n\n5th The rain has cleared & at about 9 a.m. the artillery started a heavy barrage on the German trenches. About 10 a.m. there was a general advance. We do not know the full details yet but it is rumoured that we have taken four lines of trenches. The \ncaus\n casualties have been fairly\n","108":" continued\n\nheavy & to-night each company have sent out their sledges to bring in the wounded.\n","109":" We have heard further details of the advance to the effect that we are holding the second line of Fritz’s trenches, but he has attacked it in force & made a break of about 250 yds. & are preparing for a heavy attack. \n\nYesterday I went out with Capt Reid to locate a drain along the railway. We continued with it this morning & this afternoon I went out with three other sappers & took the levels for about 100 chains. We just heard that the Germans bombarded our headquarters at Fricourt on the night of the 4th but did no serious damage.\n","110":" This morning I went out near Longueval to locate & make a rough survey of a proposed railway which is to be made from the present railhead to Longueval dump. We were handicapped considerably by the rain which increased during the afternoon & we had to return. The mud is getting worse around here & it is almost impossible to move about in it. We have been issued with long rubber boots which are a great help, as the ordinary boots are of little use. This afternoon we were served out with cigarettes & tobacco sent to us by the \"Southern Cross Tobacco Fund\" organised by the \"Overseas Club.\"\n","111":" I went out with ten others of the section to start making the light railway near Longueval. Fritz had been sending his shells over since about 11 a.m. & at about 3 P.M. he began to land them close to where we were working. Three landed within 50 yds of us & then one burst right in the middle of the small part we were excivating, making a large hole & wounding three of us, McDonald. Buck & Nesby. Two got \"shell shock\" & two others got slight scratches. A camp about a hundred yds. away suffered fairly badly, but no very serious damage was done.\n","112":" Birthday- I am twenty to-day. We have been on the construction of the light railway line all day, & this afternoon over 200 sets of rails & three trucks were brought up by the ammunition train.

The routine of the camp is as follows:-\n\nReveille 6 am.\n\nBreakfast 6.30 am.\n\nParade 7.15 am\n\nSick Parade 9.30 am\n\nLunch 12 noon\n\nDinner 5 PM.\n\nPiquet Mounts 5.30\n\nNo bugle is sounded, all calls being given by a whistle.\n","139":" I have been off duty all day & at 4 p.m. I went out with a sapper & a party of 10 Infantry men to Rose Trench to continue with the Duck Walk track. We arrived there about 5 & did a couple of hours work using all the available duckboards. Fritz sent over a few shells with occasional schrapnel, near where we were working, but no damage was done. In daylight we would have been under observation but as \nthe\n it is dark about 4.30, we were not handicapped to a great extent. A few rifle bullets wissed around us but shell fire was the worse.\n","140":" To-day I have been doing the same as yesterday, & to-night we laid about 100 yds. of the track. Fritz shelling was fairly quiet there to-night, but during the day he got a direct hit on the track which necesitated it repair.\n","141":" I went out with the same party this afternoon at about 1 o’clock to repair the track on the other side of Ginchy Road. We were on the crest of the hill most of the time but we were not under observation on account of the heavy fog.\n","142":" To-day we did the same as yesterday but were working this side of the Ginchy Road. & returned home about 8 P.M.\n\nAt about five to twelve Fritz landed a high explosive just outside our dugout, not two yds. from where I was sleeping. It burst through the side of the \"dugout,\" which is partly underground, & built of iron cupolas, & wounded 12 of us. There were four stretcher cases & we had to carry them about a mile to the dressing station. The other 8 were \"walking cases\" & were all admitted into hospital. A small piece of shell cut through my\n\n8th continued \n blankets & gave me a slight scratch on the left hand, but I fixed it up with a piece of sticking plaster & have said nothing about it.\n","143":" I have had influenza for the last two days & have been \"off duty\" to-day. I got a slight \"shell shock\" last night & have not been feeling too \"fit.\" Grace got it bad & was sent off to hospital with the others. Fritz has been sending over a few more of his H.Es. to-night & has got some of the pioneers who are about 100 yds. behind us.\n","144":" I went out again to-night with the infantry fatigue & continued with the duck-walks for about another 100 yds.\n\nAt about 8 o’clock Fritz bombarded us pretty heavily with H.Es & Schrapnell & we had to clear out. A party of Pioneers who had passed us a few minutes before caught it rather bad.\n\nIt has been very clear to-day & Fritz has been giving the parties going \"in\" and \"out\" a hot time. There have been a fair number of casualties & he got eight direct hits on the duck walk track during the day\n","145":" I have been out on the same job again to-night & we have got to within 50 yds of the \"sunken road\" which is about 800 yds. from the 2nd supports. Fritz was not bombarding us so hard to-night, but a schrapnell caught one of the party, wounding him in the arm.\n\nTo-day Fritz has been sending over a new shell which is almost silent in coming over & which has a double & very severe explosion \n& very severe\n\nWe have not seen any of them before & it is said to be a new kind he is adopting.\n","146":"\n\n12th This morning we had a light fall of snow. Later in the day it began to rain heavily & the ground has been made terribly slushy We went out again to-night & continued with the duck-walk track.\n","147":" To-day I started with the party on the revetment & drainage of Needle Trench at \"Windmill.\" These are the third line of supports or \"reserves,\" & are always full of men, which handicaps our work to a great extent. We have been shelled fairly hard all day & there have \n","148":"\n\na considerable number of casualties.\n","149":" I have been on the same work in Needle trench since the 13th & have also built a machine-gun position for purpose of defence against aeroplanes which are numerous & at times fly very low. We have been shelled heavily most of the time & have had a fair casualty list.\n\n(Fritz shelling seems to be concentrated on the \"solitary tree\" about a hundred yds in rear of us for the past 4 or 5 days. The duckwalk track which leads past it has suffered a few direct hits.\n","150":"\n\n& it is a risky job mending them. Since the Australians have been on this sector, this place is generally known as Lone Pine.)\n","151":" I am corporal of the guard to-day & had a very narrow squeak about midnight. One of Fritz’s shells landed within two yds. of the guard tent, but luckily no damage was done- not even a piece hit the tent.\n\n19th I am Orderly Corporal today & have had a very quiet day. It has been extremely cold & has been snowing since about 3 P.M. We have had very cold weather for days & the ground has been continually frozen hard. \n","152":" (Continued) We heard to-day that the French a few days ago advanced two miles on a six mile front & captured \nof\n over 8000 prisoners.\n\nTo-day we had to made 50 \"Hop over\" ladders to be taken out to the trenches this afternoon for a raid which anticipated for to-night. We have been taking a few prisoners here lately, two & three a day. They have evidently given themselves up & seem to be very pleased about it.\n\n20th The weather has been extremely cold all day & the ground has been covered with snow & frozen hard. I have been on the construction of the aid station dugouts which\n\nDecember 1916\n\n(20th continued) are not finished yet. Although the air has been very clear all day, Fritzs shelling has been moderately slack around our quarter. The old tree at \"Gunpits\" was \nbeen\n cut down last night & destroyed. It has afforded a great landmark for Fritz & during the day hardly a shell came within \"a hundred yards of that quarter.\" We heard to day that the French have captured over 11,000 prisoners on their last advance.\n\n21st I have been on the same job as yesterday. About 10 a.m. a H.E shell burst about 20 feet away (just behind \"mad\" trench) & wounded me on the left arm but it is not serious.

Before we left camp we were inspected by the C.R.E. Col. Carey\n\nDecember 1916.\n\nwho gave us a shord address & complimented us on the work we had done in decreasing the sick roll of the trenches & making the troops comfortable in the supports & front line.\n\nWe detrained about two miles out of Albert on account of a block in the traffic & mached to our destination at which we arrived about 2 PM after passing through the villages of Darnaycourt and Buir-Seur-Corbie. In Ribemont, our billet is situated in the old post office buildings which is fitted out with bunks, & from all appearances we will be fairly comfortable. \n\nThere are a lot of Australians billited in the village and \n\nDecember 1916 \n","157":" also a fair number of Tommies who are attached to us.\n\nThe civil population here is not very big but we are well off for shops & estaminets.\n\nBeing Christmas Eve we had a fairly merry time under the circumstances & got to bed about 11 P.M.

To-night I & three others went to the vaudeville show about a mile distant from our billet.

The weather has been rather wet for the last two days & fairly cold with heavy frosts.\n","164":" Eve- Sunday is a free day here, & it is the first free Sunday we have had for a long while. We only had one parade at 9 a.m. at which rifles & gas helmets were inspected & after that, the day was our own. The estaminets are open on Sunday & by bedtime the boys were rather merry. There are a great number of Australians in the town & the streets were crowded with them although they were considerably quiet.\n\nThe shops & Estaminets close at 8 P.M. & by 10 o’clock everything was quiet & the majority in bed. We were informed today that leave to Amiens would be granted in a few days.\n","165":" We have had another free day to-day after the first parade, the same as yesterday.

A ration party pushes light trucks from Ginchy Dump down to Needle Dump, & from there they are carried up to the front line. Fritz’s shelling is very quiet in comparison to what it was when we first came here, & some of our guns have moved further up. The 5th Division are \"hopping over\" some time tonight (The 9th 29th & 59th are in the line)\n\nFebuary\n\n25th.

He was driven of & we got a few prisoners.\n\nThe casualties in the front line have been very small lately, but around here, within the last four days, we have had over 80 killed & wounded.\n\n16th Fritz’s shelling has been a bit quieter to-day, but still, he didn’t forget to let us know he was still alive. A great number of our \"plumb puddings\" went down to the line from here this afternoon & it is rumoured there is to be an attack tonight.\n","220":" continued & all the infantry here in reserves are \"Standing to\"\n\n17th. St Patricks Day to-day. Fritz has cleared out! There has not been a shell fired over here all day, & rumours have been running wild. During the afternoon we got the news that the Australians have occupied Bappaume, Boulencourt & a few other small villages & that the 8th & some of the 14th Brigades shared the honours of being first in the villages.\n\nLe Transloy which was captured by the 29th Division (Tommies) & lost a few days later, was also entered by the 14th & some of the 15th Brig\n\n \n","221":" continued At about tea time, battery after battery of 18 pounder guns passed by us & have established positions just in front of us near Rose Trench & the infantry parties going into the line went down in large bodies instead of small parties of half a dozen or so & better cheer was never seen amongst the lads since we have been on this front. To-night is still quiet, but on the horizon towards the enemy, can be seen five enormous fires from the burning villages as left by the Germans. The machine guns seem very active but shell fire is quiet in comparison to what it has been of late.\n","222":" This morning the whole section was taken off their old work, & with our infantry party, we were put onto making a rough roadway to bring the remainder of the guns up, & for \"limber\" & wagons traffic.\n\nThis morning I went over to Les Boeufs & on to Le Transloy & the Sugar Mat to within a few hundred yards of Beulencourt. The latter of these places a few days ago was well behind Fritz’s lines. The country is broken up a lot & in Le Transloy there are signs of many attempts by Fritz to burn the place down.\n\nThere is a rumour at large that we are going to move forward any minute & that we are awaiting orders.\n\nMarch 1917\n\nNewspaper article from March 7, London. Not transcribed.\n","223":" We got orders late last night to be ready for an early move this morning. Our \"tool carts\" came up to Embassy Lane yesterday afternoon, and at 9 A.M. this morning together with them, we moved forward en route for \nBeulencourt\n Beaulecourt, about 6 Kilo’s from Embassy, where we arrived about dinner time. After dinner we set to work putting a road to communicate with the rear, in a state of tempory repair. The village of B.in in a dilapitated condition & we are billeted in the rains wherever shelter can be obtained. Luckily I have got into an old cellar of a ruined house, with six others, & apart from the stuffiness of the place we are rather comfortable & have plenty of room. The country\n\nMarch 1917\n\n19th continued around here is in a far better state than the country we have been in of late. The difference is marked after one leaves Fritz’s late support trenches. The ground between Millers Son & Fritzs third line is literally strewn with dead, & presents a gastly sight- beyond description. Fritz has left a terrible lot of material behind him, but it can be noticed throughout the village & surrounding country, where he has piled the stuff in heaps & attempted to burn it. \n\nThe weather has been bad lately & to-day a strong S.W. wind has been blowing, & at about tea time it started to rain & continued steadily throughout the night.\n","224":" To day the company have been working between Millers Son & the bottom of the ridge (Bappaume Ridge) making a Pack Track for Mules & horses carrying ammunition & rations forward. Our water supply is obtained from a small well in the village (Most of the wells here have been destroyed or poisoned)\n","225":" We had a fall of snow during the night, but it thawed during the morning. Our section started to fill in a large mine crater in the road between here & Bappaume & have made a fair impression on it. The crater was about 50’ across & about 12’ deep & right on the intersection of two roads, but we hope to have traffic through to-morrow.\n","226":" We carried on with the same job this morning with the aid of an infantry fatigue of about 20 (the first fatigue we have been able to get) & also two wagons carting bricks from the village. The hole was filled in & the road is open for traffic. Guns have been coming up ever since we arrived here & an ammunition dump has been started just outside our billet. We had a fairly heavy fall of snow last night & it has continued through the day, & with a strong North wind things have been very cold. I went into Bappaume this afternoon. The town has been smashed about a great deal & Fritz has blown up the main road in three places, making\n\nMarch 1917\n\nenormous craters & shattering all the houses in the vicinity. The railway station has been destroyed together with a large overhead bridge. Bappaume has been a fairly large town & although it is practically in a state of ruin large numbers of troops can be billeted there.\n\nThe water works have been blown up & most of the water poisoned.\n","227":" With a party of infantry I went back to the \"pack track\" near \"Millerson Son\" to repair a part of it. The ground is in a deplorable state, one mass of shell holes & trenches & in places the \"track\" is almost impassable. The Gourdicourt Rd is now open & will probably relieve it of a lot of the traffic.\n","228":" To-day I had 6 A.S.C. \"G.S\" wagons & 8 Artillery \"Limbers\" to bring up a number of \"Armstrong\" huts from near Gourdicourt to D.H.Q. between here & Bappaume, where they are to be errected by the Company.\n\nThe \"Deaucaville\" railway has not yet got up as far as this road (Bappaume Perrone Rd) but the Pioneers & pushing it forward for all they are worth & expect to have it here by to-morrow. The weather has been very cold of late & today the temperature was down to 27.5°.\n\nThe daylight saving scheme started again to-night & the clocks have been put on an hour.\n","229":" The light railway was opened up to-day, the railhead dump being almost opposite our billet.\n\nI had a party of infantry to-day to finish off the mine crater we started on some days ago, & are now covering the surface with bricks brought from \nRinecourt\n Reincourt a few hundred yards away.\n\n26th. I carried on with the same job to-day & have practically finished, & the road is fit for heavy traffic. Last night, at about 11 P.M., the town hall in Bapaume was blown up. H.Q. of one of the 4th. Div. Brigades was situated in the building & it is feared that the loss of life is over 50.\n","230":" (cont) The weather has been very miserable all day, rain, snow & with a bighting cold North wind blowing.\n\n27th. The weather is just the same today. I have had a fatigue party salvaging German material for use in our work. There is abundance of material & ammunition lying about, especially sawn mining sets & barbed wire. The majority of the section & No. 2 are working along the road building huts for D.H.Q.

It is rumoured that there have been four Germans caught in Bappaume, masquerading as French soldiers, & who are aledged to be the cause of the explosions in the last few days. One was killed in attempting to escape. By a few days-old paper we got to-day, it is officially stated that the French are making great progress near St Quentin, & also that the Rebellion in Russia has been settled, the Tzar has been arrested, & the Grand Duke \nNicholas\n Michael is in command. No. 2 section moved off to take up there quarters in Reincourt a few miles away late to-night.\n","232":" This morning I left Beaulencourt about 7.30 according to orders received last night & proceeded to Villers-Au-Flos, a few miles ahead where I met a guide from No.3 Section, who moved over there a couple of days ago, & with him, went around the village to find a suitable place to billet our section (No. 4) I found a suitable place in the shape of an old cellar (nearly all the cellars in the village have been destroyed by Fritz) & the section moved into the village about 10.30 a.m. The day was spent in fixing up the billet & cleaning half a house out of a stable for the horses. I have taken up quarters with Cpl Moore in another, but smaller cellar opposite. \n","233":" Only fifteen of the section arrived yesterday, (the remainder are at \nVaylule\nVelu about 4 \nmiles\n Kilometres further on, and at MillerSon) & seven of us went on with Cpl Moore to clean & make ready for use old wells the advance party have found in Velu. I stopped behind & fixed up the cellar, & also with a couple of sappers, hunted around the village, salvaging material for use by the section in our work. The village is in a dilapidated state & every house is in a mass of ruins. Every well has been destroyed & the fruit trees & many ornamental trees have been cut down by the Germans.\n\nDuring the afternoon the Flying Corps brought up an observation baloon which is to be stationed in a paddock opposite us.\n","234":" Early this morning I was instructed to take a party of seven sappers & L.

The weather has been very dull lately & we have had a good amount of rain during the last two or three days.\n\nThis afternoon, with cpl Murphy, \n","288":"\n\nI went in to Arras, a distance of about 22 Km from here. Arras is a fine large town, (about twice the size of Albert or Bapaume) and although knocked about terribly is still very picturesque. \nshowing signs\n Most of the large buildings have been destroyed, either partially or totaly. The cathederal which has been a magnificent building, has very little left. \nThe\n Part of the tower is still standing & we climbed up to the top of it, about 200’ high, from where we obtained an uninterupted view for about four miles round. The town is full of Tommies, but we saw no Australians. It also has a fairly large population of Civilians for a place so near the lines.\n","289":" We had a route march through Bapaume this morning & were free in the afternoon. We played the tommies football & cricket again this afternoon, as we have been doing for the last three days, otherwise there has been nothing else doing. We have heard nothing further yet about moving off & so far No 3 section has not returned from the supports. The Tommies have been moving up in small parties nearly all day, & a lot have come out. The 60 Btn. is still in the line not having yet been relieved. By yesterday’s paper the news is confirmed that the whole of the Hindenburg line has been captured between Arras & Bullecoart with the exception of about a mile & a quarter.\n","290":" This morning the section went out to Fremicourt where a part of No 3 section have been building a heavy bridge. The bridge is to be constructed over the Nord Canal, (a part of which is still in Fritz’s lines) \n&\n We took it to pieces & stacked it ready to be transported up when the opportunity offers.\n\nThis evening the company held an open air concert in a paddock near by & with the aid of the","291":" Divn Band it proved a great success.\n\nThe good weather still continues & to day has been very warm.\n","292":" Yesterday & to-day we have been doing \"barbed wire entanglements\" in the morning & have had the afternoon off.\n\nWe were playing football & cricket \nin the\n yesterday afternoon & this afternoon the","293":" Division who are relieving us on this sector, gave a concert in the paddock behind the old Chatteau ruins. It was a most brilliant success & we enjoyed it thoroughly. The artists were in \"periot\" costume, & all are members of \nthe\n various units of the Division. The orchestra band of the Div. was in attendance as well as the piano, & they antisipate holding the show every evening free to all comers.\n","294":" This morning we went out to Biefuillers to lay out a line of trenches for the defence of the village in case of emergency. In the evening we went to the concert (\"Verey Lights\") which is still in progress, with a change of programme every night.\n","295":" Yesterday & to-day we were again on the trenches near Biefuillers. The other two sections (No 1 & 2) came with us to-day & considerable progress has been made. No 3 section is on another trench about a mile away. (Biefuillers is about 3 Km from here)\n\nThe good weather still continues, although we has a short but heavy shower yesterday afternoon.\n","296":" We went out to the same job again this morning & returned at midday. In the afternoon I went down with a sapper & made a survey of the trenches for plotting on the map. The concert is still in progress & is well patronised by the Australians & tommies.\n","297":" The section \nwent\n carried on with the same job again this morning, but I remained behind & plotted the new trenches on the Ordinance Survey Map. 57c N.W.3.\n\nThere were sports held in the afternoon with the 8th F.C.A.E. & R.Es. which will be continued to-morrow. At about 6 o’clock we had a heavy shower of rain & the temperature fell soon after.\n","298":" This morning I went on with the drawings again & finished a new map with the trenches marked for the C.R.E. We had the afternoon free, in which we played No 1 section cricket. (This morning the section were out on a short route march.)\n","299":" This morning the whole company fell in on parade in full marching order for inspection, after which we were dismissed & had the rest of the day free.\n\n5th Orders were received to fall in in full marching order again this morning ready for a route march.\n\nThe whole company (including transport & cyclists) moved off at about 9.30 am & returned about 1.30 PM after a \n","300":" route march of about 7 miles. I went out with Lt. Oliver to make a survey of the trenches & barbed wire entanglements between Fremicourt and Biefuillers & returned about 2 P.M. \n\nThe day was very hot with a temperature of about 80°.\n\nThe concert is still in progress but the \"Verey Light\" changed places with \n\n\"The Goods\" for the night. (\"The Goods\" have a show up near Arras somewhere, & were a great success tonight)\n","301":" This morning the company went out on barbed wiring in front of the trenches at Biefuillers & returned at 2 P.M. I remained behind & made out a detail report on the trenches & entanglements of Corps Second Line between Fremicourt & Biefuillers where we\n","302":"\n\nwent yesterday. The fine weather still continues but we had what we would call in Australia a \"Southerly Buster\" at about 5 P.M. (but it came from the West.) Last night some of Fritzs planes came over & \"presented\" us with a few bombs.\n\n7th This morning the company went out for another route march with full packs & transport. It was for a distance of about seven miles & when we returned to camp a \"bathing parade\" was held at Bapaume.\n","303":" The big bombardment up north started last night & it is expected that a big push on that end of the line is about to take place.\n","304":" Sports were held at Bancourt this afternoon by the Divisional Engineers & Sig. Coy. It proved a magnificent success & the 15th company came off very well. I was in the tug-o’-war team, which came out first after beating the 14th F. Coy.\n\nThe weather which has been gloriously fine of late, changed to-day & light rain fell during the afternoon although it did not last long. The heavy bombardment up north between Ypres and Armentiers still continues, and news has come through that the German salient there which he has held so long has been forced and our line straightened with heavy losses for Fritz.\n","305":" This morning the company went out to Biefuillers to complete the wire entanglements around the trenches & returned at midday. In the afternoon we played the R.E’s of the 20th Divn cricket & beat them.\n","306":" We had an exceedingly heavy thunder storm last night & it has been \nrail\n raining all the morning, but during the afternoon it cleared up.\n","307":" This morning I went out to make a survey of some new trenches which the 59th Battn. have been digging & finished about 2 o’clock this afternoon I rode out to near Velu on the motor bike & returned through Boulencourt.\n","308":" To-day I plotted out the new trenches on the map & made out a report on them for the C.R.E. The remainder of the section went out to the trenches near Biefuillers to put up an extra entanglement in in front of one of Fritzs old trenches in order to make it defensible.\n","309":" The company were engaged on pontoon instruction all the morning, & had the afternoon off. The 14th Field Coy. played our company rugby after tea on a paddock at the back of our billet, in which the 14th won by a try. That makes them 1 point ahead of us for the sports \"Cup.\"\n","310":" The company were on pontooning again this morning & had the afternoon off as usual.\n\nHard luck came my way to-day- I had left some photos at Contay when I was there to be developed by a photographer \nthere\n but most unfortunately the M.P.s got to know of it, with the result that they were sent on to H.Qs who now demand an inquiry into the matter. This look a serious affair, seeing that cameras are forbidden in France, & may probably mean a court martial for me. \nThe\n I am now awaiting developments, & a report has been sent to C.R.E.\n","311":" We were warned to-day to be ready to move to-morrow & all preparations are being made. The 2nd Division \nare\n is relieving us here for some time & the majority of the infantry have arrived & settled down.\n\n17th Final preparations were made this morning for a shift and the advance guard of the 7th Field Coy arrived here to take over from us about 10 A.M. Before leaving I went over to the 18th Battalion & found Charlie Kay a brother of Kit, who came over from Australia a short time ago, after returning from Galipoli. At about 1 P.M. we \"fell in\" on parade with \"full\n\nJune 1917\n\nmarching order\" & moved off for Bapaume where we entrained together with the 5th Div. Pioneers & left about 20.30 P.M. passing through Ashliet-le-Grand & eventually detrained at Varennes. From there we marched to Bouzencourt, a distance of about 10 Kms, & were allotted to our billets in the town & settled down for a while.\n\nBouzencourt is not a very large village & has two or three of the 5th Div. Infantry Battalions billeted there as well as us. Our pontoons & transport arrived here a short time before us & are parked in a big paddock on the outskirts of the village.\n","312":"\n\nWe paraded this morning in \"fatigue dress\" & marched to Aveloy, a small village about 6 Kms away, where we all had a swim, which was very welcome & well appreciated. A large lagoon on the side of the River Anore affords a very suitable swimming basin & has been improved for that purpose by some of the lads who were in this section before us. During the afternoon we had some fairly heavy rain which lasted all night.\n\n19th Although still raining slightly we had our usual parade, & as the rain cleared during the morning had some \n\nJune 1917\n\ncompany drill. Orders were given out late this afternoon to the effect that we are to make another move in the morning bound for Corbie.\n\n20th We paraded this morning in \"full marching order\" with our transport & moved off in full swing at about 9 AM, passing through Senlis, Henencourt, & Brestle, & arrived at Ribumont about noon where we halted for about an hour & a half & had lunch. Moving off at about 1.30 pm. we passed through Mericourt & leaving Heley & Bonnay on our right, arrived at the town of Corbie at about\n\nJune 1917\n\nhalf past three, after marching a distance of about 20 Kms.\n\nAt Corbie we were met by guides of the advance guard who took us to billets & I have been allotted with ten others to a Frenchmans house in Rue de la Boulangerie, which appears to be very comfortable.\n\nLast night a fire broke out in a large Champagne store in the town & our lads, (the advance guard) were called out to help extinguish it. The result was very evident & champagne, & good stuff too, was exceedingly plentiful, being of course \"buckshee\" of which the lads freely partook. The \nother\n three companies of Engineers\n\n8th, 14th & 15th arrived in the town to-day & we are the first Australian troope ever billited in Corbie. It is a large & thickly populated place, & from all appearances promices to afford us a very good time.\n\n21st This morning we paraded in \"drill order\" & marched down the river (Somme river) to a spot about 3 Km. from our billets where we are to go through a course of Pontoon Bridging. Our pontoons came with us & we started work straight away. During the day we transported all our gear to the other side of the \n\nJune 1917 \n\nstream where it was parked & later in the day received two other pontoons & superstructure from Bray sent down by the Divisional pontoon Park.\n\n22nd We carried on with our pontooning again to-day & four more pontoons arrived. The other two companies are working further up along the river above the lock & we have picked a very suitable spot.\n\nJune 1917 \n\n27th \nWhe\n We have made excelent progress with our pontooning since we came & can now form a bridge in record time. The 8th & 14th companies have brought their gear down the river & have parked just below us. A large lagoon just at the back of us affords extra scope for bridging & is being used by them more than the river. We have been making great efforts for this day & this morning we paraded in \"battle order\" for inspection. The whole of the Engineers formed up in fine style on the river bank with all the transport\n\nJune 1917\n\n& at about 10.30 AM General Hobbs, G.O.C. 5th Div. arrived, attended by his A.D.C. & Staff Col. Wagstaff. He inspected us in a body, and afterwards, the 8th & 14th formed two bridges in double time, across the lagoon. As soon as they were complete the","313":" doubled across & formed two bridges across the main river, one of 5 bags was completed in 6 min. 10 sec. The whole transport moved across the bridges & formed up on the off side of the stream, where the General congratulated us on our bearing & work, with which he was very well pleased.\n","314":" This morning we went down to the river again although very little work was done.\n\nRowing was more in prominence than anything else & I have started to pick a crew of 10 to pull in the regatta which is to be held here shortly. During the evening we had some rain, but it did not last long.\n","315":" The same thing was done to-day as yesterday, & I am making considerable progress with the training of the team. A four oar team has also been picked.\n","316":" We had a heavy shower of rain during the night, & the place is very sloppy as a result, but although the weather has been dull all day, the rain kept off, & we were able to make final preparations for the Regatta.\n\nAll the pontoons & superstructure of the three companies, was removed from our old position, further up stream to about half a mile above the Lock. A suitable place for the sports has been decided upon & we made a start to prepare the place. A large lagoon adjoins the canal, & the swimming & diving part of the programme is to take place in there.\n","317":" This morning we went down to the canal & put things in order for starting this afternoon. A bridge has been put across the \"lagoon\" also a large landing stage & a sort of a \"Grandstand\" made of the pontoons, which already presents an interesting aspect.\n\nAt 3 P.M. a preliminary start was made with the sports by the rowing. The course of 800 yards has been marked out on the canal, & the","318":" Coy won a victory over the 14th Field Co. in the 10 oar \"galley\" race. With the four oar crew, (\n I\n myself as cockswain) we scored a victory over the 8th by about 4 inches, & the 14th beat the H.Q. Crew by a length.\n\nJuly 1917\n\n3rd The big day of the Regatta. The finishing touches were put to the decorations etc, & everything looks \"tip top\" The sports opened up at 2 P.M. with \nthe\n our Officers 4 oar, winning a victory over the 8th Field Coy. The company 4 oar was next & my crew got an easy victory over the 14th. The 10 oar \"galley\" race was run at about 3 P.M. between the 8th & us. Both teams were in the pink of condition, & the race was a good one. We kept fairly even until within 200 yards of the finish, when I shot out with my team & beat the 8th by over half a length.\n\nThe \"staff\" was well represented \nat the\n among the audience and \n\nJuly 1917\n\nincluded Major General McKay ?, Brig. Gen. Elliott (\"Pompie\") & a Lieut. General as well as representatives of the Imperial army. We also had visitors from the 1st & 2nd Div. Engineers & the 8th Brigade Band was in attendance. Swimming & various other water sports were a great success, & the 15th came out rather successful in that, (we got 1st & 3rd in the High diving. I had a team of 4 in a pontoon, pulling a tug-o’-war against teams of the 8th & 14th Coys. & won the final.\n\nAltogether the afternoon was a glorious success & an enormous crowd of French spectators were present. The 15th have won 27 first prize medals out of 50, & numerous second & thirds.\n\nJuly 1917\n\n4th Last night we had a very heavy rain storm, but excepting for a shower this morning the day was fairly fine. We are all very tired after yesterday’s turnout & did not feel much inclined for work. We went down to the canal this morning & after a lecture on venereal disease by a Colonel of the 1st Div. A.M.C. at which Captain (Archdeacon) Ward & General Hobbs were present, we started to dismantle the structures we had made for the sports. Gen. Hobbs was not present yesterday having had to attend the funeral of Gen Holmes (late of Rabaul etc) who was killed whilst showing Mr. Holman around the trenches.\n","319":" This morning the company went down to the canal just above the lock & made a start to form a heavy bridge, calculated to carry 20 tons. (12\" X 12\" timber & 12\" R S Joists being used with 3 three part pontoons as a pier.) At dinner time I was warned for guard & had the afternoon off until 6 o’clock, when I mounted the Quarter Guard with three men.\n\n6th I was on guard all day to-day & was relieved by the 8th Field Coy at 6. P.M.\n\n7th The Company were on the canal again this morning & we formed another type\n","320":"\n\nof heavy bridge calculated to carry 12 tons with safety.\n\nIn the afternoon we \nhad\n played \na holiday\n the 14th F.C. football (Australian Rules) but unfortunately lost. At about 1 PM to-day the 5th Div. Pioneer Battalion came into Corbie & took up their billets here, probably in order to take a course in Pontoon bridging, which I understand, General Hobbs has advised Very heavy rain fell during the night accompanied by heavy thunder & lightning.\n\n8th Sunday After the 9 o’clock parade this morning we were free for the rest of the day. I had a glorious feed of cherries this afternoon.\n\nJuly 1917 \n\nfrom a tree next door, the old lady having invited another chap & myself to have some. \n\nIt has been raining all the morning but cleared up after dinner.\n\n9th This morning the section went down to the lock & sorted out a lot more of the gear for pontooning. Some of it is to be taken further down stream together with material for the pile driving which we will be doing in a few days.\n","321":" Nos 3 & 4 section went for a route march this morning for about 5 Km along the river towards Perone. In the afternoon the whole Coy. was photographed by the French photographer in the town.\n","322":" The baths were open for the company this morning & those who were not on duty went down, but unfortunately there was no change of underclothing to be had. This afternoon I had to go & see the mayor of the town, for purpose to getting permission to fell about a dozen trees by the canal for piles.\n\nLater I went around with the \"Forrest Guardian\" & marked the timber I wanted. A concert was held by the Div. Engrs. in the \"Tivoli\" to-night with great success. Medals were presented for the Bancourt Sports held some time ago.\n\n12th I had eight men to cut down & trim the trees ready for piles to-day, & got about seven ready I also had three horses, & as soon as a log was cut, had it drawn to the river’s edge to be\n","323":" continued prepared for driving. The remainder of the section were making ready the \"pile driver\" & we hope to make a start to-morrow. The cyclists of the \nsection\n Company went to Heinencourt this morning to attend the review at which the King was present.\n\nVarious Battalion or Unit competitions were held in the presence of the King, & were a great success, & proved a credit to the Australian troops.\n\n13th This morning, final preparations were made by the section for the pile driving. The 8th Coy have already started & have a considerable number of piles driven. Owing to an accident\n","324":" we were only able to drive one pile this afternoon & got it a depth of 14 feet in the \"mud.\" (With a half ton monkey, & a drop of 4’, the average drive each strike was about 3 ½ \") This afternoon an order came through from Corps Head Quarters, to the effect that my case conserning the camera, was to be dealt with by the Company.\n\nIt is most fortunate for me that this has happened & I have escaped with a \"reprimand,\" due to the efforts put forward on my behalf, by Major Greenway my O.C. Yesterday he was asked for recommendations for the officers school to be held in England during the next three months, & owing to this most unfortunate \n\nJuly 1917\n\n13th indiscretion on my part is was deemed best that I should not go, although I had been \"booked\" for it for some time & the Div. Regimental S.M. went in my place. This would, in all probabilities have meant a spell of 5 to 6 months in Blighty for me.\n","325":" This morning Nos 2 & 4 sections went for a route march along the canal as far as ------------ a village about 5 Km from here & returned by a circuitous route doing in all about 10 miles. We had the afternoon off & most of us went for a swim in the canal.\n","326":" Last night & early this morning we had a very heavy fall of rain but it cleared up about 10 a.m. & was fine for the rest of the day. Our section were down on the canal again this morning with the \"Pioneers,\" instructing them in Bridging, & again this afternoon.\n\n17th This morning we went to the same old place & formed a \"medium Bridge.\" At about 10 a.m., the whole of the 8th Brigade arrived from Senlis & after marching over the bridge together with all the transport formed up \n\nJuly 1917\n\non the other bank. During the afternoon they were brought into the town & billited.\n\n18th To-day the 8th Brigade left Corbie & the 14th came in arriving about 11 a.m. & went through the same procedure as the 8th.\n\n19th The 14th left this morning early & the","327":" Brig. arrived at about 1.30 P.M. General Hobbs & his staff were here each day to see the brigades arrive & pass over the bridges. Everything went well & each night we took out the three centre \"bays\" of the \n","328":"\n\nbridges to allow traffic to pass through, & we also had to \"break\" on an average of 3 times a day.\n\n20th I went to Senlis this morning to have my teeth attended to, & will probably be staying a couple of days.\n\nThe \"Divisional Train\" arrived in Corbie this morning & passed through the same procedure as the three brigades. General Birdwood also, was here to-day, but was unable to attend the inspection on the previous days.\n\n21st I am at Senlis now in the 8th Field Hospital & the dentist has made a start on my teeth\n\nWe had very heavy rain during the afternoon\n\nJuly 1917\n\n22nd I have got my teeth fixed up but only temporily, & returned to Corbie by train this afternoon.

The weather still continues fine & most of the \n","356":"\n\ncrops around here have been taken in. Fritz made another areal raid to-night & bombed Aire & Hazebrouck. They were soon driven off however by the anti-aircraft guns & very few bombs were dropped on the towns.\n","357":" This morning we marched to Blaringham & were inspected by Gens Birdwood, Hobbs, & \"Pompie\" Elliott. The whole of the 15th Brigade \"marched past\" & we returned at lunch time. In the afternoon we were doing squad drill. Capt Caddy has gone on leave & Lt. Oliver is acting Transport officer. A large areal raid was carried out by Fritz to-night on Aire & a few bombs dropped very near to us.\n","358":" Drilling all day-(squad & musketry drill) We had another raid from Fritz to-night and a few bombs were dropped near Aire.\n","359":" We did another route march this morning for about 12 miles. It has been raining practically all day & the ground is getting very sloppy.\n","360":" Squad-drill all day- Rain has ceased & the weather is very fine.\n","361":" We had a 6 mile route march this morning and drill in the afternoon.\n","362":" We had a bath this morning in the new divisional baths near Blaringhem, & in the afternoon, instruction on \"Strong Points\"\n","363":" Company Drill this morning & the afternoon off.\n","364":" We had a 27 Kilometres route- march this morning & had the afternoon off. About 11 a.m., it began to rain & continued through the afternoon, clearing up about 8 P.M.\n","365":" It is raining again to-day & a very cold wind is blowing. In the morning & again in the afternoon we had a lecture on demolitions.\n","366":" We left Morbecque at about 10 A.M. with the tools carts, en route for Aire about 10 Kms. away, where we arrived soon after 12 o’clock. We are down for a course of instruction in Heavy Bridging under R.E. instructors, and are living in three large barges on the river (Lys).\n","367":" which are fitted out with bunks & very comfortable.\n","368":" We started work yesterday & to-day have almost compleded a 60’ Inglis Tubular Bridge which we began this morning.\n\nThe company has been divided into 8 parts, which have been lettered from A to H (I have got G)\n","369":" We finished the Inglis Bridge this morning & started on a heavy girder bridge. Fritz raided the town early to-night but was driven off without doing any damage, by the anti-aircraft guns.\n","370":" One of our men went to Bethune & got into the hands of the military police last night.\n","371":"\n\nI had to go in and bring him home this afternoon. Bethune is about 28 Kilometres away & slightly damaged by Fritz.\n","372":" We left Aire soon after dinner to-day & arrived back at our old billit in the farm about 3 o’clock. The late Adjutant, Lt Evans came back to the company a few days ago as transport officer and Capt. Caddy after returning from leave took his place.\n","373":" - Company drill this morning & the afternoon off. We have done very little since we came back from Aire and are antisipating a move in a few days. The weather is still fine, with a warm sun.\n","374":" This morning the transport of the company left Morbecque, together with our blankets. In all probabilities we we leave to-morrow.\n","375":" We left at 10.30 A.M. in motor lorries. 10 were allotted to the company & each section had two lorries, \"H.Q\" had one & the officers the other. We passed through Hazebrook and crossed the Belgian border at about 11.30 & continued on through Poperinge & Dickiebush.\n\nAt about 2 P.M. we arrived at \"Cafe Belge\" about 3 Km from Ypres and 4 miles from the front line.\n\nThe artillery is all around this area, and very thick. After dinner we set to work \nand\n to bivouac for the night, as no accomodation can be found. Transport arrived about 5 P.M.\n","376":" All through the night the firing was very heavy & a good number of Fritzs shells landed very close to us. The aeroplanes were also very active during the night. The whole company have been working on \ntheir du\n making dugouts, during the day, & have succeeded in obtaining a little better shelter than we had last night.\n","377":" This morning Lt. Oliver and I started on a reconnoisance of the sector. We did the light-railway-tracks, support duckwalk tracks, \n&\n mule tracks, & new roads. Their positions were marked on a map, & also suitable positions for proposed roads to the trenches. The whole of this sector is literally swarmed with \n","378":"\n\nguns of all calibre and new ones are continually coming into position. Many of the guns have been placed in their gunpits ready for action with an abundant supply of ammunition, but are as yet without gun’s-crews (they are coming up later)\n\n14th We continued with our reconoisance this morning & had a narrow escape at \"Hell-Fire Corner.\" We did the tracks & communications to \"Jargon\" trench (present front line) on the left of the sector & also position of \"dumps.\" The 17th, 18th, 19th, & 20th London Country regiments are represented in this part of the line & are anxiously awaiting our chaps to relieve them. The remainder of the company are building \"Nissen-bow\" huts about a mile further up the road.\n","379":" We were on the same job again this morning & did all the communications to front line, & the whole of the front line & outposts on the sector we are to occupy. At 9.AM our artillery began a barrage on Fritz & kept it up for half an hour, fairly heavy. We had got up to within 300 yds of the front line, when Fritz retaliate with a barrage & we found ourselves in the midst of it. Although it only lasted half an hour it seemed ages & it was a miracle how we escaped.\n\nHe kept up a steady shelling on the front line & supports throughout the remainder of the day & we had a good many casualties. The front line is in a very bad state & in places not more than a couple of feet deep. The 7th Londons are also\n\n15th Continued in the line & during the afternoon the \"Yorks & Derbys\" relieved them.\n\nAt 4 o’clock they had a \"hop-over\" an took some of Fritz’s line in order to straighten our line in the centre.\n\n16th We finished the reconoisance yesterday & to-day I have been with the remainder of the section on building the huts. They have made great progress & have a fatigue party from the Tommie’s Labour Battalion.\n\nDuring the morning 15 German aeroplanes came over & in the afternoon we were shelled with shrapnell.\n\nThe first Divn. were moving up to-day & the 6th Batn. took up quarters in the huts we have completed. They had about 20 casualties during the afternoon & night but none killed.\n\nSeptember 1917\n\n16 Continued Lt. Clarke met with an accident to-night & was taken away to hospital. I went over & saw Charlie Kay (18th Batn.) who has been up on this front three days.\n\n17th We are still working on the huts & have finished 18. The 6th Batn moved out & the 8th London Reg. came in, on their way out of the line & are staying for the night.\n\n18th We continued with the huts to-day & the 5th Batn took over the huts when the \"Londons\" left. Fritz was giving us a fair amount of Shrapnel during the day but his range was a little over estimated & very few casualties were caused. Early this morning \nall\n our artillery gave Fritz an hours barrage. Over twenty prisoners passed us to-day. (Every day there have been on an average of 10 passed us on there way to the \"cage\")\n\nSeptember 1917\n\n19th There has been a fairly heavy bombardment going on at intervals during the day & to-night as well as last night. This afternoon I took the C.R.E. (Col. Carey) down to the supports & showed him around the country, & returned through Ypres. All the 1st & 2nd Divisions have come up & have taken over from the Tommies. We are expecting a \"hop-over\" early in the morning.\n\n20th The heavy bombardment started early this morning (about 1 AM) & continued during the whole day, increasing & subsiding alternately.\n\nThe lads \"hopped-over\" this morning at daylight & the Tommies on our right & left at about the same time, on a front of 14 miles.\n\nLarge batches of prisoners have been passing us all day & I have seen over a thousand of them, many\n","380":" continued being badly wounded. (There have been a lot of British wounded passing too)\n\nAt 8 PM the results of the Australian sector are as follows:- Have taken & advanced 500 yards past the 3rd objective & are still fighting, have advanced in all over 2500 yards past \"Clapham Junction,\"(our old front line), have taken over 2000 prisoners 73 guns, many \"trench-mortas\" & machine guns, & have had comparatively small casualties\n\nThree counter-attacks have been launched by the Germans, but each time he has been repulsed, with heavy losses. The Tommies on our right have advanced about a mile. Lt Oliver & I have been down & pegged out a light railway over the trenches to be constructed as the advance proceeds.\n\nFritz is shelling heavily at intervals & the observation baloons & heavy guns have already begun to move forward.\n\nSeptember 1917\n\n21st No 3 Sectn. have gone up to Ypres on road construction & No 3 are working in shifts near Hooge. The others are continuing with the \"Bow\" huts on which we will be for a considerable time in all probabilities. No further news has been received regarding yesterday’s stunt & the infantry are now consolidating the new line under the charge of the 1st & 2nd div. Engrs, ready for another \"hop-over\" Fritz counter-attacked to-night after a heavy bombardment which was retaliated by our own artillery, but we do not know the results yet. At dusk to-night one of Fritzs planes came over above the clouds & dived onto one of our ballons, setting it alight with his machine gun. At about 10 P.M. another of his planes came over, but the search-lights found him & before he had time to get back, the gunners brought him down in flames.\n\nSeptember 1917\n\n22nd The section have been working on the huts again to-day, & I am on picquet to-night, on the material for for them. The 14th Brigade moved into the line to-night & the 15th Brig. have moved into the huts. They are going up to-morrow.\n\n23rd After lunch No 2 & 4 sections moved up to Zillebeke Lake in \"battle- order with blankets. We are quartered in small \"dug outs\" on the bank of the lake, together with some of the","381":" &","382":" Brig. infantry. At 8 P.M., with a 49th Btn. fatigue party the section moved up to Glencourse Wood (captured a few days ago) & made a \"mule-track\" over the ridge. At about 2 AM. Fritz put gas over & some heavy shelling followed, but we had no casualties & returned at 4 A.M.\n","383":" Returned back to the Lake at 4 A.M. & slept until dinner-time. At 7 P.M. with two sappers I went down to Hooge to inspect & repair General (\"Pompie\") Elliott’s dugout. Deep dugouts are very few on this front & are almost a failure on account of the wet ground & pumps have to be continually used to keep the water out.\n\n25th We returned \"home\" at 3 A.M. after encountering a barrage from Fritz on the way. Fritz has been shelling fairly heavily all day & especially around the lake. At 4 P.M. we were warned to \"stand by in Battle-order\" ready to move at 5 minutes notice.\n\n26th Nos 1, 2, & 3 sections left at midnight for the front line & No 4 are awaiting orders to follow if necessary. A tremendous \"drum-fire\" barrage began at daybreak & continued\n","384":"\n\nnearly all through the day. Fritz began to counter-barrage about half an hour before us & he also kept it up throughout the day, with Glencourse Wood as its centre. The Division (5th) \"hopped over\" at daybreak & took their objective (about 1000 yds) The 3 sections followed the infantry over, & finished their job. Both Engrs & Inf. had received heavy casualties, but not nearly so great as the enemy\n\nThe","385":" Brigade had lost all their officers & Pritchard took charge, \"dug in\" & consolidated the position. Over 2000 prisoners were taken & many machine-guns & trench mortas.\n\nThe casualties of the company up to 8 P.M. are as follows:- 9 killed, 14 wounded, 5 missing.\n\nThis afternoon I went out to find Lt Pritchard & brought him back. About 8 P.M. I took a party with a \"Norton\" Tube-well up to Hooge. No 4 section went out about 10 P.M. to the front line & \"wired\" (barb-wire) in front of the front line trench & returned home about 6 A.M. (no casualties)\n","386":" Heavy barrage began at daylight & continued for two hours. Returned home 6 A.M. & slept all the morning. This afternoon I took the \"tube\" well to BlackWatch corner (Pollygon Wood & drove it in, but the supply of water is very limited. From 4 to 6 P.M. we were in the midst of a heavy barrage from Fritz & I was half burried twice before we got into a \"Pill-box.\" Fritz counter attacked but was driven off with heavy losses. The 3 of us were nearly sniped by machine guns but by 8 o’clock everything was fairly quiet. After our reconoisance for a water supply we returned home at 6 A.M. (for","387":" see further on)\n\n29th At 9 A.M. I went out again with 7 sappers to establish an advanced water supply & dug a well inside a \"Pill-box\" about 1000 yards behind the front line to a depth of 15’ & struck water. Fritz has been shelling heavily all day & at 8 P.M. he put a heavy barrage over & counter-attacked on the front & both flanks of the salient. Our barrage of both artillery & machine guns opened\n","388":"\n\nup & stopped him, & I believe, not a man of them got back alive. We advanced a couple of hundred yards, took prisoners & a great number of machine guns. The wire that the section put out last night & the night before had a lot to do with stopping his counter-attack. We finished work at 2 AM. & returned home. Fritz has been bombing heavily all\n","389":" Returned home 4 AM to Cafe Belge. The section left Zillebeke Lake yesterday afternoon. The Tommie Engrs have taken over from us & are moving into this camp to-morrow. We are very tired after our spell but have had a very easy day. To-night Fritzs planes came over & dropped a few bombs very near our camp but we had no casualties. Our casualties in the stunt are as follows 10 killed 2 missing 20 wounded Lt Turner & Sgt Elliott are missing.\n\n(28th I went out this afternoon with 2 sappers to test a well I found near Glencourse Wood & also continue the reconoisance. We returned home at midnight.)\n\n"}}
