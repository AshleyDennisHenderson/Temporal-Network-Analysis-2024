If O’Codaghan Neil boring Coy came here, BOres would surely yield fresh water – instead ours is all brought by the trawlers - ¾ gallon per man for everything – \n\"packed\" up by Thursday Powers that be are not very practicable when it comes to Barb Wire fencing for entanglements, water etc:-\n\nBlackbirds, Thrushes, an odd Robin & a little crested grey bird, which imitates a cat at night time, are becoming more plentiful along the trenches. \n\nTwo dead cats have been seen in our trenches probably from the Farms near Anafarta.\n\n1915","321":"\n\nI mentioned our Jam Tin Kerosene Lamp similar in appearance to our Jam Tin Bombs. Some Egyptian laborers on the Beach, found a Bomb & thinking it was a lamp lit it!!! The result was a big mess, & the rest are more careful – these laborers are Greeks, Gypsies, etc & we are not too keen on them as Spies are found at times & after Greece \"selling us a Pup\" over this place we are not over in love with them at present. I am very happy Mother at being back again & all is well so worry not – I stand the cold a great deal better than ever I expected to be able to do.\n","322":"\n\nI remember thinking a man was living a hum drum existence on the station but Riverina except in the middle of February perhaps is a Paradise to Egypt & what a clean living country Australia is compared to these parts!! Certainly this cannot be called Humdrum, but it is a bit monotonous being so cramped up. Digging is the chief occupation by Day & watching by night.\n\nI have just been ironed a pair of Pants (Slacks) like all soldiers clothes a rotten fit why is it that Pyjamas in the Hospitals & so on are \ncut\n in such Comic fashion – However the Pants are clean & as we sleep & live in clothes a change is good.\n","323":"\n\nThe Hospital Boats always look so comfortable & close, we can hear the hours being rung on the Bells while on \nour\n Beats and in comparison to our darkness on shore\n\nThey show up brilliantly – green lights with a big Red X amidships. This morning 4 Battleships & 2 Monitors bombarded one night, with Salvoes which made the hills tremble I guess Johnny Turk must have had some casualties poor beggars but what about the Armenians – fortnight to Xmas Day!!! I note you & Day are sending Billies, which we all trust will arrive especially as we are on half rations.\n\n \n","324":"\n\nDid not go to Church as tonight I shall be up all night putting out \"Chevaux \" barb wire entanglements – in front of trenches. Nice to handle in the dark & as soon as the Turks hear a noise they play their Machine guns & all hands have to throw themselves flat on the ground. Am taking over No.2 subsection tomorrow another line of trenches in the same post.F. to morse signal nothing I could give interesting news as to developments here which you will know in Australia long ere these notes reach you – Tis sad to contemplate\n\n1915","325":"\n\nOne man got a scratch last night but we got up about 150 yards of Barb wire – At some points the Turks have thrown out grappling irons & dragged the Barb wire in, at one post they sent back a message rolled around a stone that \"15ft lengths would be easier to handle\"\n\nSome humourists evidently – I could tell you much to interest you tonight but I dare not – However its a 1000 to 1 we will not spend our Xmas Dinner on the Peninsular. No more Mails outwards or inwards for the present.\n","326":"\n\nFortunately the weather is remaining fairly fine. We are in the hands of the Almighty for the next of it. Keeps calm all will be well. Abdul has given us his worst number of and Bombs. But a surprise is in store for him. Our next Dugout is not so roomy as the last. I have Lieut Harris in with me. A little more vermin I think also but the cold settles these friends – Fancy a warm bath clean sheets again!!! Got a rotten cold. Turks let go 7 pigeons today – news for Constantinople no doubt.\n\n1915","327":"\n\nSome of the men who were putting brought back ‘Chestnuts\" – I missed them in my Dug out & found this morning when I went to put on my sheepskin waistcoat that the mice had hidden the Chestnuts in it but left \nall the bad ones\n in another corner of Dugout and yet the bad ones were not broken. How did they know! Today the Turks hung a dummy man over their parapet & it was not until a good many shots were fired that we took a Tumble. \n","328":"\n\nNearly two months since I returned to Anzac & still a case of \"As you were\" – However this state of things is nearly finished now. Blew up the stranded ship at end of Pier today. My Batman has tried hard to catch a fish. Bombing them is now forbidden but this explosion killed a few.\n\nGoodnight Mother dear, keep well till I come home - \n\n1915","329":"\n\nStill calm thank the Almighty – you will understand why, the cables will have told you long ere this – I am trying to obey the spirit of our orders & tell you nothing but you can read between the lines. \n","330":"\n\nAnniversary of leaving Camp Holdsworthy: who could have fOreseen all that has happened since. It is hard to be violently interested in the small happenings of life, when on a stint of the present magnitude – I am pushed up on a Hill & if I live through the next 48 hours will have something to tell you I cannot write now. \n\nCuth Fetherstonhaugh\n is to be with me in this position – so I am in good company – can you read this scribble \"ars longa vita brevis\" As some of my Squadron leave first I send this \n\nLove to you all. \n\n1915 Sunday December 19\n\nAs we evacuate the Peninsular tonight I may as well say so & if Johnny Turk gets me I have sent my Diary by an officer to post who went last night – a jumble of notes written in odd places of our life here – \n\nI am one of the very last to leave this we consider a compliment – All my kit has gone, so if taken prisoner it will be cold – but we intend giving Abdul a good go for it – first – The boys are writing fare well messages to the Turks some are very amusing but there is a very sad side of the question which we all feel as we pass the graves of our mates. Tis true Tis pity & pity tis tis true – Fleas bad\n","331":"\n\n1.30 AM\n\nIn two hours I should be off the Peninsula, with the rear guard the Garrison have all gone wearing \nsoks\n on their boots for silence – Time drags 1000’s Turks are in front watching us, but they are puzzled at our silence – a few shells on the beach & Machine guns that is all – so far – I scribble this in the signal dugout – on board SS Prince \n\n 4 A\n\nWe were the last to leave & had a good run, I have only what I stand up in – 1 p.m. Transhipped to a larger boat the SS Elelle where we will be drafted & landed at different camps at mudros – for a few days.\n\nNow I am going for a hot bath then a sleep.\n\n1915","332":"\n\nIt will be a treat to get clothes not salt water washed woollen soks etc never seem to dry – A hot bath - !!! etc. mudros - \nthen shipped to S.S. Elelle\n raining hard & a big sea – was not the Almighty kind to keep the elements in control!! till we got away! Sea rough Disembarked 4 p.m. with & Marched 3 miles to East – ruddy cold & rough choppy sea. Just discovered I left my Sovereign belt with X6\/-\/- in bathroom on the Boat – No blankets tonight, but too tired to bother – Relief the strain of watching the Turk is over & I think to shift \n20,000\n men and guns in 2 nights without the enemy knowing is good work.\n\n4\n\n Hospital \n\n22 December Wednesday 6\n\nHear we are off to Egypt in a day or two to join our Horses – as you see below over 10 bags Mail here – came so 2 Australians came from Mother - Letters from Percy Smith May – Walter Campbell – Embarked at 2 p.m. on the Ioman for Egypt – wet muddy & tired but with a feeling of thankfulness at being alive – now if we can dodge the submarines we are right, for a while. The Boat is crammed with troops \nX & unfortunately there is a good deal of feeling between the English & Colonial officers – certainly we have many Scrubbers, but among the Tommy officers are many snobs and nincompopes – the real man is easily picked out. Sounds small etc.\n \n\n1915 Thursday December 23\n\nGot a bad cold no matter soon OK again as we sail South to a warmer clime –\n\nLeft outer Harbour of Lemnos at midnight, convoyed by Battleships & Torpedoe boat destroyers – 11 Hospital Boats including the Acquittania were in the Harbour.\n\nThis boat is a big Atlantic Liner belonging to Allen Line & had taken troops to Salonika –\n\nBy wireless we hear that the Constantinople report is that we are driven into the Sea of Anzac. We are to hold on to Helles & winter there. Am detailed as Capt. of the day - \n","333":"\n\nA good many would be thinking of the homeland today & you will be thinking of us – I did not expect to be in such comfort I can assure you –\n\nI was amused at \nMother’s\n label on my papers, \"\nSee that these are delivered\"\n, certainly it seemed effective as they were the first I had received. Sun came out for a few hours today & the sea is calm again.\n\nWe miss the big shells & Mauser bullets, & the smell of the corpses in No-man’s land in front always strongest at dawn –\n\nBut the Chloride of Lime is still with us in the troop decks now mixed with steamer smells.\n\n1915 Saturday December 25\n\npeace on earth – Goodwill towards men!!! What a farce\n\nI have not said much about the Navy but it was under their guns we left Anzac they acted as our Sponsors \n\nThose of us who have lived in our clothes in the past 2 months are pretty ragged, compared to the Units who have no been further than Lemnos & are rather looked down on by the Brilliantined superiors. Had reinforcements come early & the British Nation listened to old Lord Roberts warning, we would have had men for Serbia & the Dardenelles. We intended having a Concert last night but the Skipper would not allow light – as we are in the danger zone of Subs.\n\n26 December Sunday 1915\n\nI am afraid my notes must be difficult to read & in future will endeavour to write more clearly – \n\nAnd so we return to Egypt –\n\nYou remember the saying \"Having once tasted the waters of the Nile one is bound to return to Egypt\" I hope the same may apply to the old Murrambidgee – I love the Gum trees but the Palms & the Nile & the Desert have undoubtedly a charm. Arrived Alexandria noon Bright sunshine blue sea & all’s well – The next move I expect will be Cairo –\n\nTransports Hospital Boats & Warships all following each other.\n\nArrived safely Aerodrome camp 5 p.m. Monday\n\n1916 Monday December 27\n\nWonder will the man able to control our destinies - 11 AM for Cairo \n\nSo many letters have arrived I can hardly acknowledge.
