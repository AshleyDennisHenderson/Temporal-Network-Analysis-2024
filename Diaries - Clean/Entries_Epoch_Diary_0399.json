Tom wounded in wrist binding up trench so he made me No1 & I dumped my rifle & took his revolver. After being stuck up about an hour we advanced but I could not keep up with my load & gradually got left behind & kept falling over in mud with fatigue. Fritz started heavily shelling\n\nabout where I fell over last so I got into a shell hole with couple others & from this point everything is a blank to me & I think I got shell shock. I know shells were falling almost on edge of shell hole but still had not felt any fear or been nervy up to this point. That concussion of a shell outed me for a time anyhow everything was a blank till I came to my senses fairly close to Ypres near a lake & some naval guns – had walked \n\nseveral miles. Had also lost all my equipment & the Lewis Gun & revolver. I then looked around for our camp as too fatigued to go back to the line then, & then walked 3 or 4 miles pretty well all around Ypres trying to find it. I struck some Victorians from 60th Btn & they gave me a good feed of stew & bread & jam as was famished with hunger & cold & wet through with rain having lost overcoat waterproofs everything.

An Aussie who came with me to this place from Weymouth told me he was told to out to Forth Bge as Grand\n\nFleet was there. It must have been the Grand Fleet I saw on Tuesday when going up. There were dozens of British & American warships anchored from Rosyth right down below the ridge.\n\nContinued in new diary.\n\n"}}
