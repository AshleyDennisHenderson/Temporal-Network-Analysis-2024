Went up to Poziers about midday. Fritz was very quiet until about 6 pm Some Canadian troops took over from our fellows up in the line. The Australians are leaving the Poziers front. There is a brigade of Canadians here. After being humbugged about a good bit by some of the Canadian Officers we shifted from Poziers to another dug-out about ½ mile away. Had a busy night. Owing to the sap being very muddy we carried along the parapet, which was a big risk as the snipers were very busy with the machine guns, bullets were whizzing every minute.

We are billited in an old barn & by jove it is a very lousy place too, but nothing compared to the trenches.\n\n7 Thursday\nA very nice day, it is quite a change \nafter\n to have a whole sunshiney day, after the very changeable weather of the trenches. I don't think I mentioned about the flies out on the field, they are absolutely in droves of millions, but there is one good thing they don't seem to pest the life out of you like the domestic fly, they either go for the dead or the meat in the cook house. Sleeping & cleaning up all day. Things are very quiet here.\n","207":"\nThe people down in the South of the western front seem to be very reserved.

We are still in ear range of the firing, but I don't know the distance to the line. Left Longvillette about 8.30. arrived at Douleons about 10 entrained & left Douleons at 12.30 am –\n","208":"\nSlept during the whole journey arrived at Poperinghe (Belgium about 7 am. We then marched to Reninghelst, where we waited all day in a vacant allotment for our billets The people here seem to be a far better lot than down on the Somme district, more obliging. We are about 6 miles from Ypres & about 8 miles from the firing line. Harvesting is in full swing here. Went into our billets about 4 pm.\n","209":"\nThe Belgium language is \nvery\n much like the German in some instances. A very fine day. A very big fog in the morning. Went for a walk round the town in the evening. Very quiet all day.\n","210":"\nYesterday the Colonel held a general parade & complemented us on our work on the Somme Front, he also presented a sergeant with the military cross & mentioned 2 others being mentioned in despatches. Today was a very fine day, although a shower of rain in the afternoon. On duty all day repairing, weeding & cleaning drains. Saw Bill Freeman & went round the town with him. The people are very obliging here.\n","211":"\nRather a cloudy day, rained a couple of times during the day. Didn't have anything to do all day. We can hear the firing of the big guns quite plain here. We are billeted in small huts (thatched roofs). Apparently the Canadians were here along time, as they had beds in all the huts, I was fortunate enough to get one, there are about 22 of us in the one hut; they are very comfortable. Saw Billy Collyer around the town in the afternoon he is in the 4th D.A.C.\n\n13 Wednesday\nWe get up about 8 am, have breakfast 8 am dinner 12.30 pm & tea 5 pm, we very seldom have any parades. Detailed with a squad putting up a hospital tent, it didn't take us very long to put it up. Sewed 4th division colours on my tunic. We are not getting very good food here, I believe we got better in the line. There are a good few hotels in Reninghelst. The Belgian people seem to drink a terrible lot of beer. The","212":" division's colours are chockolate circles, we don't wear brigade colour.\n","213":"\nA very cold morning, the coldest I have experienced for a very long while, well in fact it was very cold all day. I had a tooth pulled out in the morning, now my gum is rather sore, it was a very long tooth & took a good while to pull it. A & B sections went for a route march in the afternoon, on account of my tooth I didn't go. Rained all the evening, mud is everywhere.\n","214":"\nDetailed to stand by for fatigue but none cropped up & we hadn't anything to do all day bar read a couple of papers. We get fatigues every other day. C section took over the divisional baths last Tuesday. It is a lovely day today after the rain. The 4th Fld Ambulance played the 12th field, football in the afternoon which resulted in a draw, each scoring 5 points. Went for a walk round the town in the evening with Billy Freeman.\n","215":"\nThings were very quiet during the morning, did nothing but read. The days are very cloudy & cold now. General parade held at 2 pm & the latest style of gas helmet issued. They are entirely different to previous issues & it only takes 6 seconds to adjust them ready for a gas alarm. Fell in 6.45 pm & went by motor to Dickebusch (about 5 mls We went through the gas at Reninghelst to test our new gas helmets.\n","216":"\nWe are now about 2000 yds behind the firing line, in the advanced dressing station. Things seem to be very quiet here a gas picket of 13 men has to be kept here, so as to give the alarm of gas.\n","217":"\nThe town of Dickebusch is fairly large but is in ruins now through shell fire. We are about 300 yds out of the town. I got the job as clerk in the dressing station, it is a very easy job, we only had three patients all day. I have to enter down all their details including their wound or disease, & again enter them when they are going out; It rained continuously all day.\n","218":"\nWe are on the right hand side of the salient here. Things seem to be rather quiet, as we hear very little firing. We never get any shells over this far. There are plenty of rats here, some are a tremendous size as large as a fair size cat. We were a bit rushed this morning, with sic parade, but it was very quiet during the afternoon. Very cloudy & rainy weather.\n","219":"\nStill very wet. I have four blankets now & 2 overcoats so you can guess I don't like getting up early of a morning (we have to get up at 8 am) There was a German Major brought in this afternoon he was shot through the leg & also had another wound, he seemed cheerful after we gave him a feed, but couldn't speak English. It was pay day here but as I had some money left, I didnt draw any.\n","220":"\nWe play cards, dice & read to pass our time away. Everything is still very quiet. Saw a couple of thrilling air raids by our airman this evening, my word there are some very brave men in the flying corps. Nearly all of us went rat hunting in the evening but only accounted for two. We used ascenteline gas to blow them out of their holes, but they were too quick for us.\n","221":"\nNothing doing all day, bar a bit of a sick parade & a couple of sick fellows who were to go to hospital, we have a couple of these fellows everyday, most of them suffering from influenza, I suppose the change of the climate is responsible for this. A German Airoplane flew over Dickebusch & dropped a few bombs but only added more destruction to the houses.\n","222":"\nWe have visits nearly every day by German airoplanes, but they are soon beaten back by our own guns & airoplanes, there was supposed to have been one brought down by our antiair craft guns yesterday. It is a beautiful day today. I wasn't feeling to well though.\n","223":"\nIt takes me all my time to keep the chats under, there are plenty here & whats more they breed very quickly.\n","224":"\nWe only had two wounded patients today, the first since we had the wounded German major. Preparations were made for a stunt which was supposed to come off during the night, but nothing happened. Every thing was exceptionally quiet during the evening. A beautiful day. I wrote seven letters during the day & sent 3 handerchiefs to my sisters & one to my mother.\n","225":"\nA fellow couldn't wish for better weather than we are getting here now, although it gets rather cold of a night time. There are 5 big 12\" guns being placed round here, one was fixed up this afternoon & fired 8 shots, the sound nearly deafens a person, you can see the shell of this gun if you look intently, when it is fired. One of our airoplanes was brought down this morning, & the Pilot died of wounds this afternoon, he was only 16 years old.\n","226":"\nThere are two anti-aircraft guns about two hundred yards away & we are practically surrounded by 18 pounders up to 12 inch guns. They make a terrible row when they all start. Pte Whiting gave me 3 francs (2\/6) to do his shift on gas picket, I was on from 12.30 am till 3.30 am 28\/th. I read nearly all the time, that is when the rats kept quiet.\n","227":"\nI don't think I mentioned that the 4th field Amb has been cut up to fill the different posts about, most of the squads are in dressing stations as there isn't much stretcher bearing to be done up here. Another one of the 12\" guns was firing this evening with the 60 pounders. All firing together they make some noise.\n","228":"\nhad rather a large sick parade this morning. Dug a bag full of potatoes up. They are rather large & good spuds. There are a good few fellows digging them so I don't suppose they will last long. There are very large mosquitoes here, they are absolutely the largest I have seen, but they don't seem to trouble you like the small ones.\n","229":"\nFreddy Ryan's squad (bar me) went up to Spoilbank this morning, & Len Burnett's squad came down here. There was rather a big bombardment on over Ypres way about 9.30 pm. All timepieces have to be put back an hour at midnight tonight on account of the daylight saving\n","230":"\nThis last couple of days Fritz has been putting shells very close to our quarters, otherwise everything has been very quiet.\n","231":"\n\nRaining all day. Done gas guard from 12.30 am till 3.30 pm, very monotonous. Great machine gun activity heard during the early morning. As there seems to be a scarcity of candles we have to manufacture a few fat lamps (made by putting fat & a wick in \nthe jam\n a tin. I am still looking out for some mail. I wrote to Lilly Beck so I can expect a letter in a few days.\n","232":"\nThe Germans occasionally bombard the village of Dickebusch, but only add more destruction to the damaged houses etc. I suppose at one time or another every structure has had a shell through it. Cpt Bently exchanged places with Cpt Phillips, & Pte Le Clerc went with Cpt Bently. The Big 12\" Howitza gun nearest here was removed during the very early hours of this morning.\n","233":"\nDone gas picket from 3.30 am till 6.30 am nothing startling occurred. The artillary about here has been very quiet this last few days. Still very wet, looks as if it has set in. Very big bombs are used by the enemy on this front, thrown by trench mortars, they are known as rum jars by our fellows on account I suppose of being similar, there is absolutely no hope for any one who happens to be caught by one, they account for more deaths than wounded.\n","234":"\nOwing to a couple of arguments about work here, I threw over the job in the dressing station as I was expected to work outside as well. Went on gas picket from 9.30 pm till 12.30 am. Received 7 letters 2 from Doris, 3 from Olive Turner, 1 from Ellie Bennetts & 1 from Mrs Blackwood, this is the first mail I received since","235":" I can expect a few more letters also papers which Mrs B has sent.\n\n6 Friday\nOur principal pastime here is ratting, but I am afraid the rats know too much for us, because we never succeed in catching very many. We had about twenty minutes gas helmet drill this afternoon the shortest time was six seconds. I very seldom go down in the dressing station now, for since the argument I had I only work about outside.\n","236":"\nIt still keeps on raining, although it is a beautiful moonlight night. Filled a cart with bricks in in afternoon. We get the bricks from the damaged houses about (some of them are only a heap of broken bricks) but we run the risk of the Belgian Police, who if they catch us tries & makes the military pay for what we take they are red hot.\n","237":"\nDone gas picket from 12.30 am till 3.30 am. Since we have \nthe\n a stove set in we have Scones, Tarts, Pies etc, we have a fair cook.\n","238":"\nWord was received this morning that the G.O.C. & a couple more heads were going to visit here, but they never turned up, so we had all our extra cleaning up for nix. Went into Reninghelst on the back of Pte Beauchamps (Despatch rider) motor bike, had a real good bath at the divisional bath, bought a few things & walked out to Ouderdom, talking to Le Clerk & came back to Dickebusch by the horse Waggon.\n","239":"\nDone gas picket from 12.30 am till 3.30 am I done the middle shift on account of Fred Moore wanting to go to Reninghelst early in the morning. Owing to the water we have here being pronounced \"not fit for human consumption\" we have to carry water about a mile. It is a beautiful moonlight night. Went out to Voormezeele in the ambulance wagon to have a look about.\n","240":"\neverything out here is in heaps of ruins. Saw the place where the Canadian was supposed to have been crucified, & the Nunnery where the nuns were maltreated by the Germans. Voormezele is about 800 yds behind the firing line. Things have been very quiet for the last couple of days, bar a naval bombardment, we can just hear it here. We received the news here this evening that \nfour\n three of us have to go to Bedford House & one to Ouderdom. Received a letter from Mrs Nelson.\n","241":"\nReceived a letter from Lilly Beck & one from O. Turner. We went to Ouderdom during the morning by red cross motor cars. Done gas picket from 3.30 am till 6.30 am, very monotonous. We left Ouderdom about 7 pm for Bedford house, passing through Ypres, which now in places is nothing but heaps of ruins, while in other places it has been blown down to the ground. Ypres has been a very large city. We arrived at Bedford House about 9 pm & took over from the 2nd Field Amb. Rather heavy bombardment on.\n","242":"\nBedford House is just outside Ypres, It consists of three houses (which have all been battered about by shells etc) surrounded by a moat. Baron Rosenthal (a German spy used to own & live here, he was shot in the Tower of London). The place here is overrun with rats which through the want of food are very poor. Last night we were very busy with stretcher cases until about midnight, but tonight we only had one case & a few sick fellows.\n","243":"\nWe are right in the middle of the salient here & the carry down to here is about a mile, but we are only about 800 yds from the closest point from which the Germans send over a good few machine gun bullets, it is dangerous to walk about on the north side of the house after dark. Did nothing during the night. Very big bombardment on at intervals during the night, there are guns all round of us, & the sound is deafening.\n","244":"\nThis morning Fritz is putting a good few shells very close to us, he is trying to locate the battery that was firing last night, but they went away early this morning.\n","245":"\nToday was a beautiful day although rather sharp wind blowing. It is very dangerous to strike matches or show a light of any kind outside of a night, if a machine gun isn't played onto the place where the light was, it is a cert that a few shells will come over, so a person can't be too careful. The airoplanes observing for our artillary causes a lot of annoyance to Fritz, he fires hundreds of shells at them trying to bring them down.\n","246":"\nWe are\n it is fairly quiet here now, so we havent much to do. We have to carry our drinking water from King Alberts \"Chateaux\" a distance of about 400 yards. Only the walls of the chateaux remain standing. Went for a walk to Ypres in the afternoon & had a good look round. It has been a fairly large city, but now \nin places\n is in heaps of ruins & in places battered to the ground.\n","247":"\nSeems very peculiar it always starts to rain about 7 pm every evening & continues throughout the night. It makes the boards very slippery for us to carry on. We generally have about six stretcher cases & about the same amount of walking cases every night. There are a good few 18 pdr guns around us, & when there is a bombardment on, the noise is terrible, you cannot hear yourself talk.\n","248":"\nThe rumors we have been hearing this last couple of days about us being relieved, came true today. The 4th London Field Ambulance took over from us during the afternoon, & we went to Ouderdom by the Ambulance cars about 7 pm. It rained very heavy nearly all day & the water is running through the roof of our dug out & is about 8 inches deep in places.\n","249":"\nIt was bitterly cold this morning & has been cold all day. There was a bit\nof a frost this morning, the first I have seen for a very long time. I received 9 letters today including three from home. This makes 24 letters I have received this last week. Went into Reninghelst during the evening & had a good time. Sent some Xmas cards away to Australia.\n","250":"\nissued with gloves, inner soles for boots, & undervest (winter clothing) This evening I went to a send off tendered to Major Welsh of C section of this Fld Amb. It was a very good turn out & had quite an enjoyable time. There was plenty to eat drink & smoke. The evening was concluded with speeches, recitations & songs which were very good\n","251":"\nstill keeping very cold. Done up parcel for home & got it censored by Cpl Furber. I think we will be shifting from here in a couple of days.\n","252":"\nThere is some talk of us going back to the Somme Front again, I hope it isn't true anyhow. Marched from Ouderdom to Reninhhelst about 7 pm. We had to put up the best we could in a marquee tent, the ground was very hard to sleep on after sleeping in beds at the previous places. Sent Parcel away to home in the morning (Freight 3½ )\n","253":"\nFell in 8.30 am & marched to Goderwaersvelde. Rather a large town about 8 miles from Reninghelst & about 2 Kilometres on the French side of the France-Belgian border. Pte Le Clerk rented a room in a Hotel (estaminet) here, & as it is a double bed I am sharing it with him. It will be a treat to get between the sheets again. The rent is one Franc for the night.\n","254":"\nThis last couple of days it has been very wet & bitterly cold. My word it was a treat to sleep in a decent bed once again, I didn't like getting up in the morning. The people about here nearly all speak exceptionally good English. Everywhere it is very muddy. The trees are becoming to get bare of leaves now as it is well into Autumn here. The Germans seem to pushing well into Rumania, they have captured Constanza, Rumania's chief Port.\n","255":"\nWe are all busy packing up this morning. It is still very wet & dreary. Yesterday we went up to Mont des Cats monastry & had a look through it, it is now used for a clearing stn. A very old & \nbig\n large place on top of a very large hill, it is a splendid view from the top. We left Goderwaersvelde about 9.30 am & arrived at Caestre about 12.30 pm. Entrained left about 2.30 pm for Pt Remy (about 3 miles from Abbeyville. We came round by Calais, Boulogne, Etaples & Abbeyville. It took us just about 12 hours. Travelling in vans. The whole Fld Amb & Transport nearly took up a whole train.\n","256":"\n We arrived at Pt Remy about 2 am & marched to our billets in a village called Monflieres. Still very wet. Slept all the morning, very tired. I have a pretty bad cold, but it is getting better now. Went through the church here (R.C.). They always have a nice church no matter how big the village, I suppose it is on account of the one religion.\n","257":"\nGeneral Parade & Roll call in the morning. Went into Abbeyville with Fred Ryan in the morning & we stopped all day getting back to camp about 9 pm. Abbeyville is about 4 miles from here & is a very large place. There is nothing of interest though bar the Catherdal (R.C.) & the Triangle. We went through the Catherdal & nearly all over the town. Had a real good time.\n","258":"\nThere were 4 officers & 4 sergeants presented with service recognition cards this morning. The O.C. complimented the whole Ambulance on its work since being in France. We are getting very poor food. Very cold.\n","259":"\nA very bleak day. The bearers of A section are billeted in a loft, & it is very comfortable. There is a stove in the room which keep the place very warm. This is a very small village but they have a very nice church here. There are also three cafes which all sell beer, so it is a home for the \nBhoys\n. We play five hundred all day to pass the time away. 25 per cent leave to Abbeyville is only now granted.\n","260":"\nAs we have to have a pass now to go to Abbeyville I put in for leave & obtained it from 2 pm till 8 pm. Went into town with Freddy Ryan. The military police are very strict & keep on demanding our passes. Saw bill Freeman in Town. Wrote ten Post cards & a letter & sent them away. Received 2 letters by the mail today got home about 9.30 pm.\n","261":"\nFell in at 10 am & left Monflieres for Vauchelles a distance of about thirteen Kilometres (about 8 miles). Vauchelles les Domart is only a very small village & we are billeted in very dirty houses. It was an ideal day for marching today, but started to rain during the evening. There are plenty of apples about here. Autumn is now nearly over, & most of the trees have shed their leaves. Plowing & sowing have started, & everybody seems to be busy.\n","262":"\nWe left Vauchelles-les-Domart about 9.30 am & marched to Picquigny arriving there about 2 pm. It was very muddy & raining all the way, owing to having very bad boots my feet were soaken wet. It was very hilly country we passed through & altogether the scenery was very pretty. Picquigny is a fairly large place & now is full of Australians & Tommies. Had a look round the town during the evening. Paid 40 Francs in the evening.\n","263":"\nThere appears to be a very large factory near here as the whistle is continually blowing. We are billeted in what used to be a fairly large place & A. section Bearers are in a large room on the third floor, we are very comfortably quartered. 7 bearers & 3 tent division are allowed leave to Amiens daily, I am putting in for leave tomorrow, but as only small percentage is allowed off I may not get it. The weather is very good now but very cold of a morning.\n","264":"\nWe had gas helmet drill with the box respirators & a route march in the morning, owing to having bad boots & sore feet I didn't go on the route march. There was a football match on this afternoon between this Amb & the 16th Battalion, the 16th Battalion won. About thirty of us had to go down to the Somme river & wash waggon in the afternoon.\n","265":"\nGot leave for Amiens & after waiting 3 hrs for a train we eventually arrived there. It is about 8 miles from here & is a large City. I had a splendid time.\n","266":"\nWe fell in 9 am & marched out of the town for about a mile & a half, where we were inspected by the DADMS. ADMS & an English Colonel. The Ambulance was complete including the transport. It rained slightly during the afternoon. Went for a route march about two miles out, up on top of a big hill from where a very good view of the surrounding district can be obtained.\n","267":"\nIt was a very cold morning, everybody is shivering with the cold. The football match between the 4th Fld & the 16th Btn that was to be held this afternoon was postponed on account of the rain. Raining all day, very heavy at times. As it was too wet to go out I stopped in all day & played cards. I also wrote a letter home, but as the post office had closed I couldn't post it.\n","268":"\nFell in 8.45 & after marching about a mile we enbussed to Ribemont a village about 21 miles from here & about 3 miles south of Albert. We came by large French motor busses capable of carrying 32 in each. They weren't very comfortable, but never the-less it was better than walking. We arrived in Ribemont about 2.30 & after treading through knee deep mud we got to our huts. It is about the muddiest place outside the line. I noticed a good few German prisoners repairing the roads, as I came through the different places. It is again raining tonight.\n'\n","269":"\nThis isn't a very big village. It was a fine day to day I can tell you we all appreciated the warm sun. Saw Clive Dwyer in the evening. We didn't do anything all day, so I wrote four letters in the afternoon. The Huts we are in are light structures with tarpaulins thrown over they. We are expecting to be here for a few day. Saw Dan Dignian & Tom Turnbull in the 13th Btn.\n","270":"\nIt was very misty until about 10 oclock this morning. This evening I can hear a rather a heavy bombardment on our left. Went for a route march about a couple of miles out on to the top of a big hill where a splendid view of the surrounding district can be obtained, There was a very heavy bombardment all night no news though. A German Airoplane bombed the Div. Rest station.\n\n11 Saturday\nThere were 12 casualties.\nThe bombardment is still continuing. The 4th Fld Amb played the 4th Machine gun Coy League foot ball this morning, scores M.G. Coy 6,","271":" Fld 3. & we again played the Royal Engineers in the afternoon (socker) scores R.Es 3 to nil. Saw Jim Lihou & Bob Stewart in the evening. The days are very misty & cold now.\n","272":"\nThere was a very exciting game of socker between the 4th Machine gun Coy & the Royal Engeers Score M.G. Coy 1 to nil. The bombardment reached a \nvery\n high standard during the night\n","273":"\nThere is word that the bombardment is from here right up to the sea on the whole of the western Front. It is a very bleak day. We are all packed up ready to go up into the trenches. We left Ribemont about 1 pm & marched to Dernancourt a distance of about four miles. The roads were exceptionally muddy in places. Received a letter from home & one from Doris also a \nletter\n Parcel of cigarettes from O. Turner.\n","274":"\nMy word the German prisoners are made work, road maintenance generally. They seem to be well looked after though. We fell in about 8 am & marched to Longueval. It is absolutely the worst march I have done in my life. We had to contend with being blocked up with traffic, mud, etc. We are now about 4 miles from the line. Fritz put up a good few big shells on a hill about 300 yds away. As we were coming in I saw the Prince of Wales going back on a horse.\n","275":"\nOne of the big shell burst in a tent belonging to the 13th Fld Amb. killing one wounding two. It was an exceptionally cold morning this morning, nearly Freeze a person. Fritz is still shelling the hill. Detailed for road making all day. We have to take about 15 inches of cloggy mud off the road & put down metal, it keeps a fellow very warm this weather. Everywhere about this place there is about 12 inches of mud. Very cold evening. Most of the fellows are living in huts I am in a dug out.\n","276":"\nThere was a rather heavy frost this morning & it was bitterly cold. Was put on orderly room messenger all day, but it was very quiet. There were about six German airoplanes over this morning one was brought down near Flers. They dropped a few bombs, one killed a 13th Fld Amb fellow, a Tommy several Horses & wounded four men. There are a fair amount of Casualties go through here.\n","277":"\nWe buried six poor beggars yesterday who had either been killed in action or died of wounds. About 8 am A section went up to the East Flers dressing station, it is about 1½ miles behind the line. There are shells bursting all round us, Fritz is putting a good few over. We are camped in dug outs here I saw the German airoplane that was brought down yesterday, also a \":tank\" which got stuck in the mud here.\n","278":"\nIt snowed nearly all night & this morning. Everywhere is all white with snow. It rained nearly all day & was terribly cold. We went down for water in the morning & took a patient down in the night, a trip I will never forget, we were up to our waist in mud nearly all the way, it was terrible. We carry for about 800 yds then we wheel by a trolly for about a mile.\n","279":"\nIt is very bleak & cold. We don't get very many \ncases\n wounded here, but a good few with trench feet. We are about 300 yds east of the village of Flers.\n","280":"\nThe artillery about here keeps up a continual bombardment on Fritz's trenches although at some times it isn't so loud. Fritz is putting rather large shells nearly all round our dressing station some bursting only a few yards away. An Officer out of the Pioneer Btn was killed & about 8 wounded by one shell, also 2 stretcher bearers out of the 13th Fld Amb were wounded. Saw one of Fritz's ammunition dumps blown up, it was rather a pretty sight.\n","281":"\nIt is misty this morning & there are a good few patients to be carried down, our squad carried a wounded German down, he was a very young fellow. With continual treading in the mud on the track it is getting much deeper & worse, we go over our knees in it now, it is awful. Fritz must have good observation because he puts a good few shells on this hill & if he could only put them about 100yds to the right it would be finish us, he has the range of us nicely\n","282":"\nThere was a very heavy mist this morning but it cleared away about 10 am. Fritz is still shelling this hill including shrapnel he shells the village of Flers very much. There were great air activities about dinner time it was very exciting to watch the airoplanes diving & firing at one another. 2 German airoplanes were brought down (smashed) one of ours was brought down by a German airoplane (both pilot & observer were wounded) & another had to land owing to engine defects.\n","283":"\nOur squad has been very lucky, we have had only one night carry so far. The airoplanes were again active this morning, but were a long way away, so we hadn't such a view as yesterday, I saw one of ours beaten down. Fritz is putting shrapnel very close to us this morning. I suppose we average one carry every twelve hours, & by jove considering the conditions we have to go through it is enough. Very fine day sun shining nearly all day.\n","284":"\nIt was a very bleak day today. Our squad were on ration fatigue this morning & while we were away Fritz put 12 large shells all round the place we are camped in, one blew the cooks quarters to smithereens, but none of the amb men were hit. A pioneer working near by was killed & 3 wounded, so I reckon us being away at the time was fate. playing cards all the afternoon to pass away the time.\n","285":"\nIt was raining all day & was very miserable. Things have been very quiet for this last 24 hours, bar the artillery firing every now & again Fritz put over a few shells, but they all landed in unoccupied country doing no damage. We have a rum issue every day, & we don't fare too bad regarding food.\n","286":"\nWe were rather busy in the morning with stretcher cases squads & Major Bently shifted to Brigade headqrts. There are now 4 squads left here. Quiet in the evening.\n","287":"\nFritz is still shelling all round here. He put over a good few shrapnel shells this evening but did no damage. I saw 2 airoplanes come down in flames today, one landed all right (one of ours) but the other was burned completely (? Who's it was). We now have to carry about 400 yds & then wheel the patient to Brigade Hqrts (about 800 yds) it is much better than the other carry. It was very misty this morning but wasn't so cold as it was previously. There were 4 officers (Tommies) killed at B. Hqrts & 9 men wounded about dinner time\n","288":"\nIt was a bitterly cold morning. We don't get any news up this way at all, so it will be a treat to get a paper when we get out. We were relieved about 10 am & went per light railway train to Delville Wood & then walked to Longueval. Pretty near as soon as we arrived W.O. Baber had all of us carting the makings of three huts over here from the Engineers Depot. I am living in a tent\n","289":"\nThe first four squads of A Section were detailed for duty as stretcher bearers for the next 24 hours. I am in No 4 squad. We had three trips to do, most of the patients are suffering from trench feet & influenza of course there are\na good few wounded too. There are a good few go through here daily. We have to wheel the patients for about three hundred yds, carry about 200 yds then wheel trolly for about 1½ miles, & then carry about 200 yds where they are entrained.\n","290":"\nMy word the Australian Comfort funds are doing great work here, something to eat, \nor\n smokes & a cup of coffee are obtainable all hours of the day. Fritz put over a few big shells about 300 yds from here every day, one of his shells killed a German prisoner yesterday. As we were working all last night, we hadn't to work today. Fritz put over a good few shells tonight, there were 2 Tommies killed & 2 wounded also 2 of our horses killed. Some were very close to our tent.\n","291":"\nIt was very foggy all day. Fritz is still shelling all round us, he done some damage to the artillery about here, both killing & wounding some of the artillery men. My word it is very cold. Working on the road all day, we scrape the mud off & put down chalk rock, all seem to buck into the work well, as it is the only means of getting warm. Posted 8 letters this evening. Was paid £ 2.17.4 being a double pay.\n","292":"\nThere was a very heavy frost this morning. Detailed for stretcher bearer from here to where the patients are entrained. We had rather a quiet time though, most of the patients were either sick or had trench feet. Received a Parcel (Xmas) from home & one from Mrs Daisly. pcl from home well got up. not so cold tonight.\n","293":"\nAs we were working last night we now have today off. Everything very quiet.\n","294":"\n4 squads out of A Section & B Section fell in 6 am & entrained at Longueval for Dernancourt & from Dernancourt we marched to the Anzac Rest station just out of Buire a distance I suppose of about three miles. It is a beautiful clear day but there is rather a sharp wind blowing. The rest of the Ambulance went up to Delville wood. The 3rd Fld Amb. are looking after the Rest station here. had a good bath this evening, it was needed very much.\n","295":"\nRaining during the day, just about enough to make the ground muddy. Detailed as clerk in the admittance tent. There was nothing much to do after we got rid of a very big sick parade. There were sounds as of a big bombardment on the right. This place has been condemned & has to be evacuated completely by Saturday next. Received 2 letters, the first to be addressed to this unit from Australia.\n","296":"\nReveille goes at 6.30 here, but as all of us have been used to getting up at 8 am, we have never attended the 7 am parade this two mornings. The 1st Fld is in charge of this place now. Relieved about 10 am. packed up & left here 1.30 pm for Ribemont about 2 kilometres away. Both my heels are blistered & it is a struggle to keep on walking. My cold is getting very bad, hadn't much sleep during the night through coughing.\n","297":"\nThe rest of the Ambulance joined us up about 8 am this morning, They left Longueval at 1 am & came nearly the same course as we came. We are billetted in the third storey of a storage shed of a french flour mill. The mill is wholly worked by waterwheels & is still working. My cold is still keeping very bad. Things here are very quiet. Took very bad in evening & admitted to Hospital. Temp 102\n","298":"\nThere are a good few sick here, & pretty near as soon as they are cleared to the C.C.S. batches of others come in. The place is full all the time. The general complaint is influenza, but patients with influenza are not now sent away. I have the general complaint every bone in my body is aching, altogether feel very sick.\n","299":"\nWe get fairly good attention here. A good few \nof th\n fellows come every now & again to see me, including fellows out of the 13th Batt. I put in a terrible night & had to be given morphia to deaden the pain in my back. The hospital is on the base of the flour mill.\n","300":"\nWe are having very wet weather here now, it rains every day. Still keeping very crook.\n","301":"\nDischarged from hospital, although I am still feeling pretty sick, the whole of my body is full of pains. Everyone is discharged as soon as they begin to get better. There are a good few fellows in the ambulances suffering from Influenza, some are confined to their beds. Went back up to our billets again. Spent rather a crook night. Had a touch of rheumatics in my right foot during the night.\n","302":"\nIt was raining & snowing when I got up this morning; as the ground was wet the snow melted a soon as it fell. We have a route march every morning & afternoon now. I am exempt for a couple of days, therefore do not go out on same. It gets very monotonous in the billets all day, most of the chaps play cards & gamble to pass away the time.\n","303":"\nI am still keeping pretty crook, & a good few more have contracted influenza, three out of the ambulance have been evacuated to hospital.\nIt is very funny here of a night time, everything is very quiet, when someone starts coughing & in the space of a minute you can hardly hear yourself talk for the coughing, nearly everybody starts. It is still keeping very wet & dreary, everywhere is very muddy.\n","304":"\nThis is a rotten place, there are only about two bits of shops & a few off side places here, & my word a fellow is hit up too when he goes to buy anything, I think they double the price for Australians. There are great peace negotiations on Germanys part, Everyone here would sincerely welcome peace, I hope it wont be long coming.\n","305":"\nThere is some talk of us not going back to the trenches until January 5th. I hope it is correct, as it will be great to be out of that terrible place for Xmas & New Year. \"C section\" went to \nVauchelles\n Cardonnettes. We are shifting Monday to Vignacourt about 12 miles from here. Was paid 40 Francs (£ 1-8-8) today, I am now 8\/- overpaid received three letters by todays mail.\n","306":"\neverything is keeping very quiet, nearly everybody has still got colds. I am getting slightly better now although I still having the hacking cough. B section moved to Flesselles tonight)x It is still keeping very dreary but not wet.\nX","307":"\n\n17 Sunday\nWe play 500 to pass the time away. I havent been on a route march on Fatigue since I have been here. Church service was held up in our billet tonight.\n","308":"\nEverything was cleaned up during the morning ready for departure. Fell in at 2 pm & marched to the railway siding about a kilometre the other side of Buire. Owing to being ill I never carried my equipment or blankets. We entrained & left about 5 pm for Vignacourt about 24 miles distance, arriving there about 10 pm. We are billeted about 10 mins from the railway station.\n","309":"\nWent on sick parade this morning, I have nearly lost my voice through the cold I have got. Our billets aren't up to the standard here, we are very cramped for room. This is a fair size town, with a large catherdal. It started snowing at dinner time & is still continuing. I think it has set in. Got three letters by todays mail, but they were old ones.\n","310":"\nDoing nothing all day. Feeling pretty crook & very weak. Leave is given to Amiens but it is very difficult to get in & out of that place, as there is no train service here you have to depend upon a lift in a motor lorry or else walk, it is about ten miles from here. It was rather a nice day today, the sun was shining nearly all day, but it wasn't too warm.\n","311":"\nWent on sick parade, & as the doctor informed me that I was too weak to walk about I was to be admitted to hospital. There are a good few fellows evacuated to General Hospitals from here. Nearly everyone in the Ambulance are still very crook, suffering from colds & Influenza It rains nearly every night now.\n","312":"\nConsidering our position here we get looked after fairly well. The Hospital is an old barn & we are sleeping on straw, Great hopes of an enjoyable Christmas being spent are anticipated, arrangements are now being made for \nan enjoyable time\n such. I am taking tonics & am just picking up my appetite again.\n\n23 Saturday\nThe weather hasn't been too bad of late, we actually get a glimpse of the sun now. I was informed today that the","313":" is the longest day here, but it still remains very cold well into the month of march, so we have a long while to go yet. There are a large amount of Xmas pcls coming in now.\n","314":"\nDischarged from Hospital. Not feeling too bad now although rather week. Plucking geese for tomorrows spread this evening.\n","315":"\nA cold, bleak, windy day. Rained during the evening. Everything quiet during the day except for a few getting drunk. Received boxes of gifts from Colonel Beaston of Newcastle (original O.C. of this unit) in the morning. The boxes contained sweets, tinned goods, playing cards, tobacco, pipes, etc. We spent a very enjoyable time in the evening at a large room in an \"Estaminet\". There was a splendid spread including Roast stuffed Geese, Baked & boiled potatoes, Cabbage, Tarts, cakes, Xmas pudding Soft drinks. Wine & beer. The room was very well decorated. A concert was indulged in after.\n","316":"\nGot up about 7 am & walked to Canaples (2½ miles) where we caught the 8.30 am train for Longpre & after waiting close on three hours we caught another train for Amiens. Had a very enjoyable time in Amiens. Had a good bit of shopping to do. Made myself a present of an \"Onoto' Fountain pen for Xmas 1916. We came the same way home Arrived home about 10 pm very tired.\n","317":"\nRather a fine day. Went on dental parade & after examining my teeth (I have two to be filled) the Dentist gave me an appointment at 10 am tomorrow. Everyone seems to be getting rid of their colds now, there aren't hardly any crook now. Writing letters all the afternoon. The country round here is very hilly & rather very pretty. The French people very seldom build fences round their ground. It is a very cold night.\n","318":"\nA very heavy frost on the ground this morning, very cold & bleak all day. Went to the Dentist at 10 am & after putting a bit of filling in one of my teeth (about 5 minutes work) he gave me another note to call tomorrow. It is absolutely ridiculous I reckon standing out in the very cold weather for 3 hrs. for 5 min. treatment. Detailed for filling the water cart out of a well in the afternoon. Very cold monotonous job.\n","319":"\nWell I have \ngot\n my teeth finished at last. went up at 10 am this morning & the Dentist finished filling them. Wrote three letters today. The A.D.M.S. Inspected A section including the transport, this afternoon. We had to go about half a mile away & as soon as we came back, I was detailed as orderly room messenger. I only had one message to go on though. Raining tonight.\n","320":"\nA kit inspection was held this morning, Result! I have to change my mounted equipment for dismounted. I prefer the mounted. Arrangements are being made for another evening New Years night. Not on any duties during the day. Two of our fellows overstopped leave in Amiens & were today awarded 3 days C.B.\n","321":"\nVery quiet all day. New Years eve kept up by some of the \nBhoys\n. Carrying a bit of timber during the morning.\n\n"}}
