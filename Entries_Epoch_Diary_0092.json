Very muggy this morn. \n\nWe just missed a beautiful storm this afternoon anyhow we got a cool breeze out of it which was a great relief. Measles has broken out on board there are about 20 in the hospital up to date & more are expected. We will be quarantined at Colombo I expect.

No sooner we anchored than the boat was swaramed \n\nwith the niggers, and what fun the lads had with same. Such as beating down the niggers in their price of goods. I had charge of the Guard on the boat to keep off the niggers but one may just as well have sat down for all the good we did. It was a grand sight to see them coaling the Boat.

We arrived at Aden at 9.PM. we were under way again at 1.AM. which meant we did not see Aden\n\nagain\n. We could not see much as regards scenery because the darkness blottes everything which may have been interesting.

At 6 Oclock the sun was rising in the horizon. I watched to rise it was just like a ball of fire. At 7 Oclock we started to stear along faster \nor rather\n the ship I mean. Up till 6 Oclock to night we have passed 4 steamers, which is a record for this journey. I watched the sun going out of sight this evening it was just \nthe\n (same like a ball of fire).

I has been very funny here some of the sgt have been stealing\n\none anothers towels ect. All along the trip a last I began to kick against it because some one or other of them have stolen my soap, & soap box which almost ended in blows. I have a Sgt \nwhich\n in my Company whom says he \nhas been\n was a Chaplin or something in that line, well somebody stole his soap (I) for a Joke & when we were at mess \nwhe\n called us to order and asked for the man who stole his soap then the fun began.

During the day the wind got stronger. There \n\nwas a big swell on also but it made no impression on our boat, she was just like a rock. We entered the Gulf of Suez about 12 Oclock, it was a beautiful sight to see the mountains of North Africa which appeared to be clay, but of course they are of rock. It was beautiful to see them \nb\n they are all \nworked\n chalterd by the rain.\n","30":"\n\nSill steaming along the Gulf of Suez this morning early Arrived in Port of Suez 9 Oclock Harbour built of Breakwaters As soon as \nwe landed but\n we landed in Suez we heard how the Australians had been playing up in Cairo.

We were working about a hour when heavy firing began big guns were firing machjne gun were talking & the rifles spitting. It was very much like as though they were keeping up Kings Birthday. Well it was that hot the firing I mean, that we had to lye down in the trench to miss the bullets from the Turks they knew we were there. \nWhere\n il the bullets were shelling up dust all around us. When thing eased up a big we continued. We were not trouble much afterwards. We \narried\n arrived back\n\nhome at 2 PM. this morning. There is a big hill on our right flank.
