Marched to Anzac camp – 4 miles- carrying all our gear, officers gear carried in wagons. Pitched our own tents & after learning that tea would not be provided, turned in at 7 p.m.\n","39":" Food filthy in camp, having our meals in canteen.

The boys had not received their parcels or billies, so we had bully & rice for lunch. Had not been paid for a month & everyone else was bankrupt.

Millions of flies & insects on the ground.\n\n","81":" Sgt. Weir died of smallpox. Wagon supplied to convey body to the cemetery, as a hearse could not be obtained, though gun carriages were easily procurable.

Our infantry were digging in whilst we held the line, then when our guns came on the scene, we retired, gradually falling to rear of the entrenched infantry, thus causing the enemy to advance & fall into the trap already laid for them. Bringing in wounded was no easy task, as we were often between ours & the enemy’s line during the retirement.

Reached clearing station at De Babbas & had to get over 100 wounded away on camel conveys & cacolets. Major Chisholm said they had decided to leave 12 men & an officer with the wounded, as they expected a heavy counter attack from the enemy. We were left without an escort but Col. Dixon stayed with us & by 9 p.m. we had every man away & leaving the tent s & gear, we reached Oghratina with the wounded at midnight.

The Yeomanry who had been fighting all day received the order & retired on the tick, but through a very fortunate error, the N.Z. or our General did not receive it, so kept at the enemy. Gen. Cox was not more than a mile from the firing line during the whole action & his Bde. were doing fine work under his orders. The N.Z. mounted under Gen. Chaytor brought off a fine charge & carried two redoubts, then the whole line advanced & Rafa was in our hands with all hands, including 20 Hun officers & men; 30 Turkish officers, 1500 other ranks; 4 guns; 15 machine guns; 3000 rifles, stores, ammunition & the whole of their camel & other transport. Fully 300 Turkish dead were in the trenches & redoubts & 260 wounded went through our hands. Our casualties were 93 killed, 11 died of wounds & 370 wounded. We had a busy time on the field with wounded, having to gallop within 200 yds. of the firing line with the wagons for the wounded. My mate, Robinson hit in the\n\n \n\nabdomen whilst carrying & died two hours later. Davis hit on the back whilst dressing wounded on the field. Taubes over bombing, but did very little damage.

Two 4.7 guns captured & used against the enemy by N.Z. mounteds, who sighted\n\nthe gun down the barrel, not knowing how to fire them & shells bursting 100 yds in front of gun when it was fired. The 53rd. Welsh division failed miserably & left 400 wounded on the field. Our casualties were 600 killed & 2000 odd wounded, nearly all of them infantry. This was a fearful bungle, as the mounted men were on the beach holding the town, when they had to gallop away owing to the failure at Ali Muntar of our infantry. Everybody who took part in it say the infantry never stood a chance owing to enemy’s strong position & we attacked with a very small chance, backed up with seven batteries against about 40 used by the enemy. Murray never left Arish during the whole action, we being with him as reserve Brigade, yet were not called upon in spite of the way things went with our troops. Wounded going down all day in cattle & goods trucks, the medical arrangements were disgraceful, many wounded being out in the open on the sand for 12 hours, owing to lack of hospital accommodation.\n","203":" Things normal again; unit sports at Marsaaid – second in 100 yds & relay race.\n","204":" Rugby v","205":" reg. being another scoreless draw, though we played an extra 10 minutes either way.\n\n \n","206":" Left Arish 8 a.m., camping at Gowaiid for the night; leaving for Rafa at 9 a.m. next day; had lunch in the field where the action took place last Jany.

Our Bde. had a very hot time, the machine gunners doing fine work & saved the whole lot from being captured by the enemy. They fed their guns at ranges from 22 yds. on the enemy reinforcements Marching up to counter attack. Enemy heavily shelled our station containing wounded, as the Ayrshire guns had rushed into action under the hospital flag, causing us to make a hurried departure with the wounded.

Heaps of gun ammunition & scores of guns & wagons were left by the Turks, who were now making a stand at Sharieh station, but the men soon had this in our hands, suffering heavily from enemy shelling. After leaving the wadi, we had a galop of 8 miles through Sharieh, causing a break in the enemy lines. We captured a dump with 75,000 shells & 3 billion round of S.A.A. At 4 p.m. we mounted again, charging an enemy redoubt after a 3 mile gallop, but they succeeded in getting away before we could reach it & their guns gave us a very sultry time, and impossible for us to to pursue the retreating force till the guns had been captured by the 2nd Bde.

The 4th absolutely showed the white feather, losing 9 guns & making no attempt to go to their batteries relief, the result being 32 of 4th Bde. & gun crew captured. This retirement caused an awful mess as the Turks held the main wadi to Es Salt, thus causing much anxiety to our men operating in the hills. We had to fight a rearguard for a squadron of the 11th, then returned 2 miles to another post, holding this till we were relieved by 6th mtd. Bde. then going into the hills with the N.Z. troops, as we had to hold a line so that our men from Es Salt would not be cut off. Held our post all night, the enemy being only a mile from our only road of escape from Es Salt. Gen. Allenby & staff came out this afternoon directing operations for the retirement. Enemy attacked 4th post & again they retired, having to rely on the guns to knock the Turks off during the night. Rations are scarce & have not had any rest for two days & nights of constant fighting. \n\n2: Still on post with N.Z. who have gone in as infantry digging a new track to allow our men to get through from Amman & Es Salt. Duty all night.\n\n. \t\n\n3: Enemy still being held in check; moved to Jordan river escorting two batteries, which bombarded Red Hill at daybreak.

N.Z. men holding the line.\n\n4: Moved off at 4 a.m., fighting a rearguard for men from Es Salt & 4th Bde; the whole line being withdrawn to bridgehead owing to failure of 4th Bde. Stayed in the hills until 10 p.m., being the last to get away, all our men from Es Salt coming through safely with 900 prisoners & 26 machine guns.

Of course we always sleep in our uniform & gear handy, only removing our clothes when washing.\n","445":" At 2 a.m. a very heavy enemy bombardment opened, shells screeching overhead & bursting on every ridge. Orders to stand by for instructions. At 3 a.m. the Huns attacked Vaux post, knocking our men (14) out of it in half an hour. Fire was used to attack Mussallabah from the rear, but our boys simply turned around in the post & fought them, leaving their main front to our artillery. We reinforced the 3rd regt on Vaux post, going in at 3 a.m. The\n\n \n\nshell fire was heavy & we had a lively few hours after firing our first shot on the advancing enemy; our guns were mounted on the skyline & presented a good target for artillery. Main attack was launched by the Huns, with a division of Turks split up on each flank. Hun infantry left Vice, then taking he Bluff, cutting off Maskareh & the men holding the post, but our machine guns & artillery soon got amongst them, causing a hasty retreat to the wadi, but still holding the Bluff. ","446":" regt. rushed up with fixed bayonets, taking the Bluff in their first charge, then recapturing Vice post, cutting off the Hun force that had penetrated our line at these points, result being the capture of 600 Huns & 70 odd dead enemy troops on the field. When the Turks saw that our counter attack was successful, they would not advance on our post or that held by N.Z. mounted & even turned their own guns on the remainder of the Huns who were supporting the main attacking party. Fahey, one of our boys, brought in 27 Huns & 6 automatic rifles, going out & ordering them to surrender, being only armed with a revolver. At 9 a.m. all was over in the wadi in front of his position, leaving over 1000 troops & numerous\n\n \n\nmachine guns & automatic rifles. It was a fearful day, 117 in shade & we were in the open all day, wearing steel helmets, this being an order. Shelled all day & was glad when it was over, so we could dig a gunpit under cover of darkness. The Huns got all the 2 regt’s. gift stuff & issue beer when they took the Bluff, but our boys got it all back from them after the action taking it from the Huns, who had filled their haversacks with the good things. Over £1000 were at hdqrs. in the line, as we were to be paid this morning, but the orderly men were sent to our led horses camp with money, as soon as the action commenced. Our horses were heavily shelled during the day, having to take cover in the wadi & could not get near water troughs. N.Z. troops patrolled the Aujur at 9 p.m., causing the enemy to move to his original line, 270 prisoners being brought in by N.Z.

Huns & Turks would not mix with one another in our lines, the Turks continually jeering at the Huns. When the prisoners left for Jerusalem, the Huns only were allowed to strip & bathe in the wadi Aujir, yet for doing this, our men have received severe punishment & a few N.Z. as our drinking water is pumped from this same stream. A staff officer was responsible for this action, which was the means of causing strong remarks from our men. Stayed on post all night only three men on a gun. Enemy shelled our line, causing few casualties.\n","449":" Small bodies about, taking in the wounded, leaving the dead for our men to bury. Col. Bell & Mjr.
