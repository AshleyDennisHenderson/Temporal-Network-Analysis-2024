Wednesday the ","1":" I started work again. My back is now almost well, so I was put to work doing odd jobs about the Factory Yard, such as unloading Railway trucks of coal. etc.etc.\n\nON","2":" the Flags were flying for the Crown-Prince’s Birthday.\n\nBoth the War-Flag and the National-flag were flying. The War-Flag is white, with the Black spreading eagle in the centre, and the Iron Cross in the top corner near the mast. \n\nThe National flag is the usual Red, - White and Black.\n","3":" May the","4":" was a Public holiday – which the Germans call Himmelfahrt, Meaning in English, A heaven Holiday, or Saints Day. On Sunday the","5":" I was searched again by the Germans for Money, Valuables &\n","6":"\n\nleather.\n\nOn Sundays and holidays when we are not working, we are all locked up in the barrack, and not allowed to roam about the factory like we used to do. \n\nThe trouble was caused through two Russians escaping. \n\nAt meal times we have a ticket for our soup, which we have to hand in to be checked every day. We also have to take a ticket to work with us in the mornings, and give it in as we return to the barrack at night. \n\nThe idea of these tickets is that if we escape, they will discover the fact in the afternoon when we all are finished work and return to the barrack, And so be able to send search parties out. And also warn the Police & civillians, before we have a chance of getting many miles away.\n","7":"\n\nIt is to be hoped that they will soon alter things and give us a bit more freedom, If not they will find us all missing some day soon. The Barrack is composed of two rooms of about 100ft by 40 ft. One is used as a sleeping chamber, and has one hundred and forty beds in it. the men are all mixed, Some French, Belgians, English, Russians & Poles, as well as some Colonial’s.\n\nThe place is alive with rats & mice, The fleas will not let you rest at night.\n\nThe Russians are the cause of the fleas, They will not wash or bath themselves from one weeks end to the other,They go to bed with all their clothes on, Just as they come in from work. Some do not even remove their boots and hat.\n\nThe Frenchmen are the cause of the rats & mice being about, They will not let a cat stay in the barrack for long without killing and eating it.\n\nI brought a cat in to clear the\n","8":"\n\nthe mice away once, and about two hours afterwards when I had cause to go to the barrack to get something, I saw this cat cleaned & skinned ready for the pot, and the mice were as bad as ever, until finally the Germans took a hand in getting rid of them themselves.\n","9":" the","10":" Late reports say that the Germans have been pushed back in the region of Ypres by the French. They claim that the artillery fire was the worst experienced during the war.\n","11":" the","12":" and Monday the","13":" are public holidays. On Monday 5 Russians escaped, but were brought back a day or two after, and unmercifully beaten by the Germans with a whip.\n\nOn Thursday night I had to go to work to help a civillian, needless to say I made myself such a nuisance, and pretended to be so silly & too thickheaded to understand what\n","14":"\n\nI was required to do, that the civilian got that wild and disgusted with me, so that he did all the work himself while I looked on.\n\nOn Friday seven more guards were sent to look after us, and prevent us from escaping.\n\nThe German civilians also have to keep their eyes on us. They have to come to the barrack and take us to work at 6pm, and in the mornings they have to bring us back and hand us over to the Guards at the barrack. They are held responsible if we escape during working hours. \n\nA rumour has come to hand that all British Prisoners of forty-five years of age, married with two or more children are to be repatriated to England. And also all prisoners captured up till the","15":" are to be repatriated to Holland. The weather for some weeks has been nice & pleasant with the exception of one or two very wet days.\n\nThe food has been as usual. (bad.)\n","16":"\n\nThe result of the Ambassador’s visit has been as follows. Three more ventilators have been put in the walls and ceiling of the sleeping barrack, And an extra seat in the night latrine.\n\nEven after these alterations the place is not fit for so many men to live in.\n\nOn","17":" news of the German Offensive was again published.\n\nThis time it is said, that its to be a much larger one more than the last one, The civilians and Guards are always telling us, that in a day or two we will hear that the Germans are in Armentiers and Paris. I try to tell them that it is their last stroke, And that they are like a dying horse giving its last kick, But they will listen to none of it, I told one chap that he had better start learning English, so that he would be ready to speak English, when the English did come here\n","18":"\n\nafter they had beaten their army in France.\n\nHe got very annoyed and would have liked to kill me.\n\nOn Tuesday the","19":" news came through that the Germans had captured 2,000 prisoners both British and French at Rhiems, And that they are still going forwards. The news for Wednesday is that we have effectively stopped them all along the line, Since then untill today Sunday the","20":" no news whatever has come from the Front.\n\nAll the week I was working on night work. To-day they made an alteration in the working hours for night shift as follows.\n\nFrom 1pm in the afternoon till 5pm, then we start again after tea at 6p, and work till midnight, with from midnight to 1pm the following day off. The old times were as follows.\n\nFrom 6pm at night to 6am the following morning. On this time we only worked from 6pm till midnight, and could sleep from midnight till 6am, and also have the following\n","21":"\n\nday off. But with the new time they have us working the whole 12 hours, which means that we do an extra 6 hours work.\n\nThe German papers of Sunday the","22":" that there is a conference between England and Germany, being held in Holland to discuss and arrange the exchanging of Prisoners-of-war on a vast scale. I hope that they come to an agreement and get us all shifted out of this country.\n\nDuring the last week I went to the doctor and asked him to order a change of work for me, which he did, I am now working in the packing rooms in the same factory. The reason why I applied to the Doctor for a change was, because of the new working hours.\n\nTo-day Tuesday June the","23":" I again went to the Doctor, But I am this time suffering from the usual Influenza. The Doctor \n","24":"\n\nordered me to bed for two days.\n\nThe Doctor is a very old man, and he can speak very little English, He is also more considerate for the English than other Nationalities. Every now and again when I feel like having a day or two off work, I go to see him. As soon as I am seated in front of him, he asks me my nationality, then my occupation in civillian life, and the place where I was born. He will then say every word he knows of the English language, and wind up with giving me two or three days (No. Vork). He does not even ask what is the matter, A person may be nearly dead, and all the satisfaction he will get is a day or two (no work.) The Frenchmen are not so badly off as the Russians are, The doctor will give a frenchman a day or two off now and again, But the Russians are sent to work every time.\n\nFrom Sunday the","25":" till","26":" I was feeling a bit off-color again, so did no work\n","27":"\n\nThe latest news from the front is that the British, French & Germans are making very heavy attacks against each other.\n\nOn Thursday June the","28":" the German papers say that, the English are expecting another offensive by the Germans, and are aware of the preparations being made, but that they are not sure of what section the attack will be launched on.\n\nIf all goes well I will have my photo taken to-morrow, and if they are good I will send some home. I have a moustach now and I want a Photo of it for a souvinir.\n\nThe Germans have the prisoners from the civil prisons working about the country in gangs. There is a party of about 30 working in this factory. They are a poor miserable lot and look half starved, they are always asking us for tobacco and food.\n","29":"\n\nThe majority of them are doing terms of imprisonment from three to seven years, and and are mostly military prisoners, - such as deserters.\n\nThere are also a lot of women working here too, The do work every bit as hard as the men, in some cases it is much heavier. They do all sorts of shovel work, unloading coal from railway trucks, chiping mortar off bricks, and such like.\n\nThe Food supply in the county is getting very short. The civilians say they can barely get enough to eat.\n\nThe prices of things and foodstuffs are an awful price. The poorer class of people cannot afford to buy clothing and boots for their children, who consequently have to run about poorly clad and bare footed in winter and summer alike.\n\nThe weather for some time past has been cold, with rain on six or seven occassions. The food has been as it usually is. (bad).\n","30":" and","31":"\n\nOn Friday June the 28th I had to see the manager of the factory. He wanted me to work on the salts again, I told him that I would work if the hours were to be the same as they were before they altered them, And if I was to work on Sundays I was to have time off during the week, He would not alter any of these, so I refused to go back. I am still working in the store rooms.\n","32":"\n\nThe war news for the week was that the Australians had taken a few small villages in the Somme-district. That the Russians are fighting again with the assistance of the French and English troops. And also the papers publish the report of the assination of the German Ambassador in Russia, It is reported that he was assinated by a French or English soldier \n","33":"\n","34":" I wrote a card home to Etta, and I also answered a letter which I received from Miss L. Galloway in Scotland. This Miss Galloway has sent me a parcel on one or two occasions, so the least I cold do was to write and thank her for them. All the week it has been hot, Just the weather for me.\n\nFood is getting ever rarer and scarcer right throughout the country.\n\nWhat little there is f it is an awful price. That rations that the civilians are allowed for the week are. One pond of meat per week generally horseflesh. Seven Kilo Grammes of Potatoes per week, two Kilo Grammes of black bread per week. Bacon and and sausage are issued to the working people by the employers. The amount that they get here is one and a quarter pounds of each per week. Children and persons not working are not \n","35":"\n\nentitled to an issue. If a man is considered not to have done enough work during the week, the employers stop his bacon & sausage issue.\n\nThe majority of the men working in this factory are from 50 to 75 years of age. They have to work as hard as a young fellow of 25 or 30 years. \n\nThe oldest man here is 75 years of age. The majority of Germans that are in civilian clothes are maimed and unfit for service in the Army.\n\nIf a man is able to work and will not, he has all his food-ration-tickets taken from him and is thereby unable to purchase any food whatever, there is nothing left for him to do then but Starve or work, And it is generally the work that he chooses.\n\nAt tis factory lately a lot of new women have started work,\n","36":"\n\nThey are at present engaged in breaking stones, for ballast on the railway lines in the factory yard. They do all manner of work. \n\nsuch as unloading coal from trucks, and I have even seen them engaged for pick and shovel work.\n\nThe Germans generally do not seem to have much respect for their womenfolk, or they would not have them doing this sort of work.\n\nThe women themselves are mostly of the poorer classes, and are more like men than women, They remind me of sack of flour tied around the middle, They seem to have no figure whatever.\n\nThe War news for the week ending July the","37":" is – On Tuesday the German Prime Minister in his speech in the Reichtag, said that Germany could not hope to win the War by force of arms, And that their only chance was to come to an honorable Peace, (on terms.) He was\n","38":"\n\nasked to resign his office. The news of Thursday is that the Germans started another offensive, and have taken 13,000 prisoners of all nationalities. Later reports say that they have been stopped, and that the French have retaken a large number of their prisoners and 3 villages.\n\nTo-nights reports say that the French and English have counter attacked, and advanced a distance of 20 kilometres, Twenty villages and some prisoners were taken in the advance.\n\nTwo Englishmen arrived here today from Soltau, they gave us some very good news concerning the exchanging of Prisoners-of-War to Holland.\n\nJuly the","39":"\n\nThe Parties of civil convicts who at times are brought to this factory to work, were here again to-day. They are half starved & are always asking us for food & tobacco. I was watching a \n","40":"\n\nbunch of about 12 men, fighting like deamons to get a box full of our empty conserve –tins, which we receive in our parcels from England. These tins were in some cases lying there for three weeks or more, But it did not seem to worry them at all, They were scraping and licking them out as fast as they could.\n\nAs we receive these tins from England they are taken from us, and kept in the Guard room. When we want anything for a meal we have to go in and open the tin in the presence of a German, and empty the contents into a bowl or plate. The empty tins are put into a box where the dog belonging to the Guards licks them out, Afterwards when the box is full it is taken down below & tipped where the other tins are.\n\nI was these tins that the men were scraping out, after the dog had the first lick. I is awful to see men in such a state of starvation as this. When I was \n\nJuly\n\nfirst captured I was doing the same thing, Afterwards when I began to get parcels from England there was no necessity to do it. You can imagine what sort of treatment Prisoners-of-War receive, when their own civil prisoners are starved so much as this.\n\nThe reasons why the Germans take our tins from us, is to prevent us from escaping, or getting any poison through in them.\n\nYesterday July the","41":" I was speaking to three girls who have just arrived here from England., their ages are 8, 7, and 5 years. Their Mother is an English woman & their Father is a German.\n\nThey told me that their Father had only just been sent back, He had been interned for a long time in England as a civillian prisoner. Neither the girls or their mother can speak German. It sounds very funny to us to hear English spoken in the streets & by children too.\n\nJuly\n\nWhen I first heard them talking to one another I could hardly believe my ears. The poor kids speak to the German kids in English & the Germans answer them in German, neither can understand the other, Its very funny to watch them. The Eldest girl does not like Germany & wants to go back to England, The second eldest says that she does not like the English, because they take all the food from the poor Germans.\n\nI must mention this little incident as follows, It occurred ond day whilst I was working on the Salt making job. \n\nOne day some little while back I was working at No 2 salt room in the factory, And was using a barrow to wheel the salt about from one place to another, When a German who that morning had stated work for the first time for some months, came and claimed the barrow as his property. He had been fighting in France & had been given\n","42":"\n\nfourteen days leave, he had started work here just to earn a little extra money, during his spare time. The Army pay is only 75 Pfennigs per day for Privates\n\nWell this fellow claimed this barrow & wanted to take it away from me, But I prevented him from doing do, saying that it was mine that I had been using it for some months previous.\n\nWe were arguing a long time over it and who was to have it.\n\nHe would not agree for me to have it, and I would not let him take it, until he could prove to me that it was his absolutely.\n","43":" he commenced to prove that it was his beyond all doubt.\n\nHe said that he had been using it for 8 years before he went to the War, And that his father was using it for 20 odd years before him.\n\nHow can it be yours, said he! I thought that I had better let \n\nJuly and","44":"\n\nhim have it if he could tell it’s pedigree as well as that. I had no chance of going any better than that, so I let him take it before he told any more lies about it.\n","45":" the news of the last few days from the Front, is that the Americans & French have attacked in the region of Rhiems, and have advanced a distance of 30 Kilometres, Capturing 50 villages including the Town of Sossions, There was no mention of Guns or Prisoners taken.\n","46":"\n\nAlmost all the past week has been wet & cold.

The tone of the papers seem to say that this is the end, And indeed everything looks that way too. The German civilians are getting very downhearted and are in doubt about winning. I try to cheer them up a bit by telling them that they wont have much time to learn English before the English come and conquer their country. They are also always complaining about the price and scarcity of all foodstuffs. \n","49":"\n\nRight throughout Germany the Government is calling every man & boy from the age of 18 and upwards for the army. There is a large number of new recruits here in this town of Luneburg. They are always marched around the town singing to try and cheer the population up a little.

The German woman who was cooking for the Guards was watching the fight, She got very excited and was jumping about and clapping her hands.\n\nWhen the fight was over my hands were sore, All my knuckles were skinned through punching the Rusky, The Russians face was in an awful mess. The English & Frenchmen stood by to see fair play & watch that no other Russian joined in. I wish some had joined in, so that we could have given the Russians a proper rough time all round, It was what I was waiting for ever since I left Munster Hospital.\n\nThe way the Russians treated us Australians while we were there sick & wounded, has\n","59":"\n\nmade me take every opportunity of repaying some of it back every time I get a chance. \n\nThe War news of the 20th is that we are advancing on the sections of the Front between Rhiems and Doiai, And have captured a large number of prisoners & guns and villages, Also we have taken a considerable amount of booty.\n\nFood in Germany is getting very scarce, The food that we get served up to us here is scarcely fit to eat.\n\nOn the","60":" the clocks were put back 1 hour for the Daylight saving.\n\nFrom the","61":" to the","62":" the reports published in the German papers were more than satisfactory.\n\nearly reports said that the English had advanced more than 160 Kilometres and captured 40,000 prisoners, 200 Guns, besides a large quantity of other war material, On the Macedonian Front.\n\nThe report of the","63":" says that the British have started another offensive on\n","64":" and","65":"\n\nthe Western Front, extending from the Sea-coast to Ypres. Later reports say that another offensive is in progress in France and that the British & French have captured the Towns of Armentiers, Lens and St Quintin as well as a large quantity of Prisoners, Guns, Material, Etc.\n\nAccording to the Leading Berlin newspaper, the amount of war material captured by the British for the months of July, August and September, on the West Front, are as follows, 493,000 men, over 1,000 big Guns, 60,000 machine guns and considerable dumps of ammunition & other material.\n\nReports of the","66":" that Bulgaria has signed an Armistice with the Entente Powers. The tone of the German papers lead one to believe that Bulgaria is absolutely broken. The conditions of the Armistice provide for the Allies to take over the Administration of all Bulgarian territory, and the management & use of all Railways, for purpose of the allies advance through \n","67":"\n\nher territory, And that the Bulgarian Army is to be demobilised immediately, Also all Prisoners of War are to be repatriated to their respective countries.\n\nFurther reports point out that the Armistice with the Entente and Bulgaria, was arranged by the Bulgarian Government without either consulting the King or the Commander in chief of the Army at the Front. Of late there has been wholesale desertion from the Bulgarian Army. The Break through the Front and advance in Macedonia effected by the Allies, has put the remainder of the Army to rout, and has also completely smashed the moral of the whole country.\n\nThere has been a great deal of unrest and quarreling in the Austria-Hungarian Parliament lately, the outcome of the Armistice with Bulgaria, The country seems to be getting demoralised.\n\nCommunications between Germany and\n","68":"\n\nTurkey are threatened to be destroyed by the advance of our troops in that region.\n\nThe Imperial Chancellor of Germany has resigned owing to the Bulgarian situation.\n\nThe Kaiser has had to form a new ministry, The Socialists are now in power in Germany with Prince Max of Baden at the Head. This is the first time in the History of the German Parliament that Socialists have been in power.\n\nMy only wish now is that the news of Turkey’s surrender will come along.\n\nI hope they succeed in smashing her the same as they have done Bulgaria, Then I do not think it will be long before Austria-Hungary throws down her arms, and so bring Germany to her knees, But somehow I think Germany will give in before our troops get to Germany to smash plans about like the Huns did in France.\n\nIf we can only keep advancing as we have done since Germany’s last offensive of last Spring, It will not be long before we achive the long sought Peace\n","69":"\n\nwith Victory. Then once again I will be on my way home to Sunny New-South-Wales, Never to leave it again unless it is to have another brawl with the Germans, Just to give a little back of what I have received at their hands since I have been prisoner in their country. My advice to any person who meets a good German is to kill him before he goes bad! The only good German in my opinion is a dead one.\n\nTo-day October the","70":" the papers are full of Peace talk.

The majority of the German people believe that this is the end, The people at home are well nigh starved & the moral of the troops is weakening every day. Foodstuffs are very scarce and what there is of it is very dear.\n\nThe rations allowed are 7l;bs of Potatoes per week, 500 Grammes of black bread per day, Meat can be bought at an enormous price, one day per week for three weeks of the month, The fourth week is meatless. 500 Grammes or 1lb is allowed for every adult that is working. Persons not working and children, cannot purchase meat.\n","73":"\n\nClothing is made from paper owing to the scarcity of cotton and wool, The material lasts until it gets wet then falls to pieces.\n\nBoots and other leather goods are very scarce, What there is for sale is very expensive, The poorer class of people cannot afford to buy boots for their children, who consequently have to go about barefooted in winter and summer alike. It is a shame to see all the children suffering from the want of proper and sufficient food and clothing as they are here in this country.\n\nCigarettes are from 15 Pfennigs to 25 Pfn each, Cigars are from one mark upward, Pipe tobacco is unprocurable. Apples cost 50 Pfennig of 6d each.

But now it has ended for the whole world. A little longer and you will see your native land again, Your homes, your loved ones, your friends. You will once more take up your accustomed work.\n\nThe fortunes of war brought you as prisoners into our hands.

The days, the weeks, the weary years crept by, and there was no end in sight. There were many discomforts, irritations, misunderstandings.\n\nYour situation has been a difficult one.

There have been wrongs and evils on both sides.

The barbed wire enclosure is not the proper point of view from which to judge or survey a great nation.\n\nThe War has blinded all nations, but if a true Peace will result in opening the eyes of the peoples to the fact, that their intrests are common, That no difference in Flags, Government, Speech nor nationality, can alter the great truth of fraternity of all men, This war will not then have been fought in vain.

The tide was too low to allow the large warship to go right up to the wharf.\n\nOn arrival at the Quay we were given a very warm reception by the \n","123":"\n \n\nRed-Cross ladies, We were supplied with all sorts of eatables and had some very nice tea served.\n\nAfter we had finished eating our fill we were put in the train with a carriage between six men, And left for Ripon Camp in Yorkshire shortly afterwards, arriving there early the following morning.\n\nI stayed at Ripon Camp for two days, was rigged out in another clean uniform and had all particulars taken again, I was also required to make a statement concerning the attack of the morning of April the","124":" 1919 .\n\nOn the","125":" I was granted one month’s leave and came to London in the afternoon, After going to the Australian Headquarters in Horseferry Road Westminster And messing about there running after clothing and Leave passes for about an hour, I was allowed to go free. I stayed at the Star-\n","126":"\n\nand-Garter Hotel at Putney on the night of the 30th. I continued to stop in London till the","127":" looking at the various places of interest and having a good time generally. Somehow I rather think I deserve a good holiday after my twenty months of Prisonership.\n\nOn the evening of the 3rd of January I left London for Scotland.\n\nI arrived at Edinburgh at about 8am on the morning of the fourth. during the morning I visited the Castle, It stands on a very high rock and commands all the city, It can be seen form almost any part of the country for a mile or two away. The different buildings inside the castle walls were interesting, The Kings & Queens chamber, Dining Hall, castle chappel, Dungeons, and other places, The crown Jewels were beautiful, The keeper explained what the various signs were and also gave us their history.\n\nThe Dining and banqueting hall is a very large room, It was used a little while ago as\n","128":"\n\ngarrison dispensary, But lately has been restored and converted into an Armory of Ancient Scottish wepons and armour. The windows are of stained glass and bear the arms of the old scottish lords.\n\nThe Chappel which is called St Margarets Chappel, is supposed to be the oldest building in Scotland which has a roof over it. It was erected by Queen Margaret who died in the year 1095. In the front of the Chappel and facing toward the city is the big gun, which is termed Mons–Meg. Later in the day I visited the Forth-Bridge. I took the motor bus to Queensferry, where the bridge can be seen the best, It was too cold and windy so I did not attempt to go across it.\n\nThe fourth bridge is the largest and best bridge of its kind in the world. It carries the North-British Railway line across the Queensferry narrows. Its length is a little over one and a half miles, fully two thirds of the distance is over salt water. The central arches of which\n","129":"\n\nthere are three, are each almost one third of a mile in span, and the piers rise to a height of 361 feet above high water mark. The bridge took seven years to construct and was opened by the present king in the year 1890, Its cost was three and a half millions sterling.\n\nAfter I returned from viewing the Fourth Bridge I visited Calton hill and saw the big Prison, Royal high school buildings, Nelsons Monument, The Burns Monument, and the National monument.\n\nThe Nelson Monument is in the form of a tower, which stands on the summit of Calton Hill. From the top a beautiful view of the country can be obtained. It has also time ball arranged on the top which falls at 1pm every day, and by which all clocks throughout the city are regulated.\n\nThe Natiolonal monument is the foundation stone of what was designed to be a “National monument\" on memory of Scotsmen who fell in the battles, by sea and land, in the war with France, It was laid by George the fourth in the year 1822\n","130":"\n\nAll that remains of it is twelve tall columns which when seen from a distance seem to be the ruins of a very beautiful building, But when viewed closely it looks as if it had been started only a few years ago.\n\nAnother historical monument is the “Scott Monument\" which is situated in Princess Street near the Princess Street Railway Station, It is a beautiful structure and was erected in 1840-44 at a cost of £16,000. In the centre of the structure under a canopy is a statue of Scott, and figures from the waverly novels occupy the various niches around the monument. After wandering around the town for a few hours after this, I took train to Dundee and arrived there at about 10pm, I stayed at the Overseas club for soldiers and sailors. The trip from Edinburgh to Dundee was, with the exception of the view of the Grand fleet as we crossed over the fourth-bridge much the same as the ride from London to Edinburgh, In fact all railway journeys are much the same, They all get monotonous\n","131":"\n\nafter the first hour or two. I stayed in Dundee until the","132":" when I got the 8am train for Glasgow, I stopped in Glasgow for one day then took train to Edinburgh stopped there for about 6 hours and then returned to Dundee late at night on the","133":"\n\nOn the","134":" I again went to Glasgow and called on a friend who was prisoner in Germany with me, I stayed there till the evening of the","135":" when I took the express back to London arriving at about 8am on the morning of the","136":"\n\nThe City of Glasgow is very much like Sydney, it is very busy as sea ports generally are, I did not like the place so did not stay there long. There is not much of interest to the traveller either. The tramway system is very good, but it does not come up to Sydney, The cheapness of travelling is miles ahead of Sydney. The distance one can travel on the Glasgow trams for one halfpenny, we have to pay three halfpence for in Sydney. The City of Edinburgh is a very\n","137":"\n\nclean city, It is just the place where I would like to live if it was necessary that I should live over this side of the world, The only drawback to the place is the old fashioned cable-trams, The cable which is always revolving underground is very annoying when it needs greasing.\n\nThe objection that the Edinburgh people have to the ordinary electric trams, is that the Poles that would have to be erected to carry the overhead wires would be a disfigurement to the city.\n\nThe streets of the cities over here look much wider than they really are, the reason being that the shops and business places have no awnings over the footpaths and consequently no posts. Why there are no awnings over the footpaths like Australian cities, is because of the heavy snow falls, If there were awnings and the snow was to fall heavy and bank up on the roof, it would be a source of great danger to the public generally, If it were to fall of in drifts people\n\nwalking along and persons driving on the roads would never know the moment that a drift would occur and fall on them, And bury them, or startle the horse, as the case may be. \n\nThe city of Dundee I liked best of all to spend my holiday in, It was a nice quiet little place, The people were very sociable and everything generally seemed to suit me, It cannot boast of any places of interest except the Tay bridge over the Firth of Tay. The Tay bridge is recognised as being the best and bridge of its kind, It is not a patch on the fourth bridge as far as engineering is concerned, but I think it is much longer. The height above sea level is not more than 60 feet in any place.\n\nI continued to stay in London till the","138":" While in London I stayed at Putney which is a suburb just outside the city proper, although the postal address is London S.W.7.

Cousin Frank and Tom came to the station to meet me.\n\nI stayed at Pleasley with Uncle & Auntie until the end of my leave which finished on the end of the month, During my stay there I went to Ilkestone to see Uncle Walter and family. I also went to Nottingham to see Cousin Ethel, and on one day I went together with Uncle Auntie and two or three others to Ripley to see the birthplace of Dad. Everything connected with Dads early days in England was shown and explained to me by Uncle, While at Ripley I visited Mr Robert Walker an old friend of Dad’s. I went to Newhoften to see old Mrs White who writes very regularly\n","141":" &","142":"\n\nto Alma and was at one time Grandfathers housekeeper.

I left Pleasley vale with the intention of visiting Etta’s people at Reading but on arrival in London I found that I had no time owing to my having overlooked the hour of the expiration of my pass.

I caught the train at Paddington Station and arrived at Camp at about 4.30pm on the 30th.\n\nToday Tuesday February the","144":" I went to the town of Warminster and had a good look around the place, I am expecting to leave here in a week or two enroute for home.

If all goes well I should be home by Easter.\n\nHere in Camp the rules and routine is not nearly as strict as it was when the war was on. I have no drill to do, I occupy myself by doing odd jobs around the camp.\n\nSince my arrival at camp I have been in constant receipt of letters, both from here and Australia.\n\n17-2-19 The weather for the past two weeks has been very cold with one or two very wet days.\n\nI am at present at No 5 Camp at Sutton-Veny about three miles from the town of Warminster.\n","146":" Yesterday we had as much as 30 degrees of Frost according to the papers, Today it is raining and is still\n","147":"\n\nvery cold. The Influenza is going about a lot again, The men are dying very fast from it in the camp.\n\nAround the camp there is a lot of Sandbagging being done, Only the other night one man was knocked down and killed and robbed, while he was walking home from Warminster to the Camp. It is not safe to be out of camp alone after dark. \n\nTwo men were caught red handed the other night.\n\nThese last two days I have had a cold on the head and chest, If the wether does not get warmer I do not know how I am to get rid of it.\n\n19th of March 1919\n\nOn Tuesday the 18th of February I was taken very ill just after I had finished dinner, I turned into bed straight away, But as the afternoon wore on I got worse, so I decided to send for the Doctor,\n\nFebruary\n\nThe Doctor was sent for and he sent an Army-Medical-Corps-Corporal down to see me and take my temperature, which he did, My temperature was 103.4 degrees.\n\nSoon after he went away, I had a violent fit of vomiting which made me very weak and much worse, It also made my head ache very badly. I continued to stay in bed and wrapped myself up to keep me as warm as possible and prevent myself from shivering so much, but it was no use, The warmer I got the more I seemed to shiver. As near as I can recollect it was about 5.30 pm when the Ambulance came to the hut for me. I was taken first to the “Group Hospital\" at Sutton-Veny, But they would not admit me, owning to my temperature being too high. I was kept waiting in the Ambulance for about 10 minutes, when the\n\nGrounds of Sutton-Veny\n\nMilitary Hospital in March 1919\n\nReading from left to right the people are\n\nC.S.M Wickham, Private Pilmore, Sister Low, Private Duncan, The Ward orderly, & myself.\n","148":"\n\ndriver returned and started on the journey to the next hospital, He had not moved the car many yards when he became bogged somehow, and was trying for someone to get clear without avail, When judging by the number of voices I heard outside the car, he had managed to get some assistance either from the hospital or passers bye, with their aid he eventually get clear of the difficulty after a delay of about 16 minutes, We then proceeded on our journey at rather a fast rate, judging by the way the ambulance swayed about. On arrival at hospital which was the First Australian General at Sutton Veny, I was taken from the Ambulance & carried to the receiving room, where they took all my particulars and then carried me through about 300 yards of Corridors to the Influenza ward No 16. where I was bathed, put to bed with hot water\n\nbottles and a good dose of medicine. I had rather a bad night, my head was aching very much and I was unable to get warm, the amount of vomiting I did, did not tend to improve my head any.

The journey was a very pleasant one, and lasted from 11am to 3pm with a wait of one hour at Westburry junction for the train.\n\nFrom Weymouth Station I had another ride in the Ambulance to the Camp. The camp is situated at Westham which lies just outside the town of Weymouth. On arrival at the Camp I went before the Doctor to be examined and afterwards was allotted to my hut, The Huts here are all fitted with spring beds and is the best Camp the Australians have in the United Kingdom.\n","172":"\n\nOn Tuesday April the","173":" I went before the Doctor again, He sounded my chest and gave me a thorough examination all over and altered my classification from B.2.B to B.1.B.

It is a very large town and also kept very clean. In one part it is not too nice, that is the end where all the shipping comes in. A line of steamers trade between Weymouth and Jersey.\n\nThe ocean beach runs right along the edge of the town, it is about two miles long, but only\n\none part of it which is about 400 yards long is fit for bathing as the rest of the beach is all shingles.\n\nThere is no surf whatever, the water is very smooth when there is no wind blowing it’s almost as smooth as glass.\n\nThey have a nice promenade which follows the beach almost all round, It will be very nice to come down here of an evening. I will get some views of the prettiest places for a souvenir.\n\nI also visited Portland harbour which is next to Weymouth but not as pretty, Portland harbour has a large breakwater built across the entrance to break the force of the rough seas, and make it a safe anchorage for the Men-o-war.\n\nAt night I went to what is called the stiff’s opera, but is in reality the Y.M.C.A free picture show.\n","175":"\n\nOn Friday it was very cold and wet and toward evening it came over very foggy, but in spite of that I went to Weymouth for a walk along the Promenade, I did not stay long the cold soon drove me back to Camp.\n\nOn Sunday the","176":" Two other chaps and myself hired a rowing boat, and went out for a row, It was lovely and smooth when we left shore, but after we had been out about an hour it started to cut up very rough, we were about three miles from shore when we turned to come back, We had a very hard struggle to get back to calm water, The waves and spray were splashing all over us and was also coming into the boat.

It also had a distant view of the big Convict Prison at Portland, here again I could not get much of what it was like it being on the opposite side of the harbour to me, What bit of it I could see was very imposing, it is situated on a very high cliff three sides of which run down to the water edge, Just a narrow strip of sandy country joins it on to the mainland.\n","179":" the","180":" I again hired a rowing boat with two other chaps and went\n","181":"\n\nout on the water for a couple of hours, The water was very smooth which made rowing a pleasure.

The various townships along the coast were quite distinct to the naked eye. \n","193":"\n\nAt 6.30 in the morning we came abreast of the Gibralta rock, The rock stands out a good distance from the mainland and is connected to it by a very narrow stretch of land, It is honeycombed with gun pits and is a very strong fortress, it commands the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.

According to the Ship’s Log, we have travelled 2,500 miles\n","195":"\n\nsince we lefty Liverpool. It has been blowing hard all day and is very uncomfortable on deck although the wind is not cold or the sea rough.\n\nIt is very hard to secure a sheltered spot on deck to sit and read in, owing chiefly to the smallness of the ship for the large number of troops that are on her.\n\nThe weather continued to be nice and warm for the rest of the journey to Port-Said. We arrived at Port-Said on the afternoon of Thursday the","196":" and anchored inside the harbour. As we entered the harbour we saw four French warships and one English, which were anchored just inside the entrance. They are a very old class of ship.\n\nWe are not allowed to go ashore here, so I cannot say what the port is like, But what I can see of the town from the water \n","197":"\n\nlooks very nice, There are plenty of soldiers on shore mostly Lighthorsemen.\n\nThere is two other troopships in harbour as well as us, They have imperial troops aboard and I believe that they are going to England.\n\nIn the evening we were besieged with native boats full of the natives selling all sorts of silks and other wares. They ask you enormous prices for things that are worth only a few shillings, and if you are fool enough to pay it you can. You can generally manage to beat them down a lot, for instance if they ask you 30\/- for a length of Silk you can run them down and finally purchase it from them for about 5\/-. We are going to take one or two Light horse Officers on board from here. At 5.30pm after we had finished taking on all the fresh water that was wanted to last us till our next port of call\n","198":"\n\nwe weighed anchor and proceeded on our way. At the entrance to the Suez Canal there are two wrecks with their masts just visible above water. One of them was sunk in 1916 by the enemy.\n\nThey suspect that wen enemy agent got on board somehow and placed a time bomb down below, that was timed to blow up when the ship was in the Suez-Canal and so block the canal to shipping, But evidently they did not succeed because both ships are quite clear of the entrance, and to all appearances, look as if they were lying at anchor when they sank. At 6pm we left Port-Said and entered into the Suez-Canal.\n\nWe kept going through the canal all night, A searchlight was used to light the way so that we would not run on the\n","199":"\n\nbank, The canal is very narrow and it would not be more than 100 yards wide at any part, It would be non exertion to throw a stone to the land from the ship. At 5am on Saturday morning we reached lake-bitter which is the largest of the three lakes that are along the canal, We anchored here for an hour to let two ships that were coming in an opposite direction through the canal to pass us. Lake Bitter is about 15 miles across at the widest point and is in places very shallow. We left the lake again at 8am and proceeded on our way through the canal to Port-Suez arriving there at about 12 noon and anchored just off from the town. At 2pm we weighed anchor and again started on our way, At nightfall we \n","200":"\n\nhad left Suez far behind, were in the Gulf of Suez with the land quite close on both sides of the ship.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a wonderful piece of work and I should think that it would not be any more than 100 yards wide from bank to bank, 50 ft deep and 90 miles long. From Port Said a road and railway line follow the right bank for a very long distance.\n\nOn the Egyptian side at intervals of from 5 to 10 miles there are signal stations which communicate the prevailing weather conditions on the Oceans, to the ships as they pass.\n\nAt Port Said there is a statute of the Frenchman (De Lesseps\") who constructed the canal. that for every yard of the 90 miles of Canal, one life was lost in construction. De Lesseps who was so successful \n","201":"\n","202":"\n","203":"\n\nin constructing this canal, attempted to cut the Panama-Canal through but failed, went bankrupt and died a pauper.\n\nThe speed at which ships are allowed to travel through the Canal is not to exceed five knots per hour. I was unable to see much of what existed along the banks of the canal, owing to it being dark when we passed through the grater part of it.\n\nAlong the Arabian side there are military camps for a long distance, The Australian Light Horse are in the majority.\n\nAfter passing Lake Bitter I saw a lot of trenches and barbed wire entanglements along both banks, which were put there to form defence works to protect Suez Township and canal from enemy attack. The majority of the country on both banks is flat desert land with a fertile spot visible every now and again. I cannot say what Suez township would be like if inspected closely I could not form any idea by\n","204":"\n\nwhat I could see of it from the steamer, although it looks to be a very clean place.\n\nSoldiers seem to be in the majority here also. Kakhi can be seen everywhere you look. Camps and Military hospitals surround the town, There is also a lot of trees in the place and vegetation seems to flourish here quite well, It is not like the desert a few miles away where you can look for miles with scarcely a sign of any vegetation visible nothing but sand and sand.\n\nIt has been boiling hot all day and I have found it impossible to find a cool spot on the whole ship. Awnings are spread above the decks to protect us from the direct rays of the sun but even underneath these the heat makes the tar blister and boil from between the planks of the decks. Flying fish and Porpoises have been about the ship in very large numbers today. I amuse myself\n","205":"\n\nwatching these fish and smoking.\n\nIn the Red Sea","206":"\n\nTowards noon we passed a large group of Islands about 12 in number. They are called the 12 apostles and are situated very close to the entrance of the Red-Sea and are in one of the hottest parts of the world.\n\nAt 7pm we passed out of the Red-Sea through the entrance which is called Hell’s Gates into the Gulf of Aden. These last few days it has been dreadfully hot, the hottest that I have ever felt before, It has been impossible to keep cool, The sweat has been pouring out of me wholesale.\n\nI think that the entrance to the Red-Sea has been very appropriately named when they named it the Hell’s-gates. In my opinion Hell itself could not be any hotter.\n\nSharks and Porpoises have been about the ship almost all day, And\n\nMay\n\nto-night the Phosphorus has been very prevalent in the water. The last few night the southern cross was to be seen very low down on the horizon in a Southerly direction. \n\nOn Friday the","207":" we were well out in the Indian Ocean, The sea is very choppy and a lot of the men have been seasick, I am alright myself but there is a lot more men on board, that look as if it would be a great relief to them if they could only be sick.\n\nWe have kept land in sight from early morning until afternoon. The land was the North-east coast of Africa and it was on our Starboard side.\n\nAt about three Pm we passed a small island on our Port side.\n\nFlying fish have been about in large numbers, we have passed through shoals of them. Porpoises also have been constantly ahead of the ship.\n","208":"\n\nThe weather has cooled off considerably now, so I am taking to open air treatment of sleeping out on deck, If the weather continues to keep fine I will be nice and comfortable, or if we run into a Storm or it comes on to rain I will get wet, because I am right up on the Forecastle-Deck in the nose of the boat. It is much cooler up on deck than it is down below also the air is much more fresh.\n\nThe Ship is getting very light now and has risen 5 ft higher out of the water than when we left Liverpool.\n\nAt Liverpool the ship was drawing 29 feet of water, now she is only drawing 24feet. This is caused by the large amount of coal and water we have used since we left, The slight sea that is now running is quite enough to make her pitch and roll about a good deal.\n","209":"\n","210":" Yesterday we ran into a fairly heavy sea which made the Ship pitch about so much that it was necessary for the Captain to pump some water into the Fore-Castle well deck for ballast, After the tanks had been fill the ship rode much smoother. At night we had some rain which washed me out of my comfortable position on deck and forced me to go below again, It was very hot between decks and I could not get to sleep until after midnight.\n\n The Phosphorus was more noticeable last night than ever before, probably it was due to the heavy atmosphere and stormy water.\n\nTo-day it is raining hard on deck but the sea has not such a heavy swell as yesterday, I am going to write to Etta and to England to-night and post them when I reach\n","211":"\n","212":" May the","213":"\n\nThese last few days we have had some rather severe Monsoon weather, The sea has been very rough and the rain has been frequently very sharp and heavy.\n\nThis morning we entered the harbour of Colombo and 11am. The Cruiser Sydney and Supply ship Platypus, with four of the surrendered submarines were in the harbour when we arrived. No sooner had we anchored, than we were besieged by native bumboats. These craft are very pecular, they have an outrigger attachment secured to one side to protect them from capsizing, while the boat proper, consists of a portion of a tree trunk hollowed out, with just enough room for one native and a box or two of silks or imitation jewelry.\n\nThe occupants of these canoes offer\n\nMay\n\nyou silks, curios, fruit and imitation jewelry at enormous prices, usually five times their real value, and conclude with taking one quarter of his original offer, with an air of injured innocence.\n\nThe harbour is formed of three breakwaters, enclosing an area of, I should think, about 1,000 acres.\n\nIn rough weather the waves break and reach to a height of 40 to 100 ft above these walls. When we entered the water was not very rough outside, but the waves were then breaking fully 40 ft above the walls. The land looks very pleasant when viewed from the water. The lovely green of the vegetation is much more pleasant to look upon than the barren and parched shores of Port-Said and Suez:\n\nWe were allowed on shore form 2pm till 6pm and I had a good look round the Fort which this portion of Colombo\n\nMay\n\nis called. I visited the Gordon Gardens in Queens Street, and saw the Legislative Council Chambers and other Government buildings which are situated almost Opposite the Gardens. I also saw Queens house which is the residence of the Govenor of the Colony, it adjoins the Gordon Gardens.\n\nAnother interesting structure is the Colombo Lighthouse which is situated at the corner of Chatham St and Queen Street, It is unlike most Lighthouses, this one being in the form of a square tower, It also serves the purpose of a clock tower there being a clock fixed about halfway up.\n\nAnybody passing by, that had not seen the lantern alight, would never dream that it was a lighthouse, It seems very strange that a lighthouse should be situated almost in the centre of town. The streets of Colombo are fairly wide and are kept very clean, The houses for\n\nMay\n\nthe most part are very old and are limited to one floor, They are chiefly occupied by natives, who trade in curios, jewellry & provisions. The majority of the larger places are big British merchant’s offices, and Business places.\n\nThe mode of travelling in Colombo is chiefly by Rickshaw or Motor. In places they have the Electric trams running, but they are not often patronised by the European.\n\nOne thing I noticed here was the absence of Europeans in the streets, There seem top be very few British about at all. Although the signs and newspapers are mostly in English. We are to allowed on shore again to-morrow, so I shall be able to have another look round, and if possible get a souvinir or two to take home with me. The following day Friday I again went on \n","214":"\n\nshore was unable to see round more of the town because I was due back on board at 2pm. I was also unable to go into the native quarters, there being guards posted on all the main thoroughfares into the suburbs to prevent us from going into them.\n\nI would have liked to go into the suburbs, because I believe it to be the prettiest place of Colombo, also I should think it would be a better place to see native life than in the city.\n\nBefore I left for the ship, I purchased a couple of native ornaments for a Souvinir. We left Harbour at 7pm and ran straight into rough windy weather, with a voyage of from 10 to 14 days to Freemantle W.A.\n\nThe lights of Colombo had vanished from sight before I turned in.\n\nOn the 31st of the month we were well out in the Indian Ocean and out of sight of land. The sea is smooth.\n","215":"\n\n"}}
