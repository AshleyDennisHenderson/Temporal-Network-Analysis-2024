Two had to get on some of the camels & only pack saddles on them. Bob Carlyle shared my camel, he occupied the rear sharp nob of the saddle. Crossing Pontoon bridge over canal one of the pontoons were very rocky & camels doing the feet sliding act. Ours threatening to slip side-ways on, several times. However we managed it. Although very sore from the saddle, we had fun on the way out, the camels showing a strong objection to anything in the shape of a motor-car, bike etc. Had trotting competitions, we being handicapped by sharp edges etc but we lobbed or jig jogged home first. Arrived at the Otago M.R. camp about 6.15 pm & there unloaded & camped. Number of Tommy Engrs there.

We also had saddles packed with our blankets etc therefore we were fairly comfortable altho mighty glad to get to our destination. An escort of NZ. M.R. accompanied us. The first part of journey & nearly all the way out to Railhead \nway\n was good going. Camels walking fair pace. Country or desert was hard & a kind of short salt bushy growth on it. In places we crossed the beds of dry lakes or swamps. Towards Railhead (15 m from Kantara) the desert got sandy & heavier travelling. Had dinner (usual bully etc) at Railhead, stopping about an hour. Canterbury M.R. camped at Rlhd \nTravellin\n During morning, escort sighted 5 horsemen & four of them set off full tilt to see who they were. Turned out to be the 5th L.H patrol\n\n Romani\n\n28th – 5th L.H. being camped at Bir-el-Duidah. Passed several empty Bedouin camps or villages. They were built of palm leaves. Small Oasis’ seemed fairly plentiful towards latter end of journey. Canterbury Lt lost his bearings & got a little bushed. However we eventually landed at Romani which is between 30 & 40 miles east from Kantara & Quatia or Qatia several miles S.E. of us. We are about 5 m from sea & Quatia about 7 m from sea. Large dry swamp ‘tween Q & sea. Water covered during wet season. Arrived at Romani ‘tween 5.30 & 6 pm. very glad to get off the camel.\n\n29th – Roused at 4 A.M. to \"Stand to Arms\". Brought Anzac memories back again. After roll-call we set to work pitching hsptl tents etc. About 7.30 am British aeroplane flying very low passed over camp dropping a message. Lowest we have seen. Message acknowledged\n\nApril 1916\n\n Saty\n\n29th – by forming a ring of camels ten being minimum nr. Learnt of recent happenings from Rev. M. Woods & also the other \nWowser\n Cong. Parson. Reports conflicting on certain points. Appears that last Saty (22nd) & Sunday, a well armed managed equipped force of Turks made a swoop on the British (Gloucester) Yeomanry. Yeomanry Patrols had evidently been slack & they were taken by surprise & practically wiped out. 1350 killed wounded & missing. Circumstances & indications point to the Turks having made a swoop down on Gloucesters surrounding them. Yeomanry evidently made splendid fight (all reports agree on that) but were vastly outnumbered & probably out officered & at Quatia Lord Elcoate being surrounded, told his men that he intended to surrender & if any of them wanted to make a bid to escape they were at liberty to do so. 18 tried, 13 got through 5 killed. At Duidar 70 dead Turks & 20 dead Tommies were\n\n Saty\n\n29th – buried. 5th just missed Duidar by an hour. They captured a number of stragglers & also parts of an M.G. They pursued Turks for about 6 m. Some reports say that Turks are only 12 m away & others say they are back at Elarish or Elharisch or some such name which is their base. No of Bedouins being rounded up daily & as prisoners of war are being sent to Kantara. Turks evidently had made reconnaissances & knew all detail as simultaneous attacks made at several points. At Bir-el-Duidar, R.S.M Randall (Camel T’port Corps) said, Turks got to within 12 yards of Tommies surrounding them, 800 Turks to 104 Tommies. Also Worcesters annihilated. Congregational padre said he heard that some* of the Gloucesters were sent for, \n message saying \"we are hard pressed\" & some patrol came \nsaid\n came in \n\n* (Later heard only 26)\n\nApril 1916\n\n Saty\n\n29th – saying, \"The Turks will be here in half an hour\" & they all cleared for Kantara, leaving their comrades to be annihilated. 5th L.H. captured a German Officer on 23rd or day of scrap. Egyptian Papers press bureau reports state that British victory over Turks on 23rd. That 70 dead Turks were buried & wounded & a few prisoners brought in. Also stated that a LH Regt had been called up to reinforce. Understand British Gen’l & staff escaped leaving beer, whisky & lots of stuff of their officers mess behind. Our chaps collared it. Later after Turks had cleared out, & the Staff returned, they sent over for their whisky etc & they got the reply that ‘it was wanted for the wounded whom they cleared out & left.’ Wounded were very sore over being deserted. Makes one’s blood boil to think of such crass incompetency & neglect costing\n\n29th – so many brave lives & the heads escaping. Turks were humane & left water beside the wounded but those devils of Bedouins were like scavengers after an army, they took all food & water that had been left & in many cases killed the wounded & according to the parson the features of many of the dead were mutilated beyond recognition. Believe in course of a couple of weeks the Anzac mtd division will all be here & our artillery supporting, we will advance clearing the Bedouins & Turks out of Elarisch & district & we may eventually land near or in Palestine. Turks had artillery supports, our men had not. Even now we are greatly inferior in numbers etc to Turks. They seem to have a very healthy respect for Austns.

I’m inclined to doubt their statements. Seem fishy. Looks a put up job. Believe Brig. giving them great kidstakes.

Evening of 3rd our men came in whistling & singing so as to\n\n3rd to 12th - \nTurkish attack on Romani etc \n give the Turks a lead into a trap. 1st L.H.B. as usual, relieving them. Shortly after m’dn’t the Turks began the attack with rifle fire & about 1.30 am. the Bde Major roused us to stand to horses ready to move out at a moments notice. Desultory firing till day break when rifle fire increased & their shell fire started. About half a dozen taubes or hostile planes bombed camps & tried to get the artillery as it was moving out. Not successful. Artillery not far from us & Turks mtn battys tried to get it. Also tried to get L.H. column as it passed our camps. Shell bursting a few yards passed our camp & had they burst a few yards shorter would have got over 100 wounded etc & all staff as their target. Our men moved out at daylight & were greeted with shrapnel, Bob Macdonald being the only man hit & he slightly. Wnded came in early & fast. Bombs dropped all round us. About ten A.M. firing eased & their attacks ceased. Our men attacked & drove them back in afternoon, cutting their front & getting in a flank move. Hundreds surrendered. All thro’ night a big gun probably 6\" howitzer firing on railhead & at a hod about 150 yds distant. About every half hour she would put in about half a dozen rounds. Two operating tables going hard all day. Difficulty in getting w’nded away by train so that were left on our hands. Worked till daylight began to peep then half an hour’s snooze & up & at ‘em again.

Couple of Turkish field ambulances captured & one was attached to us treated Turkish wounded.\n\nBattle of Romani","570":" – 13th – About 125 Turks treated. They were given Dental tent & three or four bell tents for their winged. All thro day of attack & night following spent bullets by hundreds fell in & around tents. Two wounded, hit by them, flesh wounds only. One fell in doorway of same & some passed thro tents. Tipped \nsomebody\n one of us to be hit by them but our luck was in. One of our men, Hollege killed by one & Blyth slight wound in back. Fairly spent. Hollege hit on back of head & killed instantly. Turks had retreated thro night & all rifle fire ceased for a time. About 7 pm, Turks given a table in our tent & \ncarried on.\n Rather unique spectacle. We (Austns) treating ours on one table & Turks treating theirs on another table in same tent. Would like to have got a photo but too busy. Turks had retired on Qatia & our L.H & NZs kept in touch.

M.O. died & his sgt to this date (13th) not expected to live. M.O. had compnd, complicated, comminuted fractures of both legs & shock. His foot also badly knocked about below ankle, by piece out of left calf & several M.G. furrows thro buttock. Despite these injuries, poor beggar had to ride from Qatia (6 miles) on horseback.

About seven field guns (mtn bty type) & ammunition captured & 15 – 20 Machine Guns & thousands of rifles. From 1 AM on 4th till about ten pm on 6th we got about one hours sleep.

Both artillery & rifle amm. gave out in afternoon & our bds (1st & 2nd) had to retire a little. Turks shelled our positions very heavily using H.E. & shrapnel. Effect of H.E.’s , slight due to sand. One lobbed in among our bearers horses killing a few, wounding others. Marv. Escapes of our men, none getting hit. Horses reptly hit. We just got wnded away before Turks came up.

Fighting all day 9th & at 5pm position was rushed & Turks & Germans surrendered, about 1700 in all including about 250 Germans (?) About 600 Turks killed & wounded & our casualties about 500, 100 (?) being killed. Sgts Cowley & Barnes 2nd L.H.R. killed Knew Barnes fairly well. Was with Scott on Gallipoli & was unwounded.

Lads said the N.Zs again did good work & Yeom fought this time\n\n4\/14th – German officers when captured very proud & tried to be domineering. One got a devil of a shock. When the led horses or held horses were brought up he said \"Oh this is my horse\" & proceeded to put his foot in the stirrup when the owner of the horse placed such a hefty kick on his behind that he wondered what had struck him. They were also very indignant when their wounded officers had to travel with their men. Of course they got a lot of satisfaction, they always do. Played the usual game, fired on our men till they were only ten yards off & then threw up their hands & would not face the steel. The men say, that next time, there \"aint going to be no throwing up of hands\" but the bayonet will be used. About 4000 Turks were coming \ncame\n to the relief of the others when two sqdns of the 8th\n\nJany 1917\n\n4th\/14 – L.H. held them up. Directly they came in touch the 4000 \"dug in\" & entrenched. They reckon if they had had another reg’t to get round them they would have surrendered, such is their morale. Shows what ours \nis\n. Report says that when the German officer got his behind kicked, a Turk rushed up & offered to cut his throat. Report also says that the German’s oppression of the Turks, makes them so willing to surrender. Subm. Busy off Port Said, Russian T.B. torpedoed & the \"Ben McCrae\" \naeroplane\n sea-plane ship also torpedoed off El Arish. The \"Ivernia\" a Cunard Liner of 14 000 tons, a transport sunk in Mediterranean about 170 troops missing. Sgt Sim overdue his leave. Some speculation as to whether he was aboard.
