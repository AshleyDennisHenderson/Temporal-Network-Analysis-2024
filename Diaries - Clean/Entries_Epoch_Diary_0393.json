Shorpshire at 5 o’clock p.m., arrived at Melbourne Friday 2 o’clock p.m.","2":" We took 200 troops on board at 1.30","3":" March, nothing unusual occurred on that trip. I did not get a chance to go ashore at Melbourne so I cannott tell you much about it Except that it takes the boat about 4 hrs. from the heads to port Melbourne, we laid out in the stream & the transport boat carried the Melbourne boys on board.\n","4":"\n\nWe left Melbourne at 6.45 on 21st after a verry cold visit. Rumours were numerous, some say that there was something wrong with the propeller but afterwards found out to be untrue. At Melb. we took aboard 8 nurses, They being the only women folk aboard, we now have 18 Sgts. in our mess, previous to that we only had 12. After leaving Port Melbourne we struck the heads 3 hrs. after leaving Port Melb. I am told it is called the (Rip) it is a glorious sight, one mass of whirlpools & verry rough, we lost sight of land about 8 p.m. 21st March on the way to Albany which I believe is our next Call.\n","5":"\n\nThere is no land in sight, we are now in the Great Australian Bight, it is beginning to get Rough some say that we will have a storm to night. One poor unfortunate individual slipped on deck & broke his arm so I was told off to get a party of 12 men to holy stone the decks. We have only lost 1 horse since we started.\n","6":"\n\nWe are getting it verry Rough now the wind is travelling about 60 miles an hour. Our boat is taking it verry good. There is land in sight so we watch the small mountains on the sea for a change.\n","7":"\n\nHaven’t much news to day feeling too sick we had a storm last night so that done the trick. No sight of land yet this 7.30 a.m. Thursday. Ha Ha Land sighted at 2.30 great Rejoicing on board the ship every one is cheering after a verry quiet voyage from Melbourne it was quite a novelty to see land on the starboard side on the Port side a P & O boat passed us, the first boat to pass us on the voyage from Melbourne. it is rumored on board this ship that America has declared war on England. We will lose sight of Land about 9 p.m. tonight, the last we will see for about 10 days.\n","8":"\n\nWell we have lost sight of land again 9 a.m. the ship is rolling now instead of pitching which has given me a chance to get on my feet again. I feel well this morning by good luck as I am ships orderly Sgt that means a busy day. I might tell you that the ships ord. Sgt. is the Senior N.C.O. of the day so you can see that a man wants to feel well on that particular day. I have a nasty Cold just at present but I got the Steward to get me a hot lemon drink & I feel much better this Morning. We have not Called at any port since we left Melb. Colombo is our next Port of Call that is ten days trip out of sight of land.\n","9":"\n\nWell we are just about to reach Colombo we have had a splendid trip from Cape Lewin.\n\nThe ocean is about as smooth as I have ever seen in fact so one of the Men I have spoken to say they have never seen the Indian Ocean so smooth before yesterday it was just like a sheet of Ice. It does ones eyes good to watch the sunsets & Moonrises, it is some think beautiful a sight you might never see again. Last night we had a grand Concert on the Promenarde which was verry nice considering the wind was against the singers. All the boys lined up on the hatch way, some of them were in verry good positions & some were in bad ones. It was a grand sight to see the boys respond to the National Anthem by standing to (Attention) then we gave three cheers and that finished the night. At 6.30 this Morning I was looking over the railing of the ship all of a sudden there was one mass of flying fish dart out of the water & fly about 25 yards, not only one lot but several lots were seen. It is called a shoal when there are a lot together. I have ommitted to note that we passed Cocos Islands on last","10":" We were out too far to see anything much of the Islands. Some say were about fourteen miles out so you can guess what chance we had of seeing them. To day is Sunday, there will be a church service on deck which will be much better than down below where we often have it.\n","11":" ","12":"\n 5th April\n\nWell we have reached Colombo at last. We were waiting about outside the breakwater for about 3 hrs. really speaking we anchored in the harbour about 8 o’clock, it is not a bad place from the boat, I have not been off the boat yet. When we were tying up there was one mass of cooleys in Small boats rushed the Gang ways to get on the boat to sell small goods all of them producing their cards but only a few were\n\nallowed to board the ship. We took in coal & water. The cooleys are great in selling all sorts of things, bananas, cigars, Indian money, coconuts, underclothing. Some of the niggers are great at diving for money, cunning that Cunning they won’t dive for \nmoney\n Copper only silver. We left Colombo at 8 p.m. on the","13":" our stay Consisted of 12 hrs. Noone was allowed to to go ashore so everybody is at this present moment \nis\n verry dissappointed. we finished up at Colombo by singing Patriotic Chorusus. I must say that Colombo is a verry pretty little harbour what little we seen of it. As we were moving out two powerful searchlights played on us. Coming out of the harbour the break water is something like this --- and the boats go in & out these two gates with lights on the end of the wall.\n\nMarch\n","14":"\n\nWe are now passing the furtherest point of India that is near Celon, there is one mass of fishing Dhows or smacks sailing about our boat that is about 10 miles out from land but it is verry Calm hardly a move in our ship as far as the rolling or pitching is concerned. we sighted this land at 8.45 this morning, this land is about the highest we have seen, they look like huge mountains, there is a haze about so that makes it harder to see the land. Well there is no land in Sight now that 9.45","15":"\n","16":"\n\nI was given a St. Johns testament to night by the Chaplin. We are in the Arabian Sea now but it is just as Calm as the Indian Ocean.\n","17":"\n\nWe passed the Socotro Island this morning a 6 oclock, we were too far out to see much.\n","18":"\n\nReached Aden at 7 oclock, it was a verry pretty sight to see each light as it came over the horizon as we moved on search lights were seen about \n\nhalf a dozen, I must say that it was a glorious sight. I was up on the rigging forward & could see pretty well everything as we neared the serchlights the pilot came aboard, they were brought over to us in a small boat manned by Arabs.\n","19":"\n\nWe left Aden last Night at about Midnight staying for a couple of hrs. it is now 7 oclock, on our starboard side we are passing the 12 Apostles Islands in the red sea, there is quite a lot of Islands where we are now. we are now passing the Orange River boat.\n","20":"\n\nAfter the hot weather we have quite a cold change just like a winters morn, we are just about to enter the Suez Canal, it is now 5-30. The water is verry pretty Color near the Seuz, it was not so hot as I expected in the red Sea. Well we are landing at Seuz instead of Going through the Canal, we arrived at the wharf at 8 oclock and disembarked at 11 oclock that night. after seeing all the horses off the boat we were packed into the horse boxes as we called them & arrived at Cairo at 6 a.m. in the morning 6½ hrs. journey cramped up. We disembarked & marched off to the Camp, we have now settled down for active service much regretting the good times on board ship such as the food & convenience it was alright. I felt dissappointed at not seeing my brother, it is said that they have gone to the dardenelles.\n","21":"\n\nI am camped at Zeitoun Camp now in the midst of the sand, verry bad for Training. We get plenty of leave so I have been touring around. We are not far from Heliopolos, a beautiful place it is too. there are some of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen especially the Hospital but they are badly placed. Cairo is a verry busy place, every second native you meet has got something to sell you, there are something like 38 thousand prostitutes in Cairo so you can imagine what the place is like with women\n\nevery where you go it is Zig Zag verry nice verry good Australia verry good, come on Australia, nothing but this every where you go. I have visited the sacred well & the sacred Tree in Matareih. Well we expect to go to the front at any minute now may be a week or a fortnight, no longer.\n\nMay 15th Saturday\n\nTomorrow we will have been in Egypt a month. I am getting full up of camping on the Desert, I think everyone else is of the same mind there is one mass of wounded being sent here every day now there is some like a hundred thousand beds in different hospitals along the different suburbs. I have been to several Touring places. The Pyrimids is about the best, they are wonderful no doubt. Whilst I was there I had my photo taken with a group right in front of the Sphinx. I was \ngazeted\n gazetted on the 10th of May as Sergeant, our pay started from 17th of March, on the 14th the rest of our reinforcements arrived, they are 1st & 2nd Batt. that is for the","22":" Reinforcements –","23":" 2nd,","24":" 4th &","25":"\n\n On the","26":" I was put under open arrest for losing a prisoner for 8 hours. I was changing the guard at the Detention Compound & after taking over the prisoners the Sgt. of old Guard & myself walked out of the gate where we were fixing up matters, I noticed a prisoner walk out of the gate with a dixie. well me not nowing my prisoners thought he was one of the orderlys & took \nnot\n no notice of him when at 7 oclock Cpl. of police came to me & said, have you got Pte. Loch in the Boob. I said yes, so I said do you want to see him. Yes. I took him in & of course he was not there that was the first I knew of it so I am waiting my trial. The","27":" will see us moving off to the front to Dardenelles. The cost of Living here is Dearer than Australia to my knowledge. Of course there some things that are decidedly cheaper. There is one thing that the Gyppies cannot do is make butter, it tastes sour to me and all the others say the same. I fill my time up mostly look up the books now & again I go to town & last but not least writing letters.\n","28":"\n\nYesterday we went to the range & fired some 20 rounds. There was no convenience for water there, most of our lips were parched for the want of water. Today I am just about the hardest up I have been in all of my life, in fact this last 4 day I haven’t seen 1 Piastre, anyhow to night we get paid all our back pay, it is about £5 in all, so that will be one consolitation, verry hot to day flies are numerous here worse than Sydney by long half.\n","29":"\n\nLeft Zeitoun Camp at 6.45 Wednesday, reached Alexandria at 3 p.m., we sailed from Alex. at 7.30 that night & reached Lamnos Island at","30":" On our trip we were badly treated, the food & accomodation was verry poor on this ship, that is The S.S. Novian. there was no special mess for sergeants. I think we were worse off than the Men. The Trip from Alex. was verry pleasant, fine weather & a fair amount of scenery such as Islands every five or six miles. The Islands are that Large that a village was pointed out to me & it looked for all the world like one mass of stones white. The height would account for that. Tomorrow we expect to land at Lamnos Island.\n","31":"\n\nWe left the A12 T.T. at 6 oclock p.m. & boarded the “Newmarket\" for Anzac Cove, all the Boys except the","32":" of 4 Rein. went on board the Newmarket.\n","33":"","34":"\n\nWe arrived safely at Anzac Cove near Sara Bair hill and landed in small punts, we expected to be fired on but as luck happened we were not as we reached to beach we were meet one huge hill covered with what is called dug outs, little humpies cut out in the hill which we all live in, each man or two men have one to himself. We all got ashore 110 was the number of my company. I marched\n","35":"\n\nthem up to our position near the firing line which is about a mile from the beach. I handed my men over to the","36":" Battalion Head Quarters where we were split up into A, B, C & D Companys, myself going to D Coy. I was sorry to loose my Company as I had been with them all along ever since I had enlisted. We put up for the night in a dug out which I & two of my Cpls. made. I tell you we were a bit nervous that night, shots flying over our heads as we thought so we did not sleep verry comfortable so we passed the next day a bit better getting used to it. this night we turned in early at 8 oclock, at about 12 o’clock I was aroused to go up into the firing line. I can tell you was shakey, the second night anyhow a party had already been found so we were dismissed not to my sorrow I can assure you. The third day I joined my platoon that is the","37":" as Platoon Commander, we went up to the firing line at 8 a.m. that morning which was not so bad going up in the day, one could see where he was going & how the land lies.\n\nAfter a few days of hell I got quite used to it, every evening we get shelled with shrapnell which is verry dangerous especially out of the trenches & down on the beach where they shell verry often in fact while I am writing this diary there are shells bursting on the beach. we are down near the beach for a spell so I can see them quite plainly. this country is verry mountainous especially when we have to carry up the water in cans from the valley. It is against all rules to have a wash on account of shortage of water, it is nearly a fortnight since I had a wash so I am going down to the beach tomorrow for a swim, this is the only time we can get the swim when we are spelling.\n","38":"\n\nWaterloo day so let us hope that we have as great a success as what Wellington had.\n","39":"\n\nThings are verry quiet just now we had it pretty lively last night, they attacked us at Quinns Post but were repulsed. I have been in supports now about two weeks so things are getting very stale.\n","40":"\n\nReverted to the ranks at Gallipoli, gazetted as Sergeant in Zeitoun May 13, 1915, acting Sgt. from","41":" till","42":"\n","43":"\n\nArrival of Andy Watson into","44":" Battalion. Whilst I was standing on the verandah outside our trenches I caught sight of him & had quiet a long chat together, he looked a bit thin on it but looked well.\n","45":"\n\nCapture of Lone Pine at 5-30 Friday, we left the trenches & took Lone Pine after a fierce & long struggle losing a good many. I got wounded at 4.30","46":" & landed at Alex.","47":" & was admitted into No. 19 General Hosp. Alexandria.\n","48":" sailed for Eng. to finish Convalescence, arrived at Malta","49":"\n\nThence we proceeded to Gibraltar. on our way from Gib. going through the Bay of Biscay we got a wireless from the Highland Warrior to say she had struck the coast of Spain near Cape Finnistare, we arrived at the wreck at 6 a.m.","50":" saving 29 passengers, mostly women. after sailing a day further we picked up a life boat. we arrived at Southhampton on","51":" at 6 a.m., thence we boarded the train at 11 a.m. and arrived at Waterloo at \n11.10\n 1.10 p.m., we had lunch on the train.

We also passed the Star of Australia. We have a fair sports programme on for today so as to remember the Day of our Native Land. We fell in on the boat deck at 10 oclock & was given a list of sports. Most of the Lads who were fairly fit entered their names. 2 oclock started the events, Tug of war won by South Aust. Drawing the Pig (game of bull), Bun & treakle race & a nail driving Competition for the Nurses. In the evening we held a Competition of Comic & sentimental Songs. At 9 oclock the prizes were distributed & we finished up with a speech from the O.C. of the troops so I think we kept up our day fairly well.

We expected to call in at the Cape town but to our dissappointment we did not, I losing a half crown on the deal. We had news via wireless that a great reception was awaiting us if we were coming into port.\n","83":"\n\nToday is my birthday which is celebrated on board in the Indian Ocean.

We are now about seven days sail from Albany, it being our next port of call to drop our west boys. Tonight at 8.00 we droped a life buoy overboard with the latest flare attached to it.

Whilst the west boys were going off we were presented with cigarettes, matches, cakes & chocolate. In the evening we had a fine concert down our troop deck given by ladies of Fremantle. We moved out of port at 9.30 tonight, next stop Melbourne where we alight I think & thence rail to Sydney. My opinion of our west reception was verry quiet indeed, I hardly heard a cheer uttered. I suppose that is due to so many troop ships being in before us that the people are getting tired of it. Some of the lads got ashore although there was an armed guard patrolling the wharf. Needless to say that there was some booze smuggled aboard, pretty well all night we were putting them to bed.\n","87":"\n\nWe are just about to enter the Great Australian Bight. The wind has reached about sixty miles an hour. In reference to our arrival at W.A., I think it was one of the sights of the world to see the beautiful long beaches pure white sand and the evening sun just setting, just like our own dear shores. One soon knows when he is near the native Land. I could not help but take notice of the pure white frocks of the Colonials as compared with the English mufferlers & top Coats, it being winter in England.\n","88":"\n\nPassed King Island about 6.30 enroute from West to Melb.
