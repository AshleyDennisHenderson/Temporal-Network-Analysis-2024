There also are French English & Portuguese soldiers & other varieties – officers of apparently all nationalities & rank. To my way of thinking the best of all are the Australians & Jocks. The Australian nurses are very plain of feature but they are a little bit of \nhome\n. The Welsh band’s mostly \nmusic\n but not very enjoyable.
