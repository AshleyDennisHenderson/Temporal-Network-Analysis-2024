1917\n\nHad no sleep at night of course as everyone wished to express their opinion as to our going away. Marched onto Parade groundat 3.30am, then caught a special train to the City.\n\nA great crowdwere at the station to welcome us, also to see the last possible glimpse of friends. I had several down and we formed a great party walking down in Column of \"mob\". Dad carried my Kit Bag; fortunately a motor car took them shortly after we started so it relieved us all of a job. As soon as we arrived at the wharf we said Goodbye to all our relatives and friends.\n\nEmbarkation rolls were called and every man had turned up. Going on the ship we were give our quarters in the aft part of the ship, which by the way is A.15 and \"Port Sydney\" by name. Leaving our kits down we went on deck to say a final goodbye to our people. I had a fine view of my friends till the ship pulled right out.She anchored off Rushcutters Bay till noon. Numerous launches crowded with people came around the ship. I again saw my people for a good while until the launch went back. An occasional ferry boat gave a a goodbye with the siren. The sea outside is calm. Had a good dinner and\n\nseveral roll-calls etc, until 5pm when we had tea. Everyone went to bed early, and in hammocks. It was fun watching them trying to make themselves comfortable. None however succeeded, buthaving had no sleep the previous night, all very soon were quiet.\n","2":"\n\nUp at 5.30 AM although \"Reveille\" goes at 6AM and rolled our hammocks, putting them in the places set apart for that purpose. Had breakfast at 8AM but many vacant places could be seen. The meals so far are good, and our quarters spacious of course there are a number of men. The troop-deck extends the length of the ship having\n\n\n\n\n\nMess tables on either side, seating fourteen at each. Our equipment is put on the sides of the ship. The troops have the use of the Well-deck, the NCo's the Promenade and Boat deck for the Officers. She is doing about 11 knots an hour. A head sea is making her pitch,consequently many are sick. The wind is very cold. Have kept insight of land most of the time. Have been alllotted to different Boat Stations, I share a raft with nineteen others so everything is right for a bad day. Wrote letters home as we get to Melbourne tomorrow.\n","3":"\n\nReveille at 5:30 AMwhen all had to turn out and then rolled hammocks. The\n\nfresh water is turned on from5.30 to 6.30am, so there was arush for the basins. Shavingoperations could be seen inprogress in every availabledeck space. Had Physicalstunts on Promenade Deckfor half hour then camebreakfast. The rest of themorning was put in sittingon deck. In the afternoon theships Routine Orders wereread out, then a little lecturewas given. The heads cameinsight about 5 P.M. passingthe \"Rif\" at 6 P.M.. The seais very clam and most ofthe men are well again.A Sing-Song was held ondeck, when the O.C. of 31st Reinwas presented with the Flag of his\n\nReinforcements as we are not allowed to take it away to the front. Mr Middleton presented it on behalf of the Reinforcements. We are now making up to Port Melbourne.\n","4":"\n\nArrived Port Melbourne early in the morning when we went up to the Admiralty Wharf. The Kit Bags of the men came down early and were put on board. Leave was given to all from 10am till 11pm much to our surprise. I acted guide to five men who have not been to Melbourne before, and showed them around the city. we went down by train making for the G.P.O when all sent letter etc. Had a great lunch\n\nthen had a walk around the town. finally going to the Church of England writing tent for a rest. From here we went through Coles Book Arcade and up to the Post Office.\n\nHad Dinner in style, finishing up a good day by going to the theatre. Arrived home in good time very tired. Melbourne is the same as a year ago. Still have the old cable trams.\n","5":"\n\nUp as usual 5:30 AM and had the usual wash; these are habits which only occur twice a day. The troop train came down about 8am, troops numbering about eight hundred, composed of field artillery . A.M.C and flying corps, so the ship is\n\nwell packed.. People came down onto the wharf in thousands and made a very pretty scene with the many coloured dresses. The Victorians were given their quarters, then all went up on deck. Streamers kept those parted for a little while together until finally the vessel moved off amid the strain of Pack up your Troubles in you old Kit Bag. It was a pretty sight and very impressive, seeing those of our own nation, giving us, who are leaving for an unknown destination such a hearty farewell. It is a perfect day and lovely streaming along, the sea being very calm. Passed the heads at 4:30 PM. Sat on deck and had a read. The majority are\n\nplaying cards and other games of interest. It is calm outside at sea. Had issue of \"Comfort Funds\" at tea. These little gifts at eatables go well as a break from the other. Being tired from yesterday. I intended turning in early . The Hammocks are that close that it is impossible to fall out. This should be handy when the sea is unsettled.\n","6":"\n\nStill insight of land when Reveille went this morning, the sea is calm, but wind is coming up, which makes it very cold on deck. Had signalling all the morning, & a little boat drill, when the Victorians were allotted to their\n\nstations. The decks are crowded when the men are dismissed & one finds it difficult to a get a good spot of rest. After dinner we had Boat Drill, I guess if the boat did sink, many would perish. Twenty men to one raft is the number, but many more are attached to some. We are now out of sight of land. it is cold on deck. Had a game of draughts then turned in. The majority of men are playing cards or reading\n","7":"\n\nClock went back twenty minutes so had extra sleep. Had usual parade in morning. Passed two large ships about 8AM. Full serivce uniform for church parade, held on the Boat Deck at 10:15AM.\n\nThe service was brief but good, we stood up throught the service. Had Boat Drill in the afternoon again when those unallotted were given their raft number.\n\nIt is very cold on deck, having a head wind. The sea is calm.\n\nPut in Spare time reading and writing. The band rendered some good music in the afternoo. Had a sing song at night, when popular hymns were sung. The sea appears to be coming up; had a little rain.\n","8":"\n\nSea is very rough and the ship is tossing about. Clock went back some twenty minutes again so, we are having plenty of sleep. Have grown used to the\n\nhammock now, and slept well. Had Gun Drill Lecture and signalling in the morning. Had to put our service boots on for the afternoon, as our feet would get soft if we continued to wear our sand-shoes. Had marching on deck for an hour and it went well. The band played. Had Boat Drill again, when everyone obtained their life belt, and reported to their respective stations. It is extremely cold on deck. Wrote a few letters and had a read, then turned in.\n","9":"\n\nSea much calmer today. Had Physical Stunts as usual. From 9:30AM till 11:30AM had lecture on Batteries and angles. Whale passed by close to the ship, we also\n\npassed a dead whale of good size. The birds were there in large numbers having a Xmas feed. Had a good walk around the decks in afternoon with service boots on. The band played. Had Morse signalling till the end of the parade. Had a concert to night by the Victorians, they were very good.\n","10":"\n\nA fresh wind has come up making it very cold. Had Physical Drill as usual as a little shipping. Had lectures till 11:30 AM. Land sighted at 10AM believed to be King Georges Sound so should strike the Cape tonight and Fremantle in a day. Passed two ships. Very strong wind blow-ing making ship roll. A few\n\nwaves came in the Ports also on deck wetting a few of the chaps. Had route march as usual. Down below is favourite tonight, they are just issuing the hammocks for the night. Measles has broke out on board.\n\nThrusday","11":"\n\nUp as usual and did usual Physical Jerks. Am on water Picquet today, a very soft job. Have to guard the fresh water tap. There are three to each place so do one hour on and two off. Passed Cap Leeuwin about Midnight; the ship is now going in a Nor-West direction. Ship is rolling a good deal, there being a following sea. A party had rifle shooting at a target some few hundred yards off representing a submarine.\n\nthe firing was excellent for first time. Had Boat Drill soon after dinner when everyone rushed for belts and went to respective stations. No sooner had we our belts away than it went again. We are gradually getting perfect. The main fault is congestion at the stairways.Had a good read all day, then played drafts at night. An Impromptu Concert was held. Have left Australia making for Colombo. Since leaving Melbourne the only land sighted was King Georges Sound, and that we lost in a couple of hours.\n","12":"\n\nOn water guard early this morning. Have inspection by a Medical Officer every morning owing to Measles breaking out.\n\nHad usual lectures morning and afternoon. Have changed our parade ground to other side of deck. We are to change each week. Had shooting at target in water again. It is much warmer today as we are going Nor Nor West. Sea and wind is still following. Had route march around deck, rather warmer than usual. Our meals are still good. Most men are up on deck tonight as it is much cooler than down between decks.\n","13":"\n\nHad no Physical Stunts today, as we had to get dressed for a full Kit Inspection. This meant a lot of trouble having to take up our Kit Bags, hammocks and Life Belts, besides getting into a full marching order dress.\n\nFell in at 9am and stayed till noon without any signs of an Inspection. After dinner we bought our gear down and packed it away. The temper of all on the Mess Deck is now rather of a higher pitch than usual. Had a Boxing Tournament on Promende Deck. Many good bouts were witnessed by a large number of officers and men. Good positions went very early, late arrivals found seats near the funnel of the ship or on the Bridge. Any place out of bounds is always recognised as the best place. After tea a very good concert was held. It is getting very hot on deck and below. The awnings were put up today . The sea is calm, ship is making good way.\n","14":"\n\nLovely morning sea is calm, sat in the cool till breakfast. Had Egg and Bacon for Breakfast. Egg was not much good. Had a good Divine Service at 10:15AM on the Well Deck for'ard. It is now very hot especially between decks. Wrote letters all the afternoon. also read a little. At night developed a film then sat on deck in the cool. Most of us sit and sleep on deck. A Sing Song was also held tonight.\n","15":"\n\nVery hot in sun. The 31stReinftshad their first washing day Parties of twenty eight men took their turn at doing their washing. Two basins of water was each man's allowance, one to wash in,\n\nthe other to rinse them. Having only twenty minutes, the various articles received little attention, consequently, they didnot appear to have gained much through the process. Our drying took place on the lower portions of the rigging, fastening them by tying the sleeves together. Had usual route march, until the \"Alarm\" went; then the hustle and rush took place, especially getting down the companion way. Have at last donned the Tropical Dress, and allowed to sleep on deck. Wrote letters at night then read a little. More submarine practice took place. We are near Cocos Island, made historical since the war.\n","16":"\n\nSlept on Promenade Deck. Found it rather hard, yet it was lovely and cool. Did Physical Stunts as usual Pay Day; received a small amount. Had letter and route march. A concert was held at night. Wrote letters most of spare time. Rifle practice continued today at Submarine target. Good shots were recorded. Much hotter than yesterday, especially down between deck. Sea calm.\n","17":"\n\nVery cloudy and humid. Rained during the night, causing sleepers on deck to scramble under shelter. Had Physical Stunts, lectures. Heavy rainfall at 11AM when you could not see a hundred yards ahead. Flying fish are numerous in these waters. Had Boat Drill today.\n\nWas half through a shave when the alarm went so had to go up as I was. The interstate \"Tug-o-War took place when Victoria defeated the New South Wales team. Wrote letters, being the last opportunity we have before the closing of the mail for Colombo. Very hot down, below.\n","18":"\n\nDeck sleepers were again awakened in the early hours of the morning by the rain. Had the usual \"Stunts\" After breakfast we did Knotting and Lashing till Dinner. Had afternoon off as the Sports were held. Many different events took place. Sparfighting proved the most interesting, many contests being very funny. The sack race,\n\nPotato Race, and Cock fighting entertained a good crowd; on the whole everyone enjoyed the Sports all events being carried through satisfactorily. It is very hot still. The wind is now head on, so there is a good breeze blowing. The mail closed for Colombo today, so letter writing is over for a few days. I am not sorry.\n","19":"\n\nHad usual Physical Stunts before breakfast. Have changed our parade ground again, we are now on the Starboard Side of the Boat Deck. It is very hot up there as compared to the other deck. Had Signalling and Gun Drill lectures. A cool wind is blowing. The rain still pours down at night, Crossed the line in the afternoon.\n\nThe announcements of tomorrow's ceremony was given from the Bridge.\n","20":"\n\nAll Officers are now engaged in censoring letters, there being over fifteen thousand letters sent in. The Colonel has fixed the next mail at three letters per head. He said the Officers were overworked ? Yetthe Colonel is trying hard to get us leave at Colombo. Had usual lecture this morning. At 11AM we started our \" Route March\" doing several times around the deck. After dinner I wandered up onto the Boat Deck as I thoughtto secure a good position for the \"Neptune Carnival\", but all positions of note were taken. However I worked my way in to\n\nthe front and so had a rather crushed view. Long before \"Father Neptune\" appeared all the deck was crowded, even on the Engine Room places were secured. \"What was that?\" A noise certainly, for the procession headed by a band whose instruments were not in harmony, made its way along the Well Deck to the Promenade Deck. With \"Father Neptune\" walked his Doctor and attendants.\n\nOwing to the large number of men on board who have not been across the line, two \"Sports\" from each Reinforcement represented the unit. One at a time they came onto the platform, where the \"Doctor\" sounded their chest and heart, giving them a pill of soap. Sitting on a chair, back to the bath the Barber's assistant lathered their\n\nface, mouth and eyes particularly. The Barber with a razor more like a scythe shaved their face. They were then rudely pushed into the water and \"Ducked\" by two \"heavy weights\". Several Officers went through the procedure, receiving extra lather and ducking. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon. At the finish the hose was let loose with the result the Colonel orderd the \"Alarm\", thus ended the afternoon Sport.\n\nAt night a very good concert was held on the Promenade Deck. The night was perfect.\n","21":"\n\nHad Divine Service at 10 AM but could not hear the service being too far back. Enjoyed the hymns. It is very hot still.\n\nwrote a few letters in the afternoon. Had Sing Song at night. Expect to get into Port tomorrow. They are drawing to see who is doing duty whilst at port.\n","22":"\n\nArrived in sight of land early in the morning, when we made for the breakwater passing into the harbour about 9:30 AM, and anchored just inside. The Colonel went ashore to try and get us leave as the \"Wireless\" sent asking for same was refused, owing to another lot rioting there on Saturday before. He arranged that five hundred to go ashore at a time, for three hours each. Sixty out of each unit went at 2 PM, four barges taking us to the Town Pier. Forming up we marched through the town.\n\nto the Barracks, where, after a lecture we were dismissed till 5.30 PM only having two hours leave. With a mate we went to the G.P.O. then took a Rickshaw to a firm we knew and did a hurried shopping hour. Bought several souvenirs of Colombo. Taking a Ricksha we went to the YMCA leaving the Parcels to be sent on home. Had a look round the town then made back to the Barracks. The town is the same as I have already described in the other diary. A few fine buildings have been recently built. Electric Trams also run to the Railway Station from the Pier. It is very hot and humid ashore. This is the Monsoonal Period. Took several snaps but the light was bad.\n\nEvery man played the game, all turning up to time Marched down to the Pier. Every man had his hands full, either bananas, Cocoanuts, brass work or numerous oriental curios. The Natives poured out of the shops to see the procession. Came back in four barges taking us about half hour to get back.\n","23":"\n\nVery Hot still. Am on Guard today. Mounted at 7.30 AM, I am on first relief doing from 8AM till noon. Another batch of five hundred went ashore this morning. Had till 1 PM. They returned back at 2 PM. Eighteen men have failed to report. The last batch have just gone. Took several photos from the ship. The tables are laden with Bananas etc. Have finished coaling and watering. They are still taking\n\noff frozen meats, several barges have already gone. The natives' gabble is getting monotonous, they are just in the hold alongside. The third batch have returned. Am on Guard from 8PM till midnight. A terrific Monsoonal storm came up about 5PM, when it poured for two hours, land in close vicinity was obscured. Lightning was vivid while it lasted. The party ashore arrived back at 9 PM very wet and down hearted, with a bad impression of Colombo also. The Singalese continued working all night, making a terrific noise, especially with their gabble, with the result none of the Mess Deck went to sleep. till the late hours of the morning. Finished taking on the tea about 8 AM.\n","24":"\n\nUp early as Icould not sleep. Very humid, the heat is almost a killer. Numerous divers around the ship. calling out \"me di(ve) di(ve)for threepence etc. \"These men are common here. Some are good divers. Had an \"alarm\" at 11 AM and stood by for over an hour. The Boat pulled out at noon, we were not sorry, for it is much cooler at sea, than in port. Had lectures in the afternoon, but these did not go down too well, all being tired. It is calm at sea. Plenty of \"cheap\" cigars are running around the deck in the hands of Gunners. I have fifty so will \"swank\" too. Did a little reading. Sent a few cards off this morning with the Y.M.C.A official. They do great work amongst the troops.\n","25":"\n\nRained very hard all night, so now all have to sleep down on the Mess Deck, which is extremely hot and muggy. The atmosphere is still humid. Had no Physical Culture as it was too wet. After breakfast we had signalling and lectures. In the afternoon we had a few Military Orders read out to us, particularly matters dealing with dealing with A.I.F.in France during operations in the last offensive. It is still hot. The days are short, night falls quickly,the sea is calm. A concert was held on deck. Not bad.\n","26":"\n\nSea very calm. There is no wind consequently the heat is terrific. Had usual lectures during the day. Have changed our parade ground again to the Promenade\n\nDeck aft. It is much cooler down here. Developed several films at night, they all turned out very good, in fact, better than I thought they would. Had an \"Alarm\" soon after the \"Lights Out\" when we were just getting to sleep. it was a \"Dinkum\" pyjamas parade. Some cursed. _________X ?\n","27":"\n\nHad usual \"Physical Stunts\"; sea is calm, although it is raining heavily. We are getting use to the rain waking us up at night, for each night sees us disturbed at some unearthly hour. Had lectures till noon. A chap died of Measles about 9 AM and all on board had to attend the burial at 3 PM. After the service volley were fired and the corpse was put into the sea. \" The Last Post\" was sounded.\n\nDid little reading, then after tea went to the concert which was held on the Promenade Deck. It was not bad.\n","28":"\n\nSea is still very calm. Had usual Divine Service at 10 AM. Could not hear sermon being too far away. Had a read before Dinner, then wrote letters, also entering Snaps up in my book.\n","29":"\n\nStarted Mess Orderly this morning for a week. It is not a bad stunt as you have plenty of time off this means, time to write a few letters. The time goes slowly. Paid today, the huge sum of ten shillings. We brought our universal Kit Bags up today, so had an opportunity of repacking our bags\n\nThe sea is calm, heat is still over the mark. The usual rain storm came down last night.\n","30":"\n\nA fresh breeze sprung up during the night, and it indeed proved a blessing. It is on our side of the ship too. Did Mess Orderly duties, also wrote a few letters. A little swell is on. We are now under strict regulations in respect to smoking on deck. Had a washing day.\n","31":"\n\nIssued with a Cap, Comforter, pair of socks, flannel shirt and handkerchief form the \"War Chest\" Sydney. They are very well made. Some had letters in them.\n\nWednesday 5th December 1917\n\nPassed two Islands near Socotra Is about 8 AM, they sighted the main\n\nland some little time after, keeping insight of it ever since.The coast is barron and precipitous, a few fishing boats are about & on the shore, with the aid of glasses you can see small villages. It is cool, sea calm. Did usual Mess Orderly's job.\n","32":"\n\nLost sight of land about noon. Usual routine of ship went through. There is no news. Expect to strike PerunIsland early in the morning. Our Attestation Papers checked today. Getting ready for disembarkation.\n","33":"\n\nEntered the Red Sea early this morning. British Cruiser stopped us then gave us the \"Proceed-Goodluck\" Kept insight of land for a few hours. The coast is very precipitous\n\nand against the sky of pale Blue was very picturesque, despite the fact that it is barren. Passed many ships during the day, and have just passed a lighthouse on a huge rock. Mess Orderly's job today was a \"stunner\" having to scrub down the side of the ship nearMess tables. A fresh breeze is blowing. Several of us went on top of Hospital and had a \"Bosker\"sing song, raking up all the old songs, at the same time bringing back memories of Sydney and time gone, perhaps such that will never return.\n","34":"\n\nFinished Mess Orderly today. In afternoon went to see finals of Boxing Tournament. A huge crowd was there. Had concert at night better than usual. No land has been\n\nseen today. The sunsets are not bad. Sea is calm. Weather hot in day cold at night.\n","35":"\n\nUsual church service. A good delivery by the chaplain entitled \"Stand Fast\" Had read in afternoon also fixing up my Camera. Passed a couple of vessels before noon. Had \"Birthday Party\" ?on account of Woods who is now twenty. Some spread of (the usual ) with Lemonade and tinned fruits. Three of the Mess have Birthdays this week. Pity we are not on ship longer than Wednesday next. It is cool on deck. There has been several raids on gambling parties on deck this afternoon. A practical joke just happened. Several of out chaps sleeping on\n\ndeck received a few buckets of water over them. they dont know who did it - They are now changing. A sing song was held on deck at night.\n","36":"\n\nPassed a couple of Lighthouses during the day. It is very cold on deck. Had lectures in morning, and in afternoon we cleaned our equipment up, for going ashore. Most of us slept down below, it being too cold on deck. This is our last night in the hammocks.\n","37":"\n\nStowed hammocks and blankets down the hold early this morning, so have to sleep in overcoats tonight. Land is on either side being close to African Coast. Extremely cold on deck.\n\nPassed several vessels. One had\n\ngone aground during the night and was being tugged off by another vessel. Had signalling all the morning , also in afternoon. Have to sleep on floors tonight. Expect to get in about 8 PM, when we disembark in the morning. It is very cold. Had no mess utensils for tea, so had to use our Mess Tins. The chaps are merry, evidently because trip is over, and fresh ports and places to see in near future.\n","38":"\n\nCame into Port Tewfik early in the morning, pulling alongside one of the wharves. The sick were taken off first then the \"Advance Party went off. Went onto parade about 8AM staying there till 10.30 AM. Then formed up on the wharf, leaving our\n\nKit bags behind, a party being detailed to bring them on trucks. Several large vessels are in port. Had a good four miles walk to the camp. Went through Port Tewfik, this place is very dirty, has poor buildings, and streets are narrow. A train connects this place to Suez a distance of about one mile, mostly, a bridge of stone, with the sea on the other side and canal on the other. Had a rest for a few minutes. Took a snap of the chaps sitting down then one of self with four niggers. The chief vehicle of working class is a frail cart very small pulled by a donkey. This animal is used more so than the horse. The latter is used in the \"Garry\"the chief passenger conveyance.The town of Suez is filthy. Streets and buildings alike are dirty. The\n\nhouses are constructed of stone and plaster, half finished, with flat roofs made with rough spars with plaster thrown in between. Years \nware\nwear have made the houses, originally white, very dirty. The \"Gippos\"or perhaps the \"Arabs\" are equally dirty, having a habit of hanging out the windows, and doors. The Railway runs through the town, having a high iron railing, on each side of the lines for protection to public. The gauge is 4\" - 81\/2 \".There are three classes - natives of course travel third. The file of our Army also have that privilege (unfortunately) - the trains are slow. Passed though a couple of suburbs, mostly natives and the same kind of streets etc to the town there are very few buildings in\n\nthe true sense of the word. Little cultivation is to be seen; the soil is mostly sand and pebbles. A Date palm is to be seen now and then. Arrived at the camp about (13) thirteen o'clock. (The system of time keeping here, is different to that of English speaking nations). The time goes from 1 AM till 12 o'clock (noon) then goes up to twenty four oclock, which is midnight. Had our dinner of \"Bully Beef & Biscuits\", after which we were allotted to tents, eight men in each, so we have ample room to sleep. Nearby is an aerial school for advanced pupils; thus, above our heads several planes constantly are flying. None of us need that portion of \"Physical Stunts\" \"Head Raise\" for we walk looking to the sky. This however, will soon wear off, and in time we will not heed them. Had two blankets issued, they are\n\nnot bad. Had tea of bread & \"Bully Beef\"; washed down with China tea. We enjoy the tea, after such solid \"tucker\". This camp is known as \"The Australian Rest Camp\" formerly used by the French. It has some two hundred and fifty tents each capable of holding easily ten men. Has a canteen, but it is not much good. There are four taps to wash \nwith\n at, equal to at present four hundred men one tap, equals a very large rush which equals a scramble, and finally that you do not get a wash at all. You are lucky to get your tooth brush wet. The showers however, have originated from the over strained working of some officer's brain, for we have two showers (each with a tin above holding a bucket of water. You carry the water to the place, climb up putting the water in. Now your\n\nshower. You turn it on and alas six little streams of water trickle down. This is your shower. But cheers, we have a Y.M.C.A here, so we are lucky in that respect. Did a fatigue at night, getting stuff of the trucks. Went to bed tired. Rolled up in the two blankets with waterproof under, & over coat as pillow. Very Cold during the night, as this is winter. Will be prepared tonight. Joints are stiff through the hard ground.\n","39":"\n\nWoke up early then waited till the \"Reveille\" went at 6:30 AM. Folded our blankets up putting them outside the tent, also our Kit Bags, so as the ground could be well airedwhere we sleep. Had breakfast of \"Bully Beef\" and tea. Had a so called wash. Parade at 9:30AM. Just \"fell in\" and Camps standing\n\nOrders were read out ot us. The rest of the day we watched the aeroplanes. Had Bacon (almost raw) Onions & Spuds for dinner. We were to go on leave this afternoon, but MIlitary like it was stopped at the last moment. Had to vote for the Conscription Question today. Most of the chaps voted \"NO\". Hope the remainder of Australian people do the same. The days are perfect; sun just warm with a lovely cool breeze blowing. The sky is a little paler that that of Australia, otherwise you would think the weatherAustralian. The Camp is on a level piece of land of hard sand which stretches to the sea on the West and to the Railway on the East. To the South lies Suez. The twilight is very short. It is getting very cold now although it is only sixteen o.clock (4PM). Had tea of Bread Jam and tea. Went\n\nto YMCA tent and did a little writing. The place was crowded. It is very cold.\n","40":"\n\nHad a good sleep during the night, up at Reveille 6.30 and had a wash. The taps are a good way from our tents. Had very plain breakfast of Bully Beef & bread. On Fatigues today. One section of each Reinforcements do all fatigues while the others go on leave. We go on leave tomorrow afternoon. Pitched tents till dinner time. Had Bacon and turnips. Egypt is waiting on the food from Port Sydney and a couple of other ships of food. Dug two houses or rather the foundation so as to lift them up. Some work. We didn't overwork ourselves.Shifted our tents again, so as unit will be compact. Had a sing song\n\nin YMCA the chaps who have just arrived back, do not think much of the town. It is cold as the sun goes down. One of the aeroplanes came down this morning, breaking propeller and machinery. These planes travel at 60 miles an hour having horse power of about 80. The wings are made of fabric or oiled silk. On each wing and at end are flaps which elevate or depress plane. These are worked by either pilot or observer.\n","41":"\n\nDid fatigues in the morning as usual. Had leave from 2PM till 9PM. Went in with two other tent mates. The town is about two miles from the camp. Some went in by Garries others on Donkeys while the remainder walked. Had a general walk around the various streets\n\nin the market place. The streets are narrow and dirty, also the shops, which are very small, and in disorderly fashion. Silks are the chief articles of interest to the troops. Bought a few Post Cards of different Ports in Egypt. Had a sort of a tea at a hotel. The best in the place, (except for the officers'). Returned back to camp about 9PM.\n","42":"\n\nDigging trenches all day, so there is little to tell. The 31st Reinforcement got all fatigues as we have \"rotten\" Officers who think of themselves.Most of the chaps took \"French Leave\" at night. I stayed in , and repacked Kit Bag, so as to be ready for the morning when we leave again. The lads came home about 7'Oclock, and have a lot to talk about. A lecture on Egypt was given by some chap. Very\n\ninteresting indeed. About two thousand men arrived today per the \"Nestor\" mostly Infantry, so we have a big camp now. Very tired so will turn in as there will be little sleep in morning & night of tomorrow. Posteda letter home.\n","43":"\n\nUp as usual at 6AM. Cleaned the lines up, then printed a few snaps of photos taken on Port Sydney. Took our Kit Bags over to the train some fifty yards distance; Then had a look at a few planes. Had a tea of Bully Beef & Biscuits as usual. Fell in at 6PM entrainingat 7PM. The train left the siding at 8PM. Played cards for a while then settled down for a nights unrest. Some gave various songs and unearthly noises till about\n\nmidnight. Most of us were sorry to leave this camp so soon. Arrived at Alexandra 5:30AM, so we saw little of Egypt. One chap described it as \"going to a concert and looking through the Key Hole. However we saw the Nile and a few other stations.\n","44":"\n\nA dull morning - formed up and set to work to get Kit Bags off trucks. This took about an hour. Got a little hot water from a and made a cup of soup, which went down well. Took our Kit Bags on board the SS\"Karoa\" 7000 tons speed 18 Knots a British India vessel. Our quarters are aft of starboard side of Troop Deck. It is pitch dark ( port holes closed ) with an electric light here and there. The deck is low and has a strange damp odour mixed with smell of paint, this makes\n\nmore trouble, to the weary overcrushed Gunners who have no tea in view & the floor as bed, together with the ever increasing vibrations of the ship, as she puts ever ounce of steam to send her flying a good eighteen knots through the danger zone of the Mediterranean Sea. There are about two thousand men on board, another cross channel vessel has a thousand Infantry on board. We are escorted by four destroyers the much advised \"White Ensign\"One is for'ard , other aft and on either side. The \"Karva\" has about twenty four life boats, and numerous up to date rafts, with hooks and oars on them. we have to sleep in uniform life Belt & Water bottle near at hand. The bad writing is caused through ship vibrating so much. Turned in early being very tired.\n","45":"\n\nDid not sleep much as night, the smell on deck being vile this was cleaned up by natives during the day it being dirty rotten water down the Hold close by. Picked a ticket for guard while on ship. The 31st again, get all the \"good fatigues. There are sixty of us on, doing two hours on and four hours off. We are guarding insignificant positions, such as water tap with the water turned off. Had a little sea runningall day, making this tub roll. All on hand wish she would go right over. Have had no food excepting for Bully Beef & Biscuits for now over a week. The meat on board like the bread cannot be eaten. This is the first batch of white soldiers to travel on her having taken on previous trips Indians. Engines stopped for two hours about midnight owning to a breakdown. The escorts\n\nwhich are constantly on either side, some mile away came over, to see what was doing. Have been going much slower since.\n","46":"\n\nOn guard from 6AM till 8AM. Sea very calm. Destroyers still in usual place. Men are sick of this vessel having nothing to eat excepting the Biscuits & Beef. Have to be ready to disembark tomorrow at 8AM, also not to see our Kit Bags till we get to England. The decks are crowded with men. Have not had our clothes off since leaving Suez. We feel anyhow. Rained heavily during the night. Chaps sleeping for'ard were \"ducked\" severely when she dipped her nose under the swell.\n","47":"\n\nArrived in sight of land about 6AM, very low lying coast with range of hills in\n\nbackground. We are in Gulf of Taranto. arrived in Bay of the same name, which is unprotected to seas, although to enemy craft, has strong submarine nets, and guns on fort at entrance. Anchored off the Old Town till 3PM as the entrance is only opened between 8AM - 9AM and 3 PM - 4PM. Numerous mine sweepers came out to do their most dangerous daily task at sea. The vessels work in pairs having nets between and steaming slowly ahead in danger zone. An Italian super-sub-marine circled continuously around the Bay afterwards proved to be its trial trip. By appearance it did about fourteen knots; had its conning Tower painted various colours, so as to be less discernible. At one time we had four branches of the Army very prominent. In the air, Aeroplanes and a Dirigible were flying; on the sea Destroyers and Battleships were slowly\n\nsteaming into the harbour; thirdly, we had the submarine close at hand. Then ourselves who represented the land portion.Steamed into the Harbour of Taranto slowly; here, perhaps, we witnessed one of the most impressive and enthrillingincidents of our lives. On one side of the entrance ( which is only wide enough to allow one ship to enter) which is a fort, hundreds of sailors and soldiers cheered and cheered; the other side grouped hundreds of soldiers and civilians, on the Promenade or rather street who also cheered and waved, this lasting till we rounded the corner. The city like Malta is built on the water's edge, some forty feet up, thus standing out conspicuously. The houses seem to be plainly built, while they are painted different colours. The new town is on the West of the entrance, the old on the East. Passed\n\nmany warships of the Italian Fleet, these in turns cheered us. There were three large Battleships. This is one of the four Italian Naval Bases. Above, the droning Buzz of the three Hydroplanes, drew our attention. They gave us a good exhibition in the air, also landing on the water, where they slide along for some distance. a close view showed that the engine is above the Heads of the Pilot and Observer, who sit together. They appear much safer than the land planes. As usual the troops were all over the ship looking at the very interesting sights. However one needed more than a pair of eyes for our attention was suddenly fixed on a trail of foam in the water caused by a torpedo, which cleared our bows by twenty yards. we did not see it till about one hundred yards off the ship. A submarine had fired a \"dummy\" at us\n\nIt stopped a few hundred yards off, where it sent out flashes intermittently. A launch took it back. Hunger was forgotten now by all, for events such as we had witnessed in the last hour, had been far too interesting to think of our Bully Beef etc. Hydroplanes came quiet close to the ship afterwards. On the shore is a camp which I believe tomorrow we will know more of than at present. Have to sleep on decks with nothing but uniform, as they took blankets and Beltsaway.\n","48":"\n\nUp at 5AM and had a wash. None of us slept well, being very cold at night. Had a little Bread & Margarine for breakfast. Cleaned up the ship alittle for all wished that the time would hurry and let us off. The first batch went off in two Barges ( these were used in Gallipoli ) under the command of a Naval officer. They counted the ship and officers out a few times.We left at\n\n10AM. We heartily counted out the officers and ship as we left her side. Formed up on jetty, then went up a hill to our huts which are shaped like a semi-circle at either end; about twenty feet wide 45 feet long, capable of holding forty men comfortably. Between each two men a mosquito net is placed, owing to the pests in summer. Had breakfast at 11AM of good stew and bacon & fresh bread. How we all smiled when eating it. Like children sitting at a Birthday party. Had orders read out to us, and all the lads burst out laughing when this was read out :- \"Camp Standing Orders by Sir \nPercy\n Cunningham\". Near by, just a few hundred yards away is the original Marconi Station. It is of course on a large scale. Had a game of soccer, on a muddy field with about six inches of mud on our boots. Some went over in the mud. Much to the fun of\n\nmany spectators. A train load of soldiers of Jamaica had just arrived from France, the weather being too cold for them. They talk excellent english. The camp covers a large area, but we are at present confinedto our own area, as measles have again broken out. Issued with three blankets as it is very cold here at night. Had hot dinner at 7PM of good hot stew and tea, which went down far too quick. Wrote alittle then turned in and had a good sleep.\n\nDecember","49":"\n\nHad a little rough play before we dressed at 7.30 AM. Had breakfast then formed up for church parade which was held in the open in front of the huts. The sermon was one of thanksgiving, havingarrived over the dangerous waters of Mediterranean Sea safely. Did alittle printing in afternoon, then\n\nwrote a few letters. It is very cold. especially when the sun goes down. Sunset is 4PM, darkness sets in very early. We are to be here sometime as measles have not yet been checked The chaps are playing soccer to get warm. Took a couple of photos of interiors of Hut and Marconi Wireless Station. Taking snaps is rather dangerous, as it is strictly forbidden. Had excellent lunch today of cheese, margarine, jam five ounces of Bread and paste, quite a feed for us. This is the first time we have ever felt right just below the belt since leaving the Port Sydney.\n","50":"\n\nOn Hut picquet, so as to get films cut up and do a little printing .They turned out to be good. Had a route march into the country. The land is well cultivated, the growing of olives\n\n\n\nseem to be the chief plant grown. The hedges are used as fences. The soil is very heavy and clayey, and at present nearly underwater. We went about three miles then turned back, having enjoyed a good march, also seeing a little of the country. Had the afternoon to ourselves, putting in time playing games not too tame. Settled down to write for the night but at 8.30 PM the officer came in detailing about forty of us for picquet as a couple of hundred chaps had gone to Taranto on French Leave. Marched to the lorries which whirled us into town a distance of three miles. Here we went in batches all over the town hunting up the sight seeing crowd. Being full moon, we looked at the town more than anything. There were more men let go than taken as this particular work is against the\n\ngrain of most of us. The town can be best explained by saying it is many York Streets of Sydney, with solid, four story houses having no windows but doors which open onto small verandahs. Most of the buildings are of white stone. In the wide streets are gardens, the streets are long and straight like in Melbourne. Had alittle excitement about 11 PM a wild Irishman refused to get into the lorry and threatened to stab the Colonel with a jack knife, two Tommiesgot him, then they heaved him in. Came back in lorries, being at least satisfied at having seen the town.\n","51":"\n\nXmas Day in the workshop indeed. Hullo, and its raining :- However a Happy Xmas to all. These were our greetings to one another. Got up at 8 AM and had breakfast consisting of stew.\n\nBread & Jam. Cleaned the hut then played Cricket with a board as a bat & tennis Ball. Had two innings, the first innings score was 28-27 the second 38 - 38 so they beat our side by very little. The sun came out at noon. Our Dinner, Had stew, tinned meat, & Bread - Second course :- Bread, cheese, jam. Third Course :-Figs ( dried & preserved ) fruit, and nuts, finishing up with toffee. We all enjoyed it. Played cards the rest of the day. At night we went on picquet but only went to the outskirts of the town, & did guard till 9 PM. Many sailors passed dead drunk and singing their favorite song. The harbour is very fine by night, puts one in mind of Sydney Harbour near Bradley's Head. Came back to camp & turned in. Thus ended my Xmas Day of 1917 :- Shall we see Xmas 1918 on active service is our question today. Hope not\n","52":"\n\nUp at 7.30 AM. Very cold and muddy outside. The camp is very heavy on the feet.The Australians were inspected by SirPercy Cunningham who thought much of the \"turn out\". After the Inspection we \"marched passed\" then went on a little route march along a muddy road. had dinner then wrote a few letters. It is very windy. Wrote in the afternoon and fixed photos at night.\n","53":"\n\nRaining during the night so ground is awful. Paid today. Have been writing all the morning. As we are leaving tomorrow, kit bags are being repacked. The Victorians are leaving tonight. Entrained at 5 PM, huddled together like sheep , alot of the windows are broken, so they will have to rough it, as it is raining heavily; with strong wind\n","54":"\n\nFixed up Kit Bags prior to taking them to the trucks. Entrained at 5 PM when we had tea. There are eight in each carriage. Our party drew the best of the bad lot of carriages. Left Cimino Camp Taranto about 7.30 PM; the night being moonlight we could see the country as we passed through. Olives seem to be the main fruit grown. All land is cultivated. The train is travelling very slowly, being exceedingly long. Passed a few stations, seeming to be shunting alot. Passed through Brindisi about midnight. None of us slept much, the room being inadequate and seats hard. One chap slept on the rack another on the floor. At 6.30 AM we arrived at Bari\n","55":"\n\nMess Orderlies went and obtained dry\n\nrations, so we had Breakfast in the train. We stopped near the main Street of this town, and soon had a crowd of people around, selling apples & wine the buildings are the same type in Taranto, the streets are wide and well made. The electric cars are the latest type. Had awalk to keep our feet warm. On the street can be seen women washing, fowls running loose, and goats and donkies roaming around. The carts used, have all large wheels evidently the custom in Italy. This place seems to be the manufacturing centre; wood seems to be used instead of coal, even in the Railway Engines. The morning is lovely, with the warm rays of sun coming in the carriage window. The railway is guarded by soldiers and Military Police. Papers are to be had but none of us can read Italian so they are practically useless.\n\nStoppped at for Refreshments: Bari, Foggia, Termoli, Fano, Faenza,Voghera and Turin.\n\nDeath of man labour is obvious as girls collect the fares on trams and trains. Speaking to an Italian soldier he said he did not like the war. This seems to be the sentiment of all people in South of Italy. They have never heard of Australia nor do they know where it is, so we say we are English going to France. It is now 10AM the town appears to be much busier leaving here we kept to the coast passing the towns of Malfetti, Trani, Barletta and Foggia. At the later place we had dinner and a long looked for wash, and stretch of legs. These towns passed are all of a fair size, having their large buildings and streets. The platforms are low down on the ground, not raised as in Australia. The gauge is 4' - 81\/2\". Ran into snow about Trani which increased as we went on the fields are covered with it , and\n\neach time it, the train stopped, the lads jumped off and had a snow ball fight, those staying in carriages getting their share. This made everything damp much to the disgust of all afterwards, however it made us warm.\n\nThe country is very hilly and every inch is cultivated, on the top of the hills, there is generally an old fort, situated in a predominating position. The sunset was beautiful as it went down over the snow covered hills, with a picturesque village in the valley. Played cards at night til about 8PM then \"turned in\" one chap perched up on the rack, rather a dangerous and uncomfortable position, Yet he slept more than the others, two more found themselves stretching out on the floor, the remainder took up positions on the lovely cushioned seats. The two \"lanks\" on one side, the three shorts on the other. I was one of the formers. Had a good sleep till\n\nSunday the","56":"\n\n1AM when the Orderly sergeant with his sonorous voice cries out \"ere two of use chaps go and get dry rations. Not only our compartment but all the train was awake, fancy our temper Tea at 1:30AM is not to be relished,even by hungry soldiers. We stayed at this place about an hour, it is a sea port named Termoli on the main line. Did not sleep much after this. The sea is about four yards from the line, the cross roads are all numbered, generally on the nearest House which are all old and showing signs of ware and tare. The farms are well irrigated being separated by stone hedges and bushes. Household water is obtained from stone wells which have also seen service.\n\nstopped at several stations the following being the chief ones, Loreto, Ancona, Fano, Pesaro Rimini and Faenza. At the former town, is an old castle several hundred years old, still intact, looking very formidable from the height. It is used as an observation station. At these town military uniform predominates the place being under Martial Law. Several trains of returning Italians were passed during the day. The distance between each town is generally four miles, and around each town is the cultivated fields, which are even cultivated onto the railway line. In some of the towns are canals, along which are many fishing craft. A noticeable custom of the people is the waving of their hands. They turn their hand palm up and close and open their fingers. We do this now & get a reply\n\nbefore, they would not. On the churches they have several Bells which peal their times out to the people, perhaps, now for Centuries. We ran into thick snow. The people dress much the same as in England, the men wear cloaks, the women rarely to be seen with hats on, the poorer class wear shawls. Most of the streets have avenues of trees, of course most streets are barren and desolate and covered with snow at the present. Arrived at Farenza a very large town, Typical of all other towns, has its large public buildings, and churches with its pealing Bells. These seem to get little rest. The streets were covered with snow and slush. The station is a good size. Put equipment on and formed up, leaving for a rest camp. two miles form the train. The streets were practically deserted. Those who watched us pass said in broken English, \"Good life & Good Luck\" muchly\n\nappreciated by all in the ranks. We had a hot dinner immediately on arrival, having \"Tommies\" to wait on us, so as to save time. They worked well, having hot water ready to wash our utensils up. we then went to tents and relieved ourselves of equipment, going in for a hot shower, and it was a dinkum hot bath too, this was greeted more so than dinner. Guess how we felt after a good meal and a hot bath, at least like tourists (for thetime) At this camp a good Canteen was well patronized, thus our mess has many good additions in the way of sauce. Jam and other small articles. I spared time to write a little in diary as it is impossible to write on train when it is going. Formed up and received anadditional blanket as would be cold crossing the lower portion of the Alps. Marched back very light hearted, despite the mud and slush which\n\nabounds here. The \"Tommies\" had cleaned our carriages out so we were good. oh. they didn't lose byit. They think much of the Australians, the men having behaved exceedingly well. This is the first lot to go through Italy. so it is an example to others following. Leaving here we arrived at Bologna about 10PM. This is a junction to Rome & Venice. It is a fine old station having several platforms. These are low down as I have explained, Sentries are all over the station, guarding food stuff etc. The express to Paris came in and out before us. We were issued a foot warmer one to each compartment. so we are set up for the night, much the same order as on the previous night. Slept till about 4AM se we know little of the\n\ncountry passed. Snow is very thick on the ground. The sun did not come up till about 8 AM on\n","57":"\n\nWhen we arrived at Voghera, having hot tea and drawing rations for the day The snow was thick. Had a lovely hot wash, then walked up and down alongside the train, getting exercise and warmth. This town has several factories, and is about the average size of the Italian town, which I should say would be the size of Bathurst. All houses are brick and solid. A British and Italian Hospital train passed us at Voghera. Leaving here with engine on other end we made out for Turon, passing through hilly country, perhaps the most picturesque since leaving. The land, houses, and trees, are thickly covered with snow. Passed over the Rivers Tanaroand Po, The scenery being very pretty.\n\nA few water mills could be seen working bringing us back to older days of history. At Turin the boys had a great snow fight, the snow being frozen. This lasted for over twenty minutes. Although making us wet we were warm after. Had hot tea and dinner here staying in all one hour. it is very cold and frosty. The towns up this way seem deserted very few people being about, most of them can speak broken English. Their language could be easily learnt, if one stayed in Italy a little while. Played cards for a couple of hours. The sun made its appearance for only two hours to day. Turin is a large place having a nice residential part, not seen in previous towns. Looking up a French phrasebook for awhile trying to get a few sentences off. Getting into the Alps now the Maritime Mts. The scenery is splendid, ranges rise\n\nup to the clouds, and the ravines are seemingly thousands of feet below, covered with a good foot of snow, the train travelled round edges of precipitous mountains. However the night came come quickly thus spoiling a more fuller view of this most magnificent scenery of the Southern Portion of the Alps. we crossed the Border of Italy about 11.40 PM and so ended the end of the trip through Picturesque and interesting Italy, incidentally ended the year of 1917, as a closing the majority of people in Italy seem to be against the war and believe England responsible for them being in. In the North of this country however it is different. The New Year found us in France, the country which is fighting for its existance and ours. A new feeling seemed to possess us, for the feeling in this country is different than Italy, and we are proud of France as an Ally\n","58":"\n\nAs the clock showed 12PM the lads awake in the train gave three cheers thus entered the new year. Had a good sleep till about 6AM when we pulled up at Montmelian for Breakfast, and dry stores. Had a wash, the water was cold next to ice. for no sooner was it out of the tap on the ground than it froze. On either side precipitous hills leapt up.covered with thick snow, which dazzles in the sun-light. Passed through country whose splendour cannot be described in words. At the foot of a high mountain the beautiful lake of Aix-Les-Baines lies which winds between the two Ranges with the trains alongside the lake. The tunnel entrance has a castle at each end. Pulled up at Chamberg, here we tried to talk to the French on the station, they do not seem very happy. It is a\n\nlarge station. Left here running into beautiful scenery unprecedented since starting, followed the River Rhone up to Lyons; it is a beautiful river with mountains rising up from the banks, with fur trees covered with snow and other cultivated areas. A noticeable feature of Agriculture is the way they cultivate up the side of steep hills, which seem to be almost perpendicular. Vineyards are to be seen mostly. Arrived at Lyons about 3 PM the station was deserted, not a single person on it. This seems strange for one of the largest towns of France. The streets are narrow buildings a couple of storeys, old, built of stone and very plain. Electric trams are used. Women do the work in the goods sheds, those pulling carts have dogs tied to the axle, which pull, making\n\nthe task much easier. Near the town can be seen Sports Ground which now has thousands of motor cars in, evidently used by the military. Along the banks of river is a beautiful promenade, although now covered with snow and deserted. Pulled out of this city to the next small station by name La Germain, \nEl de Mar.\n\nThe French towns are not so large as in Italy or so frequent when passing through in the train. Yet this portion of France is not as thickly populated at the Coast & Northern districts. The train that left before us is still here, waiting to go on. Fell In and marched about two miles through thick snow to the camp, which is at the bottom of a steep hill. Allotted to tents, eight in each. Six inches of snow lies on the tents. It is now snowing fairly heavy. Had a hot tea. Not too many availed themselves of the cold water taps. One wash aday is\n\nsufficient these days. We feel it in our feet the most. The tent is now covered with snow from the boots. One good idea on the Railway is the way of changing carriages or trucks to other lines without shunting, they have a slide crossing the lines at Right angles on which \nis\n are two lines the same gauge as the others. A horse pulls the trucks onto this and then pulls the slide across to the line required. Had a walk to Canteen and chatted to some Tommies just from England onto Salonika. They say it is good weather over there, but submarines are busy in channel. Turned in early having a ripping good sleep.\n","59":"\n\nUp at 7.30 AM and had a breakfast of tea, Biscuits and cheese. It is very cold. They had to heat the drinking water to melt it. Had a walk around the camp to keep feet warm. This is an impossible thing to do\n\n\n\nalthough you have two pairs of socks on.\n\nFell in at 11Am and marched down to the train, not at all sorry to leave this dismal place with a foot of snow over every inch of it. Train moved off about 1PM and passed over very much of the same kind of country as before. Very little life is to be seen which makes the place more cheerless.\n\nA few people can be seen at the windows. Those who do not venture in the street are in mourning. Plenty of soldiers can be seen. Their uniform is Blue ( Sky Blue ) having a cloak instead of overcoat. The towns are small and far between.\n\nMost of the land is well cultivated. Passed plenty of fur trees which is typical Alpine scenery. The boughs and branches are covered with snow. These trees extend up a steep hills making a very picturesque picture. The houses are old, generally two storey made of brick having their out houses near by. have slate roofs. Came into Moulins about\n\n6PM when tea was issued to all. This is a large town in Centre of France. Have a large Station. In France, the station is on one side with platforms extending out. The platforms are about a foot above the ground. Stayed at this place about an hour. Then moved off. The next station we arrived at of importance was Bourges. However we were all in bed? so did not see much of it. One chap made a blanket of hammocks so we had ample room, every one having a good sleep, till 3AM when the hammock collapsed waking all up especially the chap the occupant fell on. It is not snowing much in this particular part of France.\n","60":"\n\nArrived at Tours about 8 AM where we had breakfast, made of Bully Beef heated up in water. Had tea and issued with dry rations. One loaf of Bread to eight men per day so we have to go careful with it. A\n\n\n\ntrain of Americans passed us. they are some \"skites\" too, about what they will do etc. Very little snow is to be seen about. Tours is a large place, of course little can be seen from the train. It is on the banks of the River Loire which runs into the Bay of Biscay. By the paper it has been 20 Degrees below freezing point at Lyons, so this will give one an idea of the cold. The sun at Tours is already up, so it is much warmer. We are nearing the coast. A lot of the first train missed theirs and had to wait for this train.\n\nPassed over the beautiful river Loire. It is very wide although a good bit is frozen over, some few people were skating on it. Passed through well cultivated land although at present it is unkept. The houses are very few in comparison to Italy. Each house has its garden, most of the plants being covered over with glass bowls protection against the frost\n\nThe sun has shone for sometime now. Little snow lies on the ground although the wind is biting. Came into Le Mans a fine large town with modern houses. It is on a tributary of the Loire. Rowing boats and places of amusement can be seen on the banks. In peace it must be a pleasure resort. Has large manufacturing buildings. Several gangs of \"Huns\" are working on the Railway Lines. They seem in good condition and well clothed. Passed another French Hospital Train loaded with patients. River Sarthe is the tributary mentioned. Buying bread at the stations is the great fun havingto get there before the Officers pull you out. It is 10 aloaf of 2 lbs. Everyone exercises at each stop being cramped up all day. The day is beautiful and clear, the best since leaving Faranto. Along the line a few people gave apples to the men along the train\n\n\n\nThey are much warmer in their welcome than in Italy. Le Mans station is very fine, one of the best passed through yet. On every church yet passed is a clock and the Railway Stations have their share of them. At this station a clock stands on every platform. Had an hour's stay so had a good walk along the platforms. Bought Bread and Post Cards here. The Paris Express went out, so the boys gave a few sheers to the waves of people in it. Went outside the station alittle and had a look at a couple of streets. They are very narrow and the buildings are old. All people are in mourning. They are very sad and wonder why we are so gay and lighthearted. Some asked for souvenirs and badges. The O.C. of train, a lieutenant of Gallipoli, is an absolute dinkum and perfect gentleman, of course he can get the boys to do anything without asking a second time, and he asks as man to man\n\nWe have many privileges which other \"stars\" would not permit. He came up last night and said \"Now lads try & have a shave before getting to Cherbourg as I would like you to look fresh, so as not to make the impression of having had a bad time\". Although it was dark nearly everyman set to work with pleasure and had a rough shave in candle light with train going. It is no easy task. Any other officer would have got the reply impossible. This is just an example. It is very cold. The moisture on windows froze. Played cards till 10 PM the turned in.\n","61":"\n\nArrived at Cherbourg about 6AM. The train took us into the barracks near the wharf, so did not see anything of the port. Had Breakfast of usual Bully & Bread (one slice) and cold tea. Had a good wash. Although the sun is up\n\nit is very cold on feet and hands. The first train embarked last night for Southampton. We are leaving here about 2 PM. Most of the chaps are satisfied with the trip. Have seen the country, people, habits etc of both Italy & France. Seen the Alpine Districts with it frozen water falls and rivers, the old time water wheels and canals. We all however would have liked to see the towns & villages more, yet that at present is impossible. In all the seven days in the train went far to quickly, all being so absorbed in the picturesque scenery and new country. We had plenty of \"tucker\" which helped the trip to be successful. We are now looking forward to seeing old England & the eight days leave. Had dinner then embarked on the \"Prince George\" 900 tons cross-channel steamer 20 knots. The town of Cherbourg\n\nis fairly large having wide streets, and Quays also the quaint French style of Houses. A few people waved goodbye to us from the Quay. Anchored out in stream till dusk then cut over to Southampton, anchoring near Netley. Took five hours to get across the channel was calm. The men slept all over the ship, huddle together like sheep, having no blankets, we put in a cold night.\n","62":"\n\nMen were very interested in the largest of our ships the \"Aquitania\" 45,000 tons of hospital ship. Pulled into the docks and waited for a couple of hours before we disembarked. Had coffee & cake then entrained for Salisbury, to the station of Codford. This took about 90 minutes. Band met us and played us into camp a distance of over two miles along a country lane with the old English\n\nhedges on either side. Had dinner then distributed into various training batteries. Most of New South Wales chaps are in No 3 Battery. We are in Isolation for four weeks. Allotted to huts twenty two in each, so we have ample room. A fire is in each hut and we can use it after 4.30 PM each day. Have chaffand five blankets each.\n","63":"\n\nMess Orderly to day. Reveille at 6.30 AM when horses are watered & fed. Have fairly good Breakfast. Received our kit Bags. So can now have a clean up. It is raining and cold. Wrote letters to put time in.\n","64":"\n\nUp as usual; went for a two mile route march along a country lane. After breakfast we each took a horse for exercise. Went some three miles along the road. We were medically examined in afternoon after which\n\nwe went for another march about another three miles, so we are alittle footsore, and tired. Wrote letters at night and cleaned equipment as we haven't time in morning.\n","65":"\n\nFreezing cold morning with biting wind. Went for a route march before breakfast. Could not wash as water was frozen in taps. Went for another route march about several miles around two neighbouring villages. they are small but old as the hills, some houses dating 1728. One old town prison is still remaining on the footpath; it is a small round hut capable of holding three people. the churches are very fine old buildings with grave yards around, and the walk under the avenue of trees to the entrance. All land is cultivated well, also irrigated. The little canals are frozen over. At one of these\n\nthe boys had great fun sliding over it for half an hour. Many fell much to the fun of spectators. We are all footsore. Issued with heavy boots to break in. Snowing alittle. Allotted to C subsection for training purposes. Sent letter home.\n","66":"\n\nWent into stables this morning, after breakfast went for short route march, then a Captain gave us a lecture on the various gases. There are five kinds. The latest is known as mustard gas. Causes blisters to come on skin, & you lose your eyesight temporarily. Had Gas Mask Drill for an hour, after which we went into a room and the chlorine was turned on. They made us take our helmets off when in the room awhile. It made us cry or rather tears came in our eyes. Exercised horses all the afternoon\n\n\n\nAt night wrote letters. It is very cold.\n","67":"\n\nHad to go to Codford to Army Service Corps to load wheat for horses at ourcamp. Came back at 9.30 AM and finished for day. Wrote letters in spare time.\n","68":"\n\nIn stables early morning after breakfast exercised horses, taking them eight miles along road. We were very foot sore when coming back, had to do an hour's Physical Culture. they keep us working. At stables in afternoon. Most of us hate this job as the horses are a dash nuisance besides a fiery lot, delight in Kicking. Had a walk to Haftesbury at night then wrote letters. It has been warm today\n","69":"\n\nDid Stables in morning; then had afternoon off, so repacked my kit Bag. At night had a walk into Heytesbury a distance of two miles.\n","70":"\n\nHad church service at 10 AM when we all enjoyed the service. The Chaplain was modern in his words, also not tiring. The hymns were sung with plenty of volumn. Did horses after the service. In afternoon had a walk along an old English Lane, just wide enough to let two vehicles pass. At one place can be seen the old Toll Gate and House, with the Keepers House close by. A fine view of the surrounding country can be had from a hill near the camp\n\nThe land is well cultivated. A few dairy farms are scattered around. Had to do guard from 4 PM till 4 PM Monday.\n","71":"\n\nSnowed heavily during night so guard was not much good. The country has now about six inches of snow over it, making a very pretty scene, with the leafless trees covered with the snow, even to the finest branch. The farms in the distance are covered also the Haystacks. Of course the Australians started snow Balling each other till parade time. When a little wind sprang up the snow on trees fluttered down making a lovely scene. Wrote letters at night.\n","72":"\n\nHad lectures on different kinds of shells used in 18 pound Field Gun\n\nThe most common are shrapnel and High Explosive. The Shells are painted different so as to pick them out. Have an hour's Physical Training each day. Had Gun Drill, and it is a hurry up, having to do it very quickly. You are supposed to be able to load up before the gun comes back to its position from the recoil. Had Lecture on Gunnery. We are now learning alittle. The instructors are very capable.\n","73":"\n\nStables in the morning. Had knotting and lashing then fuze setting. In afternoon had Gun Drill. and lecture by an officer on France and \"Fritz\". He put the \"wind\" up on us alright. Its not healthy over there. Snowed during the day. Isolation has been lifted from today. Wrote letters at night\n","74":"\n\nWent over to Sutton VenyHospital to have a swab taken of throat. Each man has to go over. we however picked a bad day, as had six inches of snow tramp through and pouring rain. Took an hour to get there and another to come back. In afternoon dug trenches on side of a hill. Very wet at finish of day.\n","75":"\n\nWent into Codford for load of oats. Then did stables to dinner. After dinner went in for another load at Codford. Still raining steadily. Finished up at 5 PM. Wrote letters at night. Received a letter from Bob Forsyth.\n","76":"\n\nHad usual Gun Drill and lectures till noon. Wrote letters in afternoon doing stables at 4 PM. Turned in early.\n\n\n","77":"\n\nDid stables, then went to church parade, but could not get in; hall being crowded. Came back and cleaned harness. Had afternoon off so cleaned up generally. At night four of us went down to Church of England at Heytesbury. A fine old building dating back to the 15th Century. Crowded with khaki, very few civilians being there. A good service. had a look over it after service, not at all bad Pipe Organ - Went into Institute along road and had supper.\n","78":"\n\nUsual Drill on Guns and shells. On Guard till tomorrow, so there is no news. Raining heavily. Guard stunt no good.\n","79":"\n\nOn guard still till 4 PM when we\n\n\n\n\n\nwere relieved.

He looks well & is on a good stunt. getting ready for leave which starts tomorrow.\n","92":"\n\nUp at 5 AM and had breakfast\n\nMarching off at 6 AM we took the train to London. At Paddington station I left the party who marched to the A.I.F. Headquarters With another chap we went to Euston Station fixing up our passes to go via Holyhead. This took an hour. Then went out to Col Atkinson's Maida Vale, and stayed there. Called on Mrs Martin with Mrs Atkinson. she was pleased to see me. Left by the mail train for Holyhead which arrived at Kingston early in the morning and went up to Dublin a matter of twenty five minutes. Called on my Uncle. He took me over their Guinness's Brewery the largest of its kind\n","93":"\n\nThis Brewery was founded about the Year 1759 and up till 1825 the trade was local, from this date the trade went to England and foreign trade started 1860. The constituants of this beverage consists solely of the following Pale Malt, a certain amount of Roast Malt or Barley to which is due the brown colour of stout, and Hops. The water for brewing purposes comes from the springs which feed the upper level of the Grand Canal, in the Country Kildare. The amount of water used per Year is about 600,000,000 gallons. The first vessels to meet the eye are the Underbacks, designed to hold the sweet liquor known as Wort which percolates through from the vessels, immediately above, and con\n\nstitutes stout in the first stage. By ascending the stairs the Kieve or Mash Tun stage is rearched. These circular vessels, 24 in number and each capable of holding 200 barrels of Malt, are, amongst the most important in the Brewery, for in them the extraction from the malt of the necessary constituents for making stout takes place. The process is briefly as follows:-\n\nThe malt, which has been ground the day before into the large Hoppers above the Mash Tuns is let down gradually at an early hour in the morning through the slide at the base of the Hoppers into cylinders, which command the Mash Tun. Here it is met by a stream of hot water ascending. Inside the cylinder are rakes that revolve at a High\n\nspeed and mix malt and water together. Inside the Mash Tunis another set of rakes, which travels round the edge of the vessel by means of a rack and wheels, for the purpose of further mixing. The liquor is then drawn off through the slotted plates forming the false floor of the Mash Tuninto the Underbacks beneath. By this time the constituents soluble in water & necessary for the manufacture of stout have been extracted. This is then pumped into twelve fermenting tunseach holding 1400 barrels. Yeast is added to excite the necessary fermentation, which takes two days; the wort is pumped to open vessels for the purpose of cooling, and also for the skimming-off of the yeast, which reproduces itself about 15 times\n\nWhen the yeast is off, it is pumped to huge vats, each having 1\/2 mile of iron hoop around it, holding 1700 Hogshead ( 52 gallons ) About 4000 people are employed.\n\nLeaving this very interesting place we went around the centre of city.The main streets and buildings are very fine of course Sackville Street near the Post Office is in ruins, caused by the Rebellion a year ago. The electric service of trams (double deckers) is excellent. Went to a theatre at night. The city lighting is not restricted as in London so it is a pleasure getting around at night. Stayed with Uncle till morning when I caught the 9 AM train to the North . The population of Dublin is about\n\na half million. There is no food restrictions, and food is plentiful. The Railway Stations are fine large places, and the train services are very good. I was sorry that I only had a day in this place, but hope to get there again.\n","94":"\n\nThe train journey up took four hours. Kept along the coast as far as Dundalk, when we changed and went inland. The country has had too much rain, the land being covered with water, so ploughing is delayed. My Uncle Charlie met me at the station and we went up to the House in the Jaunting Cart\n\nHad a look around the House & land. Much the same as when I was there last time. A good deal\n\nof the land is ploughed. Both Aunt & Uncle are looking well. Had a good sleep at night as you can imagine.\n","95":"\n\nWent to church with A & U. The driver of the Jaunting Cart was dressed up to kill, in a uniform of navy serge and swank buttons. (The pity is the photo is no good).\n\nThe church is a fine old church capable of holding the population of Dromore twice over. The minister was awful. Uncle went to \nchurch\nsleep in church. Have good fires in the church. Grandfather is buried in the yard adjoining church.\n\nIn afternoon received Australian letters sent from camp. So spent a good afternoon reading them\n","96":"\n\nUncle and self had arranged to go out Snipe shooting all day , but it poured raining throughout the whole day. so did little. Shot a few pigeons which came up close to the house. Had game of Deck Quoits and put in time generally.I like this way of just doing as you like and plenty of time to do it in. Copied dates concerning family out of old Bible used some years ago by Grandfather. Also took a copy of the Hamilton Crest. At night we played the game of 500 till late. They like this game.\n","97":"\n\nVery cold, there being a frost on the ground. Clear day; very nice in sun. With Uncle & Aunt we walked into the town, about four\n\nmiles, along the country road. Had a fine view of District around Dromore from the hills. Every inch of ground is cultivated and the farmers are busily plowing and heavy work it is too. There are numerous small lakes. Met an old school mateof my father's who was exceedingly glad to see me. He is a typical Orangeman, by name George Donnell. Remembers many instances of young days. Still has a flute my father gave him when he was leaving \"Lakemount\". Dromore has a population of 476 people and consists of about four streets of old houses, majority in decayed condition. Had a look over Uncle Jim's garden, then took photo of old church, which my\n\nGrandfather attended when a boy. It is now in ruins. Saw the Marshall boys (?). Walked back for dinner. It is a lovely day. In afternoon went out rabbit shooting, but did not get one. Saw another school mate of Dad's, Robt Coulter by name is a tenant\ns\nof Uncle's. Another staunch Ulsterman. Thinks I'm like \"Master Robert\". Uncle Jim came up for dinner, after which we played four hand 500, till about midnight. Uncle Jim & I lost by one game - Uncle Charlie likes winning.\n","98":"\n\nFixed up Aunt's Bicycle putting protector \nof\n over back wheel. Rather a long job. Received more letters. Had a walk around the House\n\nand garden taking a few snaps. The garden is just beginning to show signs of coming out. For this year the winter is over early. Had late dinner, then walked leisurely down to the station. The rain again wept at my departing. I'm evidently a Jonah for the rain has come down on the both occasions I have been there. Arrived at Dublin about 8 PM when we took the boat over to Holyhead. The ship was just packed with soldiers on the way to France after leave in Ireland. The sea was calm; night moonlight so \nthough\n tin fish might prowl about. However we arrive safely at the port\n","99":"\n\n6AM found me at Euston Station so went to Hotel and had a bath and breakfast. After this strolled round in search of a Kodak's place. Took a bus & had a glance at a few main places of London, then called in at Commonwealth Bank. At noon found me at Col Atkinson's.\n\nWent for a walk around Maida Vale with the Colonel. This use to the the residential su\nr\nburb of London once, But now the fine large Houses are practically in ruins. The Streets are wide. A canal runs through the district this is strange being so near to the city of London. Stayed here till 6PM when I had to leave for the train to camp, arriving at this\n\ncheerless place about 11 PM. And so ended my Irish Leave and to say the least I wish it had been 80 days. If by chance a few days happen my way prior to going over I am sure Dublin will have them.\n","100":" \nto\n and","101":"\n\nHad the old gun drill etc again the remainder of Reinforcements are not going on leave for another week. Dom Johnson is in","102":" Battery, so had a chat with him. He is warmedfor draft.\n","103":" to","104":"\n\nOn Sunday Dom Johnson & self went over to see Clarrie Brooks at Sandhill Camp. had a fine old talk. Came back at 8 PM\n\nIt is about 90 minutes walk back. Met an old friend from Water Board Ern Pullen, who was wounded, and now about to hop over again. Had quite a long talk to him of days gone.\n\nAm in the Layers class, about twelve of the best layers in the group picked out. it is interesting work. the remainder of Reinforcements went on leave on Thursday, so our Hut is practically deserted, there being only nine left. \"Chips\" Wood a mate of mine contracted measles, so our Hut is now isolated. we are a happy family, have all meals in the Hut and plenty of it, in fact too much for we often wish to have a sleep in the afternoon. The boys when they come back from leave will just roar, having to leave the old\n\nHut till isolation is lifted. The windy weather came in time for on the","105":" March, the wind was terrific and cold. All did a freeze. The older chaps feel it acutely. It goes through the strongest of us. A little snow fell. It is a belated winter alright. The green leaves are just showing life, so in a month the hedges should be very picturesque.\n","106":" to","107":"\n","108":" and today I have reached my majority. Received mail from Home which was eagerly read. They are the best presents one could get.\n\nOs Fernscame over in the afternoon so had a good long talk of our leave. He had an excellent time in England and looks well. The cold winds are still blowing. They seem perpetual\n\nWrote letters Home at night. On Monday , Tuesday & Wednesday mornings we had to go to Sutton Venyto have throat sprayed. There are about five hundred in Isolation. It is a six mile walk, so just cuts out the morning. The wind is still fierce and cold, almost unbearable. Passed out Gunnery on Thursday & on Friday morning warmed for draft; some eight hundred in all the Brigade going. Went to Warminster on Saturday & met Os Ferns, both had our photo taken Developed three spools at night. of the Gas test with the Guns. They turned out good. Have been busy with Q.M. Store getting fresh issue of clothing etc. Had Gas Drill with Helmets; they take getting use to\n","109":" to","110":"\n\nAt Q.M. Store all morning returning old issue of clothing. Sent Camera to London. It was like parting with an old friend having had it for two years. Today has been glorious a typical Australian Day with beautiful sun. Passed out as Gun Layer on Monday. Had an easy test, as we have not had the training. On Tuesday, packed up ready to leave the following morning. About five hundred are leaving. We are taking little Kit with us. Just a change of clothing and socks, with one blanket.\n","111":"\n\n\"Reveille\" at 6 AM we cleaned up our huts and had an early breakfast. The usual hustle of men getting things they had omitted to put in Kit etc.\n\nthe previous night prevailed. However this soon stopped with the bugle sounding the Fall In. Rolls were called & rechecked, and at 9 AM we moved off to Codford. After receiving light refreshments from Y.M.C.A we entrained arriving at Southampton near 1 PM, immediately embarking on a small cross-channel steamer by name \"Queen Alexandria\", a fast boat, much to our delight. Had a fair amount of room on her considering, and all our \"clique\" had a good sleep, although the life belts were a little hard. Le Havre the Australian Base for reinforcements was reached about midnight, about seven hours run only.\n","112":"\n\nLe Harve has a fine harbour, and an immense shipping trade. There are several locks. The town from\n\n\n\n\n\nthe distance seems very large, and has the typical French Houses. Disembarked about 6 AM and walked through the outskirts of town. It seems very dirty. Have numerous Hun Gangs working on wharves. They are in good condition. Arrived at our camp about 11.30 AM, a little tired. It is beautiful weather. The camp is situated on a steep hill overlooking Harfleur a small town near Le Havre. Have fourteen in each tent so things are a little congested. Issued with \"Tin Hat\", waterproof cape etc; Then went through the usual Medical Inspection. At night an American Concert Party entertained the troops at the Y.M.C.A. Hut. They were exceedingly good. The Huts here are very spacious. and have all that one needs.\n","113":"\n\n\"Reveille\" at 6.30 AM. They have daylight saving here. Had an early breakfast then the whole reinforcement went about 2 miles to the Gas School. Had to wear our tin Hats. They are alittle heavy to begin with. Had lectures and practical work all day, also our Gas Helmets tested. The weather is still fine. The food here is plentiful and good. Put the night in at the Pictures.\n","114":"\n\nPut in the day fixing up for going up the line. A lot of the 31st chaps are on draft. so they have separated very well, much to our disgust. Wrote a few letters in afternoon. It is lovely weather, very warm in sun. A few had leave to Le Harve. Pictures again attracted us.\n","115":"\n\nDetail for guard, so set to work to clean equipment, as best dressed man gets off duty, and has an afternoon pass to town. My luck was in and I won the prize. About two hundred of the Boys left early this morning for up the line. Wrote letters and went to church at night the C of E chap is High Church, & the lads do not like it. Old Mac who is a Pres felt out of place.\n","116":"\n\nDetailed to our divisions this morning. Pinkerton, Mac & myself are in the fourth Division. have been lucky sticking together so long - Had a Special church service prior to leaving as we go in morning. Went on leave to Le Harve by myself. It is about 30 minutes in\n\ntrain to the town. Picked up with an infantry chap so we had alook around together. The town is large, has very few fine buildings, fine large streets, but filthy. There seems to be plenty of business doing. The shipping trade is immense, there being a fine harbour. The tides are large. The Quay is a fine portion of the town. Food is not too plentiful. Arrived home early and packed up Kit, preparatory to leaving in morning.\n","117":"\n\n\"Reveille\" at 5 AM when we had some food. Fell In about 6.30 AM, packed up, so that we could scarcely move. Moved off about 8 AM on the long march to Le Harve about seven miles. We had many\n\nrests as our Kit naturally became heavier. A Tommy Band played us in most of the way.Arrived in the town about 11.30AM, hot and illtempered. Allotted to trucks, about twenty five in each, so have a good number to Keep the truck warm. The greater part of train is occupied by Americans. They are a fine type of man, although they swank alittle. Moved off about 1PM and were lucky in getting through so quickly. The country up this way is in good condition, and well cultivated. Played cards to pass time away. Rained most of time. Pulled up for hot water about dark. All turned in about 6PM the best way possible, and awoke at 8 AM on the ","118":" not alittle fresh. However had\n\nan impromptu wash near a railway station. Arrived at Hazelbrouck a fairly large town about 11 AM, when we detrained, and went to a Rest Camp. This camp is a billet in a large House, that has been destroyed by shells. Had all conveniences however, so we all enjoyed a shave and a wash. A few of us went into town and had a feed. This town has been shelled for the last few days and the people have the \" Wind up\" and have left for healthier regions. The Town square is fine. The buildings are all old and poor looking. The Cathedral seem to get all the money, for they are beautiful beyond imagination. Leaving here we got another train and went about twenty miles further North to Bailleul where\n\nwe reported to a base. Had tea then went into town. This place is much like previous town stopped at. Has a large square, with principal buildings around it. A good many have been destroyed by shell fire. Our Huts are protected up to about three feet with sand against bombs. Did not sleep much owing to noise of our guns. An occasional Hun shell came dangerously near, although the town received a good number.\n","119":"\n\nHad Gas masks tested, then with full kit set out to find the 4th P.A.C's Headquarters. Some chaps were lucky and received alift when near the town, However about twenty of us were unlucky, so had to tramp about eight miles, in Hot\n\nsun. Went through Loere near the border of France & Belgium, Near here the Huns put a few shells over us, and made us feel uneasy. Took turns at carrying the Kits which did not g on waggon. Arrived at the Headquarters and had dinner. The Colonel then asked us particulars and let mates keep together, and to go to same Brigade. He was very good to us. A guide took us to the No1 Section of A.D.A.C., where I was put in \"D\" Sub Section with \"Mac\" & \"Pink\" Having only one blanket we were very cold at night.\n","120":"\n\n\"Reveille\" went at 6.30 AM when the Horses & \"Donks\" were watered & fed. the latter are proper \"dopes\" and hated by all. Feltthey do good work and are hardy and strong workers\n\nabout ten of us had to go to a dump to load 4o5\" shells. A \"G? Waggon took us out, the distance being about six miles, through Kemmel, which has and is being shelled fairly heavily. The church spirebuilding is in ruin. Had to load Gas Shells onto trucks and bring them up to the main line about five hundred yards. Had sport coming back on trucks, like a scenic way, only a few 9.2\" Hun shells made things alittle uneasy, particularly when we were at the shell dump. All shells went into Kemmel. Had to load up 1250 cases which took us to 1030 PM to do. Our hands were cut & sore, and majority agreed that it was the hardest days work they had ever done. Luckily a waggon took us home, and a rough trip at that.\n","121":"\n\nDid not get up for first parade. Knocked about stables all the morning. After dinner received orders to leave this position, as division was drawing out. This meant Hustle. Made up the feeds for the sub & fed the Donks & watered, Packed our Kit and put them on the Limbers & waggons. I am detailed to stay back to load up the ammunition. The Section pulled out about 6PM. Had a good nights sleep. Up at 4.30AM & packed about seven \"GS\" Waggons. Left the camp about 6AM on.\n","122":"\n\nWe jumped up on waggons. It is a beautiful morning. Just lovely bathing in the sun. The foliage is just coming out and the crops peeping up above the ground. The people are going to\n\nchurch. The 1st Division are taking our position. Could not go through Bailleul owing to bombardment of same. this meant several extra miles journey round. Passed through several villages. The old Houses are very quiet and old. Yet they are fascinating, with old thatch roof, water mill and barn. Most of Houses are painted white. The people are Flemish. Passed border about 7 AM. The roads are rough. Arrived up to the Battery about noon and had dinner. Fritz had shelled this camp the day previous. when the first division left at about 2PM and it indeed formed a long line stretching along the roads for a great distance. Passed many villages, the people keep the sabbath here, & appear to be great church goers.\n\nThe interior of churches are wonderful. I was on a waggon as brakesman, a good job, for you can sit down. Passed through a large town about dusk named Merville; Pitched camp at a Billet about a mile out.\n\nWatered and fed the \"Donks\", then had a well earned hot meal. Billeted in Farm Houses and barns. Several of us slept under a \"G S\" Waggon, with plenty of Hay to keep us warm. This is my first night of Roughing it.\n","123":"\n\nStarted out again on our journey at 9 AM after the usual waiting. The weather is perfect so the travelling is not so hard. This part of country is in good condition, the crops just coming up. Rode a mule and led a lame mare all day. We are at the end of the column, with the spare horses.\n\nPassed through many large towns, most of which have signs of the war on them. At dusk we entered Houdain, and camped there the night. We were Billeted in a Estaminet( Hotel ) all the sub section. The whole D.A.C. were in various houses. Had a good sleep.\n","124":"\n\nOn the road again at 8.30 AM, the roads are crowded with English Artillery and French people who are leaving for safer towns. You could see, the farm carts, packed with Mattresses; with oats or Hay, driven by an elderly man far too old to do such work, the cattle following the cart, kept together by a feeble old lady or perhaps daughter of the old chap, the children sitting in the cart looking down at the traffic & so all through the Hot day & dust this goes on, an endless chain of\n\nwar material going to different places in the line. After a hard days travelling we pulled into an open paddock for the night at Saulty\n.\nHad tea, then made a bed out of Hay in the open. Slept well being tired.\n","125":"\n\nMoved out early in morning on the track, and went through villages now deserted by the inhabitants, asthese places are frequently shelled day and night coming through the small village, a Hun came over in one of our planes dropping three bombs, which landed about ten yards from the road, blowing a few off their horses. The road was soon cleared. This gave us alittle \"Wind Up\". Pulled into a field with crops just coming up but now deserted by the farmer, for the Huns are very near, and you can see our large guns firing. They\n\nmade a great row, more so than the Hun shells exploding. Had to sleep out in open. I Being on guard had a position under a limber.\n","126":"\n\nPulled out early, and at noon arrived at Warloy, where our guns are in position. The large guns are near the road & make a Great noise & flash. The mules are fairly steady under fire.\n\nPut into a farm house for two hours then went down the road alittle way. Detailed to go with the limbers up to the guns, so left about 2PM going through Warloy and made up to the line, passing many Batteries of Heavy guns, and going through Henencoast, arrived at the Batteries which are in action open warfare position on a side of a hill, thus very exposed to the Huns, who can\n\nsee you coming over the Hill. The drivers make the old tired mules travel over it too. This town has been shelled considerably, and has several Hospitals in it. Just a clearing station. You can see for miles away from the Hill, all ploughed & crops up on land, and at present few shell holes. Came back to village, then had to go to a dump for ammunition, but they had none so turned into a aerodrome and it was a welcomed rest, as it had rained for a few hours, & everyone was wet through. The mules were exhausted. Had huts to sleep in,so we were lucky.\n","127":"\n\nOn Stable picquet all say, so had an easy day and a chance to dry clothes. The teams went out for ammunition and came back about noon, so\n\nthe \"Donks\" had a well deserved spell. Turned in early as we have to leave this home, and report back to the village. Wrote a few letters. Killed a heifer, so had extra meat.\n","128":"\n\nStill wet. On same job as yesterday. nothing much to do. Teams went out after dinner to Battery I remained behind to go with a General Service Waggon to the village so am lucky being out of rain. The \"Heavies\" around us, are pouring the shells into the Huns. Arrived at the village of Contary where the remainder are camped. This place is practically under water, so it is hard dirty work, feeding the mules etc, and doing other numerous fatigues. Found a Billet in a loft of a large barn, so we are out of rain luckily. The Chateau\n\nis a fine building with beautiful grounds. Has a large stream running through it. The owners have left it in a hurry for the place is just as it was left. The fellows helped themselves to the cellar & some had more than their share. At night we made a fire in loft and had several extra articles to eat, for the canteen has at last come to light. Our bread ration is very small, so the Army Biscuits are sort after very eagerly. Had a good sleep after travelling so much. How long we will stay here is the vital question.\n","129":"\n\n\"Reveille\" went about 7 AM so we are not feeling too bad. Owing to muddy fields we just fed up. After breakfast the animals were let loose in an adjoining field to graze. They acted like school children just \"breaking up\" for Xmas Holidays, the antics of some\n\nwere humorous. The day has cleared alittle. They have given us a half day off owing, I suppose to it being Easter Sunday, yet to us, it is hard to distinguish one day from another. The Hun put a couple over in the village at dinner time so has the right range. This will mean, we will have to evacuate to another position. From the hill you can see Albert and our shells bursting. The 3rd Division did good work yesterday and captured 3000 huns. The latter were surprised to see the Australians down here, thinking that they were at Ypres still. Wrote a few letters but cannot post them. as they have no time to censor them.\n","130":"\n\nNot raining so much now. Grooming mules till 10 AM when all the new hands had to pack up and\n\nstart out to the Australian Dump at Contay. About fourteen of us; put our Kits in the waggon, so just had a nice walk of about two miles to the dump. During the afternoon we packed up shrapnel and H.E., & at the finish had sore hands & weary limbs. Fritz put a few shells over in close proximity to us 50 % being \"Duds\" owing to soft ground. Had a read at night and received four letters, first since being up here.\n","131":"\n\nUp at 8 AM and started on the Dump. Had breakfast then worked solid till lunch. Our meals, however are not sufficient for the Hard work we have to do, but of course cannot complain. How often we wish for half the luck to Have a good meal in Sydney and a big look at the old familiar\n\nstreets. Had a wash today so at last look alittle like myself again. This part of front seems too quiet to last. Had a look over a couple of tanks just ready to go up. They are much smaller than original tanks, but do twelve miles per Hour having two .45 Horse power machines. They Hold three men and driver having four machine guns in them. They are used in open country for they are not climbers like the larger tank. It is lovely weather again.\n","132":"\n\nSorting out the Dump still. Have H.E. on one side and shrapnel on the other. Alot of Gas 4.5 came in. It is hard work but we like being away from the Section. Fritz generally sends presents over each day at the same time, & in the same spot.\n","133":"\n\nOn the dump as usual. Much ammunition is being taken out. This sector of Line had a \"stunt\"\n\nand held Fritz back successfully, although they suffered many casualties. The Artillery also received many casualties to both men & horses.\n","134":"\n\nGetting all the empty cases packed up. At night went on guard and was kept busy with numerous waggons coming forshells. About 40,000 shells were taken in the two days.\n","135":"\n\nOn guard during the day. Still taking the ammunition away, as I believe we are going over the top tomorrow. At 4 PM we were all warned to go back to our sector, which we did. We then received two days rations &\n\nreported to Divisional Headquarters about half a mile away. Here we received letters and my luck was in for I received four letters from home and of a late date (20 Feb). They came C\/o Col Atkinson. \nAt\nthis place we were sent to Batteries, so by wording the W.O. he let mates keep together so Pink & I are in the 39th Battery 10th Brigade. Four others 31st Reinfts men are in it too. Reported to the waggon line near tea time & billeted in a Barn. It is not far the D.A.C and about 6 kilometres from the Battery.\n","136":"\n\nExempted from early morning parade so had an extra Hour's sleep. The food is not too bad for up here. attached to \"E\" Sub temporarily, so groomed\n\na \"Donk\" each. They are not very regimental here, so it is goodo. A Corporal runs it, so we have a good time. The weather is lovely plenty of sun. A couple of shrapnel shells burst over the Horse lines, but no harm was done. A horse was killed yesterday, and a few wounded.\n","137":"\n\nUp at 6.30 AM but had little to do before breakfast. The ground is now soft and walking is very heavy also socks & boots are saturated. Packed our Kit and moved to a new billet about five hundred yards up. Had to move all personnel, so had plenty to do. At the end of one of these \" perfect Days\" we were tired, wet & covered in mud, \"Somme Mud\" at that. We are now in a barn, guaranteed not to leak?\n\nReceived another letter from Bess. Also photo of family. The 2nd Division are coming up this way.\n","138":"\n\nWe are situated at Behencourt a small village. Cleaned harness alittle and had an easy day altogether. Wrote a few letters at night.\n","139":"\n\nCleaned the lines up a little. After tea, looked Will Chapple up at the next village for\n\nhis Battery is Billeted there. He looks well. All the Australian Divisions are up this way now, so may see others I know. The forward Waggon Line came down here tonight owing to them having such a strenuous time standing to.\n\nThursday ","140":"\n\nWashed a couple of Waggons down at the creek near by. There are many\n\nstreams about this district, and are used for driving the water mills. Fritz has left us alone for some time now. It is very quiet here.\n","141":"\n\nA beautiful day to day real typical Australian weather, having little to do, we enjoyed sitting out in it. Had a game of football at night.\n","142":"\n\nExtremely cold and windy, so did little work. You can see by the last few days we are having an easy time. Much traffic is passing at night. Fritz came over in a number of Gothas, Passing over head. They went through a Barrage of shrapnel and Lewis Gun fires, without a mishap. It is a lucky shot that hits a vital spot. They made towards Amiens, at present a great attraction for Fritz.\n","143":"\n\nDid little work this morning, & in afternoon had a holiday till 4 PM. Being extremelycold we kept the fire in the Barn warm. Wrote a couple of letters. A couple of planes came over but did no damage.\n","144":"\n\nWashed waggons most of the day. After 5 PM we strolled down to D.A.C. to see some of the 31st Reinfts who are at present attached there. Had alittle luck at the Canteen also.\n","145":"\n\nWent for a bath today. First since Le Havre, over a month ago. We all enjoyed it immensely as you may guess. Hardly knew each other after it. They give you a clean change of clothes if you want them, the chats still stay in there however. The Gun teams had stiff\n\nluck, for Fritz put over about twenty 4.2\" H.E speculators, and they landed in the Horse lines, Killing two men & wounding seven, also several mules were killed.\n","146":"\n\nDoing odd jobs around the Barns and cleaning up a waggon. It is a perfect Home here, and has lasted longer than I had anticipated. Howevererelong we will come a cropper & will go up to the pits. Received two letters from Aussie today.\n","147":"\n\nReceived ten Australian letters so was busy reading them, getting all the latest news. Did usual camp fatigues, which are very few and petty, so find the days occupied in telling yarns ortalking of the present situation. Rumours are very numerous about here\n","148":"\n\nWashed and oiled limbers all day. The weather is now alittle warmer, and shows signs of clearing up.\n","149":"\n\nCleaned harness etc till dinner. then detailed to go up to the Headquarters of Battery with three others. Rode a horse each so the four kilos or more were soon left behind. Reported to C.O. and found our job to be a guard over ammunition in our reserved position pits. between Henencourt & Baijeux. Went back to the forward waggon lines, having tea & leaving our Horses there. Fixed up a dugout near the dump and salvaged a few blankets, Did guard in our turn, but did not have much sleep owing to fierce barrages of a six inch Battery alongside, also the nerve racking sound of the Huns shells wailing overhead & the\n","150":"\n\ninevitable explosion. Several came too near throwing debris onto road. Needless to say we Kept our \"Headsdown\". Had meals at the Battery so we were lucky, for our rations were down at our lines. In the afternoon Fritz put a few salvos over near us, and two 4.2\" shells landed on the road alongside our dugout, wounding two of the party severely. One went into a chaps left lung & he was just pretty near finished. I bandaged up the other fellow who got a good Aussie, getting it in the groin & knee. Luckily an ambulance was passing so they took them to the Dressing Station. We left here for our natural and got our horses, reporting back to our waggon lines. \"We didn't arf go\" as a Tommy would say.\n","151":"\n\nDid usual camp fatigues. Weather is now much milder Received a couple of letters.\n","152":"\n\nCleaned and oiled a few waggons There is very little work to do. At night I generally write or have a strole down the village. Turn in pretty early.\n","153":"\n\nStableman today, so had a read most of the day. Wrote letters at night.\n\nThursday ","154":"\n\nOiled a few limbers. In afternoon the lads took a half holiday but the Capt gave it to us half an hour afterwards. Wrote letters & chatting in the sun is a necessary work on half-holidays\n","155":"\n\nJack Jacobs came up to see me at night, so we had a long talk together. he is getting into same Battery. Received a few snaps from England, taken while at Heftsbury camp. They have turned out well.\n","156":"\n\nDetailed with four other chaps to relieve up at the guns. Not sorry in away, as the Major & B.S Major have made waggon lines regimental. Am attached to E Sub, the same as Pinkerton. Have a good dug out, there are four of us. the Corporal is very decent. At ten we had to unload ammunition. Up at 4AM with the No1. Fired twelve salvos onto one target. I set the fuses and loaded. Finishing this we fired fourteen H.E at another target. He let me fire these off, so was delighted to have had a shot at the Huns.\n\nthe gun makes some noise and flash. Have to block your ears. Finishing the shoot we \"stood to\" til 6AM. When we again turned into bed.\n","157":"\n\nHad breakfast in bed. Afterwards took a few shells over to the gun. In afternoon had a sleep. On guard at night and was lucky in drawing first shift. It is an S.O.S guard. have to watch for the signal from our Sector. Guns did a shoot at 8:30PM till 10PM. Had a good sleep till morning.\n","158":"\n\nGot the breakfast forthe sub, which stayed in bed till 12:30PM, as the day was wet & windy. The mud is awful .Our cook house is in the village some distance from the guns. It is unhealthy in any village. This is no exception to Fritz shells.\n","159":"\n\nSleeping is the chief item here, as we do all the shooting at night, generally from 8.30PM till 11PM. Last night we sent over a few good rounds. I am now an expert at firing. The weather is very dull, and ground muddy.\n","160":"\n\nHad breakfast in bed. It is very cold and windy. Got up at 11.AM and packed our Kits as we are pulling out from the position tonight, being relieved by the Tommy Artillery. Handing over cancelled for twenty four hours, owing to traffic on the road, as Infantry are changing over. The Tommy officer who us taking over from us, came this afternoon. A typical pictured officer with unnatural speech, binocle to eye, and a poor horseman, would not even ride down a four foot\n\nbank onto road, but went down some yards onto same level as road. One of the boys said, he was going to sleep in his boots tonight as the Tommies were holding the front line. This gives you the general idea of what \"Aussie\" thinks of his English friend as a fighter. Our Infantry have asked for the A.F.A. to be allowed to cover then in the new positions taken up.\n","161":"\n\nIt is a lovely day; plenty of sunshine, none of us woke up till 10.30 AM, so missed breakfast. However we were in time for dinner. We are not moving out till tomorrow now, orders having again been altered. Wrote a couple of letters Home.\n","162":"\n\nUp at noon and packed our gear for moving out. It was a lovely day\n\nPulled our guns out at 8.30 PM the Tommies taking over the position. Had to walk to the Rear Waggon Lines. Had a lift apart of way. Pulled out from here and travelled all night Keeping in close touch to the Line. Rain came down to torrents making things just anyhow for everyone. The darkness was intense.\n","163":"\n\nArrived outside Amiens about 5 AM and could see the city also the fine Cathedral which stands out prominently against the city. we pitched camp outside Amiens, having breakfast. The position being too exposed we moved out soon after to a bank near the railway line. Here we made dug outs & horse lines. being very tired we all\n\n\n\nslept anywhere till dinner. The Heavies are very busy in this sector. Made a dug out large enough for the five of us, but owing to the shortness of light we could not make it waterproof. went to bed with the sky very clear, but at 2AM we were washed out, so had a wet time till \"Reveille\"\n","164":"\n\nDid usual work in horse lines till dinner time. Fortunately the sun came out, so we dried our blankets & clothes. also made our dugout seaworthy. Had a good sleep at night.\n","165":"\n\nThe Major is swinging \"his weight around\" and makes the days work extend from 6.30AM till 5.30PM, also extra duties to do at night. The men are up against it but can do nothing. He is certainly a poor specimen of a man. Received\n\nten Australian letters today, so feel contented. Was on guard from 10PM till 2AM\n\nTuesday ","166":"\n\nCleaned the horse lines out and put in time generally. After parades we went into the River Somme which is only a hundred yards away for a swim. It was lovely. A few \"Aussies\" had salvaged rowing boats, and you could see them merrily going down stream as it it was at National Park or any other pleasure resort. The country around is very picturesque, and these lovely warm days, makes you wish to be back home to our local pleasure grounds.\n","167":"\n\nMade a Bomb proof shelter around the horses, owing to the Gothas liking this spot. particularly the railway nearby. He dropped four bombs this afternoon\n\nabout four hundred yards away on the \"points\". The French Naval guns near by had a premature burst which Killed a few men in the 110th Horse lines. They are nine inch guns.\n","168":"\n\nTook horses grazing till dinner time. In afternoon with two others I went to Brigade Headquarters with remounts. Going Along the road a Naval Gun of Fritz's fired the shell landing in close proximity to us. Of course we went as fast as the Horses would go and having no saddle on, made us pretty tired. It is a lovely day, quite warm.\n","169":"\n\nClean up stables in morning in afternoon went swimming in the River for an hour. It was alittle cold but enjoyed it thoroughly. Wrote a few letters\n","170":"\n\nHad half holiday on account of the Battery Sports which were held in the afternoon. The chief items were tug of war on Horse back when many strenuous goes were witnessed, Cock fighting on horse back, not the least amusing was the Donks High jump. Some of these intelligent brutes managed their two front feet over and there stayed. However an E Sub Donk named \"Aussie\" won by jumping near four feet. a good height for a mule with no practice. The Sports ended up with a \"Donks\" race; the field being two large to pick out a favorite. It was a pleasant break from camp routine and all enjoyed it.\n","171":"\n\nGuns went into action near Villiers - Brettoniaux at 2 PM, I did not go up with our gun, but\n\nwill be on next relief. There is plenty of work down at Waggon Lines to Keep you going all day. Fritz came over at night, and dropped two bombs near by. We rebuilt our dug out, making a general improvement on it. Worked hard today so enjoyed a good sleep till Reveille, of\n","172":"\n\nWhen all horses were watered. The stream is only a few yards away yet we have to go around about three quarters of a kilometre to it, as a reserve trench is in between & barbed wire entanglements. Rain came on in afternoon making things dismal for all.\n","173":"\n\nBeautiful sunny weather which we all enjoy. Have left off wearing woollen goods now. In the afternoon the River\n\nSomme is well patronised by all.\n","174":"\n\nMade the Bomb proof shelter higher but the weather is too hot to work, so we enjoy sitting down, having a sun bask. Had a swim in the evening The teams went up to the guns with ammunition at night. The Guns are in good position I believe, although Fritz has put a few \"Heavies\" amongst them\n","175":"\n\nFritz is very busy in the air and kept us awake a good part of night. He dropped a large number of Bombs around us. The Heavies too came dangerously close to our lines. It is perfect weather.\n","176":"\n\nHad the usual work to do in Horse Lines, in afternoon went down for\n\n\n\na swim and met Major Holmes A. Court and Major Kennedy in swimming. I was very pleased to see the former as he is such a good fellow. He was on the \" Karooka\" as Adjutant. Had a talk for a good time the swimming was good not too cold.\n","177":"\n\nBeautiful Hot weather , much like an Australian summer day. Have to do Mounted Orderly for Brigade today. Reported over to the 37th Battery and stayed for twenty four hours. had two small trips during that period.\n","178":"\n\nHalf holiday; so went down for a swim with the boys. It was lovely in. Wrote a few letters at night and played a game of cricket with improvised bat and ball. A tin Hat was the wicket.\n\n\n","179":"\n\nCleaned the lines up generally, In afternoon had my boots mended, on the \"While You Wait\" system having no others to out on. This took all the afternoon. Had a swim at night.\n","180":"\n\n\"Reveille\" went at 2.45AM when we had to \"stand to\" as word had come down that Fritz would hop over most likely about dawn. Harnessed all teams in readiness to \"tootsweet\" if he came. However the \"Barrage\" put up by our guns, evidently made him change his mind, so we watered our horses about 5AM, cleaned the Lines and had Breakfast. In afternoon we had a few hours off so all went in for a swim till 4PM. It was glorious in a lovely out. The weather is perfect; a cool breeze makes the warmth of sun pleasant.\n","181":"\n\nTook a couple of horses out grazing in the morning and had a sleep. In the afternoon cleaned up the Horse Lines; finishing up with a swim in the river.\n","182":"\n\nDid the usual camp fatigues and at night wrote a few letters. This sector is very quiet today.He only put over two shells near by. Wrote a couple of letters The weather has changed a little to the cool side.\n","183":"\n\nDid the same camp fatigues, & built up the Bomb Proof around the Horses. This sector is very quiet today. We are getting a new kind of glass eye pieces in our Gas Mask Supposed not to smear.\n","184":"\n\nHad a half holiday in the morning so put the time in reading. At dusk, three of us went about a kilo down the railway to a large deserted vegetaable garden, and salvaged a bag of Lettuces & Eschallots After doing this we had an interesting half hour looking at a French soldat catching frogs. He has a rod and tackle, with four small hooks at the end, and on the end of the line a light peeble which he skips across the pond. The frog seeing this moving immediately followes and when on top of the hooks he pulls the rod back, catching the frog easily. For the time being he puts it on a wire with the others already caught. When the frogs are on the surface of pond a lead weight is substituted for other peeble. He then adopts the method\n\nof dropping the weight alongside the frog, submerging the hooks under the frog. A quick pull up does the deed. They only eat the Hind legs which are fried. The frogs appear to be of the usual size & Species to those in Australia. At night our guns gave the Hun a fierce bombardment lasting over two Hours. The weather is misty\n","185":"\n\nDid the usual work in stables. Had the afternoon off, so wrote a fewletters. The weather is changeable.\n","186":"\n\nCleaned the limbersup, and had an easy time. Warned to go up to the Pits tonight. A good number are changing over tonight. Received one letter only. Arrived at the Pits about nine and after a look at the gun turned in.The digout is immediately \n\nbehind the gun. At 11Pm a shell landed five yards from dug out, filling it with dirt and smoke. Another came close, shortly afterwards, so we left and went to a flank. Came back 30 minutes after & turnedin for a while, but he shelled again, so we slept in trenches a couple of hundred yards away. Coming back at four AM, he landed a 5.9 ? afew yards in front of us. We fell on the ground so no one was hurt. Arrived at dug out and waited for daylight. He had the \"wind \" up us completely.\n","187":"\n\nHad breakfast at 9AM, then tried to sleep. He put a few more shells over at intervals of 30 minutes or so. Five of our 'planes and the same number of Fritz's \"boxed on\", the latter getting the best of it. It is fine weather. Had a quiet night which was muchly appreciated\n","188":"\n\nThe Padre came around and had a talk to usabout news in general. Had a lecture in afternoon concerning Battery in open Warfare etc. Wrote a few letters. Received about eighteen Aussie letters, so was set for the night. Fritz put a few coal boxes over us (shrapnel) pieces came very close. We were sitting in dug out having tea when one piece came into the centre of our group cutting one chaps pocket and its contents. He put a good number of gas shells over at 4AM till 6 AM.\n","189":"\n\nArose early and had a clean up Then wrote letters and cleaned the dug out. On guard at night, was lucky getting first shift. The weather is good and Fritz quite idle.\n","190":"\n\nHad a little sing song in dug out. A 'plane evidently was caught in some wind about 10,000 feet up, breaking his both wings off at body. He took some time to get down, being up at such a height. Whether he was a Fritz, French or British none could say. He would be dead ere reaching the groundThe wings took about ten minutes to come down. Fritzy is ranging today and is not far out. Just put a Gal Bose (Shrapnel Shell) over the Battery. Men went to their dug outs like rabbits to a burrow. We are pulling out in a few days time.\n","191":"\n\nNothing worth noting happened during the day. The usual amount of shells sent over to us by Fritz. E Sub doing shoot for the night.\n","192":"\n\nUp at 3AM and fired off shoot till 5.30AM. At 4 am Fritz put over numerous gas shells making working of gun awkward, having to put on Gas Respirator. Most of shells contained sneezing gas which is also a lachrymative making my eyes water for some time. He put a little Phosgene over also.\n\nHad breakfast at the pits then came down to waggon lines. Had a swim and a talk to three old 31st Reviftsboys, being pleased to see them. The guns were pulled out about noon,the 27th Batteryrelieving us. They have just been out for a couple of weeks monouvres at Abbeville. Received a parcel from Home. contents soon disappearing. Splendid weather. Fritz put some large stuff on Railway & roads near by about 2PM\n","193":"\n\nRolled our overcoats and kits, (of course in regimental style) we are now out of action, hence the extra attention of windy officers, scarcely seen when in action. Moved off at 7.30AM. Our Battery led the Column so did not have many unnessary halts. passed through the outskirts of Amiens, which is very much destroyed by shell fire. The travelling was hot and roads dusty. The only village passed throughof any size was Piquegny. Halted along road for lunch and at 4PM pulled into open field for night. The both Brigades are close together. Not many old chaps who came over with the 31st Reinfts. The country around is very fertile & picturesque. France constantly has fine avenues of trees. Went for a walk after tea with Pink. Many chaps have been evacuated with effects of gas. Slept out in open.\n","194":"\n\nReveille at 5 AM. Pulled out onto road about 7.30 AM, passed through Airames; the largest town passed during route. Typical of the French villages. The French :Soldats: are in larage numbers about here. Had dinner about noon. The country passed through is well cultivated and very undulated. Small forests are numerous. Arrived at our camp which is in the village of Cocqueral eleven miles from Abberville. Our lines are on the crest of a hill from which a panoramic view of surrunding country can be obtained. The Somme River is close at hand. We are billeted in barns.\n","195":"\n\nPhyical Drill from 5.30 AM till 7.30 AM From 9AM till ! PM we had Battery manouvres in open field. Not too\n\nmany know much about the movements from officers- down. Had a half- holiday, so went down to the Y.M.C.A. and had a read. Watered the horses at 5PM. After tea Pink and self went for a walk to neighbouring vilage, three and a half kilometres, by name Pont Remy about eight times the size of the village we are billeted in. Has one main street and a few shops. The River Somme passes through the villge. A few Americans could be seen; they are mating up with the Australians O.K. As usual many Australians were \"full\". Met Jack Jacobs and a couple of other Liverpool chaps, so we strolled through the village together. The 11th Brigade is a good distance from our village . The weather is fine.\n","196":"\n\nWatered the horses till Breakfast Had Battery manouvres again. The three Batteries were out together. Events passed off much better, than on previous day. In the afternoon a Tammy Sergeant gave a lecture on the Buffer and how it is worked. This is an air Buffer which takes place of the oil one. It is less expensive & more serviceable when firing at a long range. Did not go out at night.\n","197":"\n\nHad a rehearsal of Divisional Parade about noon when General Burges who is in charge of 4th Division F.A inspected us. The movements went off successfully, two Brigades being present. Had a supper at night with Pink & a couple of other chaps. It was a pleasant change\n","198":"\n\nHad a stroll around town in morning doing a picquet. Did not overwork ourselves. Had the afternoon off but did not go out\n","199":" ","200":"\n\nOn guard all day. The Division was inspected by Generals Birdwood & Monash. Not feeling too well.\n","201":" to","202":"\n\nWent down to a Rest Hut. Have some kind of French Fever. About a hundred in Brigade are down with it. On Wednesday Divisional Races were held. I believe it was chiefly an Officiers show. Still have a temperature.\n","203":"\n\nBrigade Sports are being held today. The Doctor evacuated me today to a British Casualty Clearing Station.\n\nat Longpre, about eight kilometres from Battery. The No of C.C.S. is 12. Had a good time here, good food and plenty of rest. The wards are full of Influenza. Got up after a few days here. Left on","204":" for the line. Came as far as Pernois for the night, Billeting at a Rest Station.\n","205":"\n\nCame back to our Divisional Wing Headquarters at Bertrancourt. Had dinner here. Achap from 39th Battery is also here so we went through this village. It is very slow and nothing to see. Came back and turned in.\n","206":"\n\nWent down to theGas School and issued with a respirator. In afternoon we fixed up a Tennis Court. The 5th Division Concert Party, \"Kookaburras\"\n\nbynamed are showing in this village there They give a good show. A large number of Infantry came into the night, also a few Artillery.\n","207":"\n\nWent down to Gas School again with the crowd and had a lecture on various gas. At night we went to the Y.M.C.A. Cinema Show which was very good.\n","208":" 1918,\n\nMoved off with the Infantry towards the line doing in all about twenty kilometres for the day. We were all footsore when the march was finished. Stopped at Rest Camp near Vaux. This village is dead.\n","209":"\n\nAbout six of us moved off about 5.30 AM so as to miss the party\n\nas we could not walk too well, being very stiff. At 7AM we arrived at Amiens 8.6 kilos and immediately caught Motor Lorries to Querrie 12 kilos away. From here we made numerous inquiries as to location of our Brigade. At 10AM we arrived at Battery which is on outskirts of Daours. The Orderly Room have sent all letters of mine into Hospital so will have to wait an indefinite time for them. All my Kit is also lost so Im not too Happy. Pink managed to save six letters for me. Fritz \nHe\n shelled about this vicinity at night.\n","210":"\n\nMess Orderly for the day, so assisted the cook. On guard at night. Pink is also on. E Sub Gun was knocked out by a direct hit. The Sub Section came down tonight. Aeroplanes are very active.\n","211":"\n\nThe Gun came down early this morning. A 4.2: H.E hitthe right wheel. The Buffer is blown about, shield & Dial Sight also smashed. The weather is fine. The waggon Lines are situated amongst tall trees, with a fine stream close at hand.\n","212":"\n\nCleaned the camp up and loaded the limbers with ammunition. Had half-holiday so played a game of cricket till 4 PM. Wrote a few letters.\n","213":"\n\nDid usual work or loaf in Waggon Park. The weather is too fine to work hard consequently little is done until an Officer appears & then all start \"tootsweet\".A stunt is coming\n\noff in a few days time. The traffic on road is enormous. Limbers after Limbers file in and load up, at the dump opposite, motor wagons hurry past riggling through the congested traffic. Os Ferns came around to see me tonight. He looks well but much older. We had a great talk for about three hours. He is camped the other side of this village; where his Battalion is out resting prior to going in the line and over the top. Went up with the waggons at midnight, a gunner has to go on each limber in case a driver is wounded or killed to take his place or give assistance. Fritz has the position of Battery very well and puts them right onto them when he likes, as he has direct observation from a higher hill close by. On\n\nleaving the main road onto the wheat field,. You have to travel about two kilos over flat country & owing to Fritz shelling it persistently the drivers have named it \"Windy Flat\" as it puts the \"wind up\" all. There are numerous shell holes on this track and the gunner gets a rough ride, behind some of the drivers, the springs on the limbers never seem to work. It is a case of hang on a hope the limber doesn't go over. The moonlight however has eliminated a good deal of the going into shell holes.\n","214":"\n\nUp as usual and watered horses. Cleaned up camp and made bomb proof shelters for horses. The day has been beautiful. Os Femscame around tonight and we had another\n\nlong talk. They have a platoon of \"Yanks\" in each company, as we are very much under strength in our infantry Battalions. Os said they are fine fellows, keen and fine physique. They should acquit themselves well. Fritz blew out our water-cart; killed both horses & wounded the driver in both arms. He put three \"duds\" in front of F Sub Gun. Poor left section is in for a bad time when the stunt opens out. The chap who was wounded on 21st April from this Battery had stiff luck, dying of his wounds received. He died in England.\n","215":"\n\nDid usual work in morning building Bomb proofs for horses. Did not overwork ourselves. Had a half holiday till 4 PM when\n\nthe horses had to be watered. Warned to go up to the gun as it came back today. This was cancelled at the eleventh hour instead I went on guard. The \"Hop over\" started at 3 AM when all Artillery commenced their deadly fire, a fire that takes nerve to face. The Infantry \"jumped the Bags four minutes afterwards when the Barrage lifted a few yards.\n","216":"\n\nFritz was surprised, the Infantry meeting raiding parties, and our chaps were in Fritz's line ere his Barrage opened out, thus the casualities were only half as many as suspected and all the objectives obtained in a couple of hours, with a couple of thousand Huns prisoners of war. The \"Yanks\" proved good fighters, and\n\nmany were too eager with the result that some were killed with our own shells. Three thousand yards was the greatestadvance although they could have gone on much further unmolested into a small village but orders are orders. The Huns who came to the cafe opposite our lines are a fine body of men as regards build and condition. Wounded Fritzs' were brought in with our own wounded. I had to go up to the pits with the water cart and a party of \"Yanks\" stopped us and said. \"Whydo you waste gasoline on those _______?\" pointing to an ambulance car with wounded Huns in. I told them Fritz generally gives our captured wounded good treatment. Our battery had no\n\ncasualities although the 38th had two detachments casualities. They expect business tonight when he counter-attacks. Had a hot bath today so feel fresh. The weather is still fine.\n","217":"\n\nDid usual work in morning, loaded the waggons with ammunition then Pink and self had a sleep for a couple of hours being tired, having had little sleep the previous night, owing to Fritz Bombing Planes picking out our waggon line surroundings as a fit place to drop somewhere near one hundred bombs over a couple of hours. Much to our surprisenot one bomb dropped in our camp area, although all around he put them. He dropped a good many flares. Went up to the pits at night to stay\n\nPink also came up.There are now only three gunners on gun,unloaded two waggons of ammunitions and carried shells to pit. Pretty hot work too climbing bank with four shells. He dropped a dud alongside gun at 11.30 PM. Fired sixty rounds off and at 3 AM another sixty, three rounds per minute. Turned in at 5 AM. A large House in Corbie near at Hand, caught fire and illuminated surrounding country up.\n","218":"\n\nUp at 9.30 AM for breakfast, then turned in till dinner at 2 PM. Had a clean up and wrote several letters till tea at 6 PM. He put over a little gas. We have a good dug out made by the engineers. Will hold four. On S.O.S guard from 11.30 PM till 1.45 AM. It was very quiet\n\nThe ammunition came up at 2 AM so helped unload and carry it to the pit. Had a shoot at 2.30 AM firing sixty ronds. Received about ten Aussie letters.\n","219":"\n\nUp for meals, could not sleep much during day. Wrote a couple of letters and had a read. A party came up from rear waggon lines to dig forward gun pits as we are moving up shortly. They are going to be in the reserve trenches. Had a sleep till midnight when we set the fuzes for the shoot. A raid was to be carried out on our left and we had to cover the flank. Fired one hundred and thirty odd rounds, three to the minute. It is hot dirty work. Cleaned the pit of empties & then unloaded waggons and carried ammunition to\n\nthe Pit. Had to be ready for an S.O.S.We evidently captured the few hundred yards in question as the stunt went off OK.Fritz did not counter attack.\n","220":"\n\nUp at 2 PMand cleaned up. Wrote letters till 6 PM & had tea. It is very quiet here today. Had a shoot at 10 PM sixty rounds as Fritz was bringing up guns,and they thought he would attack. It was a general shoot on all the sector. Unloaded the ammunition then turned in. Fritz is holding this line very thinly. It is believed he is waiting for men slightly wounded to return & men who have contracted this Dogs' Disease which is so prevalent amongst troops at present.\n","221":"\n\nRained a little today, but afternoon was dry. wrote letters till dusk.\n\nOn Guard from 1.45 AM till 4AM. Battery had to \"stand to\" for an hour ,as they thought Fritz was Hopping over. Did not have any shoot last night.\n","222":"\n\nWeather somewhat dull & showers have fallen at intervals. Wrote letters in afternoon. Did sixty rounds at midnight. General shoot. Waited for ammunition at 1.30 AM then turned in\n","223":"\n\nWeather is rather dull and had a little rain. Os Ferns sent a card saying he was wounded in the \"Hop over\" of 4th instant. Had a couple of small shoots at a couple of hours interval. Had to stand to from 3 AM till 4 AM.\n","224":"\n\nOn guard from 11.30 PM till 1.45 AM\n\nHad several shoots during the night. The planes of both sides were extremely busy, and the searchlights surrounding Amiens were kept going. They formed an unique sight with the numerous streams of light piercing the sky. It is very hard to pick a plane up at night.\n","225":"\n\nReceived photos taken in England last night. They are not too bad. Had letters from Maurice Hole a \"Karoola \" mate. Today has been uneventful. We are pulling out tomorrow I believe.\n","226":"\n\nUp at the usual time and in afternoon wrote a few letters, and had a read. After tea we have a rifle practice and the .303 bullets\n\nused number manf, so do the holes in surrounding . Had usual shoot at night.\n","227":"\n\nUp at 2 Pm when the third Division relieved us, taking over our gun and pit. We packed kit on a G. S waggon and came down to the waggon lines. Had a hot bath & played cricket at night.\n","228":"\n\nGetting up at 6.30 AM was very hard. Cleaned the Horse-lines then packed. Kit to go to relieve the 2nd Division. Saw a few 31st Reinftschaps at the lines, being in Battery that is relieving us. Left at 6 PM and after a long trip eventually arrived at the Pits. E Sub were lucky in not getting a Gunas it had gone to Ordinance for repairs. The positions\n\nis not too bad. We are in front of Heilly on Morlancourt Sector.\n","229":"\n\nNot much to do. The Battery fired a few rounds per gun at 11PM. Ammunition came up at 12 PM. Had to go over to Brigade to get the correcttime. Theyare in a large chateau. It is very old and the walls of ground are immense, being built for a seige in early days. It is the largest chateau I have seen. Had heavy rain for a while\n","230":"\n\nHad a read till dinner then wrote letters. The French seem to have defeated the Hun offensive in the south. Will Carswell came over to see me today, he is just a couple\n\nof hundred yards away to our left. Was greatly pleaed to see him, made Home seem much closer. He is very thin and fed up with the war. Four years is quite enough for anyone. Had a talk for a few hours. Our gun is not yet up. He shelled the gully a little in morning.\n","231":"\n\nPut the usual issue over in morning at 9 AM. They are all dropping about a hundred to our right. Pieces are numerous and dug outs \"favourite\". Not forgetting the old tin Hat. Did a little fatigue in the morning then read a book. In afternoon went over to see Will Carswell as they are pulling out at 6 PM tonight. Was pleased to meet him indeed. Ammunition came up at 10 PM when we carried a few rounds to our pit.\n","232":"\n\nUp at 6 AM having to go to Brigade with Intelligence Report. It is a three kilometre walk into Heilly where the Headquarters are situated. It was glorious walking amongst the wheat in such a lovely morning. The birds do not seem to mind the \"La Guerre\"carrying on. They chirp away to their hearts content. It is a pleasant sound to the ear; a peaceful sound after the continual cr-crash of all sizes of shells, and the report of our own. Had a bath in a bucket of water when I came back from Brigade H.Q. and then wrote a letter. The insects are a nuisance in this position, particularly by the mosquito & fly. Aeroplanes as usual are busy this morning. Had a read. Went to Brigade Headquarters in afternoon\n\ncarried up a little ammunition to the pit. Our gun did not turn up tonight so had a good sleep.\n\nSunday 21st July1918\n\nCleared the pit and helped on a dug out all day. Received a few Aussie letters dated up to","233":" Our Gun came up at 11.30PM but having no Dial Sight could not put in action. The weather is again cloudy\n","234":" July1918\n\nCleaned the gun up and put it into action.The carriage is old but it has a new bore. Wrote a few letters. The sun was good oh. Carried ammunition up at dusk. I had a night off as only two gunners are required to work it, the shoots being small and hourly\n\nThe gun failed to run up after a couple of shoots,so had to put it out of action again.\n","235":"\n\nHad the gun to pieces. The springs are too large for new spring case. Fired a couple of rounds 106 fuze (sensitive) onto dug outs. About five minutes afterwards. Fritz retaliated and sent over a dozen to us. They landed about fifty yards away. The news in paper is good concerning the Marne-Aisne Front.\n\nIt has rained heavily most of today. Put the day in sleeping. Did the shooting tonight. Had five \"shoots\" which meant staying up all night as there was an hourly interval between firing.\n","236":"\n\nHad a read and sleep to put the day in.On guard at night for an hour. Nothing occurred worth mentioning. Weather is still showery.\n","237":"\n\nCarried up & close on a hundred rounds to pit. It is extremely hard work, having to carry them close on one hundred yards up hill. A few trips soon knocks you out. Had six shoots during night. Had a sixty round shoot at 10 AM when we covered the right flank of a Hofover on our left. Used mostly smoke. Still dull weather.\n","238":"\n\nCarried up ammunition; twelve teams came up, so we expect\n\na stunt shortly. Had a night off and was not sorry, for it rained most of the night\n","239":"\n\nRained most of the day making the ground very slushy & hard to keep your feet. Sixteen teams came up tonight, so we had a busy hour. The Right Section did all shoots to night so had another night off. Received a parcel from London containing things I had sent over for. A mate also received an Aussie parcel and I helped him to get away with some of the contents.\n","240":"\n\nWent down to B.H. Q. this morning with despatch, E sub being duty sub. He put 4.2 salvos onto our Battery, thanks to the Woodbines who drew the crabs yesterday when\n\nthey worked at dug outs & pits under Balloon observation. We are getting all the \"overthrows\" which makes the posseyuncomfortable. The Left Section had to do the shoots tonight, Had three shoots of fifteen Rounds Gura Fireeach, so had competition with F. Sub. They won by a round as we had to push the gun up everytime. The rangers came out for ' the stunt' at 11.40 PM so we had to set to and set the fuzes\n","241":"\n\nThe Barrage opened out at 12.30 AM when all guns from Eighteen pounders to 9 inch spoke up. This lasted till 1.20 AM when we set to with the fuzes for next barrage which opened out at 1.35 AM. Our gun now being hot would not run up so three had to push it up\n\nmaking already Hot work much more strenuous. Our troubles started now for the wall of the pit fell in, and the camouflage also. Through these matters , we managed to send over one aminute. Hun planes came and dropped two parachute flares over the Battery. We soon Hugged the walls of pit waiting for bombs. The flares lasted about five minutes ( to us tit seemed like five hours). No bombs or machine gun bullets came so we set about the work again, although the thought of Fritz above never left our minds. He put over Gas shells at 4 AM, but we did not get much of it. Put a dozen shells over on our S.O.S.at 5 AM then \"stood down\". The operation was a complete success\n\ngaining 800 yards on 4000 yard front with slight casualties. Had a sleep, then a relief came up for each sub so came down to Waggon Lines about seven miles back near Freisancourt.\n","242":"\n\nWashed the Waggons down at creek in the morning then oiled them inafternoon. Had a swim down at creek, and it was a luxury indeed to me having had no bath for so long. Played the Tommies cricket in evening, who beat us by seven wickets. We scored 25 in first,108 in second innings, while they scored 80 in first.\n","243":"\n\nPut Hay sacks on Limbers in readiness to move out of here. The fourth Div Infantry have gone in at\n\nHangard south of Villiers-Brettoneaux just to the right of our position before going in at Morlancourt Sector. Have half holiday so wrote a few letters Home. It is fairly hot tonight. Fritz came over at 12.30AM and gave this locality more than its share. He came over in three relays, so we had little sleep that night. Of course we had the \"Wind Up\" completely. The troops hate the bombs; to hear the Burr-r of the machine,and the thought of bombs comiing onto you. He dropped several within one hundred yards of us.\n","244":"\n\nPut the morning in loafing. In afternoon washed the Gun Limber then disappeared. Fritz' planes came over at 3PM and set on fire four of our Balloons. The occupants of them came down \"tootsweet\" landing safely\n\nin trees. Had a game of cricket at night. We were easily defeated by the 54th AFA Battery. The Tommy Batteries are around ready to take over from us.\n","245":"\n\nRaining fairly heavy, so little work was done. Read most of morning. In afternoon wrote letters. The guns came down tonight. Was on guard from 4AM till 7AM.\n","246":"\n\nThe country is looking very well although the fields are gradually losing their colour and puts one more in mind of Australia with the Brownish grass. Packed the limbers and moved out at 2PM proceeding to Daows from where we had recently left. Pulled into a chateau grounds, made horse lines then put the covers up\n\nHad a good sleep. Ammunition went up, leaving it at a dump near Hamel. The guns are going into action close up to the front line, just for the stunt, so we expect a busy time. There are no objectives.\n","247":"\n\nUp at 6 AM and turned into stables. Had an easy day. Went for bath in afternoon. The chateau grounds are lovely with fine trees and stream running through. There is a tennis court but is minus Rackets etc. Wrote letters at night.\n","248":"\n\nDid work around camp, tied and packed loose bolts on the limbers so that Fritz will not hear them going up to the position. Packed our kit up ready to go up with the guns. Our gun came back. It is not\n\nmuch good. Wet weather has set in making things very miserable especially just before a stunt. The whole gun detachment was changed around at the eleventh hour. Military organisation again. Was glad that I never had to go up now as it was a wretched night. The range of gun for this stunt is 1500 yards. We are in front of Hambel near Corbie. Hundreds of tanks have gone up and they seem to have the bestfighting material in the way of men, for the Canadians, Scotch, Americans & Aussies are in large numbers. The whole five divisions are down for it.\n","249":"\n\nDid stables and had a rest generally. Put a bridge on E sub Firing Battery waggon to be put\n\nover Fritz's trench to enable the guns to advance over onto next position, which will be between the first and second Fritz lines. Rained fairly heavy during day. Went down to test the canteen stores, was not very successful. The stunt is coming off on the eigth. So rumour goes. F sub gun went up tonight.\n","250":"\n\nIt is a fine morning. Sunshine brings with it a differerent aspect on things, making me cheerful. Packed up the waggons and proceeded at 8 PM to the outskirts of the village of Hamlet going through the much battered villages of Aubigny & Fouilloy. Camped in a wheatfield till 4 AM. Did not sleep much owing to the cold.\n","251":"\n\nI am a runner in this stunt mounted on a bicycle. My first job was to proceed with Gun Limbers and Firing Battery Waggons up to the gun position some distance up. Travelling was most unpleasant owing to a dense fog. The Barrage opened up at 4.20 AM when all guns let loose their various sizes and kinds of projectiles. The \"Heavies\" close by smothered the noise of the Field guns. Hell on earth let loose, but what of where the shells were falling. After two hours of this tornado our guns moved up at the gallop to take positions in Fritz recent country. As the guns fired the Infantry boys cheered for we were well up near Fritz & I think it surprised them to think we were up so soon. I went back\n\nto the First Line Waggons which then came on through the village of Vaire-Corbie remaining till the order to move up still further. The fog was still very heavy, which although it assisted the tanks, Artillery could not get good observation. Our Brigade did a remarkable feat in getting into action some time before the Imperial Royal Horse Artillery who are specially trained for this open warfare, having suitable horses for light & quick work. At this position Fritz put over a few 5.9 making things uncomfortable. E sub gun went out of action here but was fixed up in time to join the Battery at another position further on about 8 kilometres from the old line. In the meantime the rear waggon lines came up taking its position in the old no man'sland.\n\nFritz had had no trenches; just advance posts and numerous machine gun positions. Our Infantry met with little opposition here. A number of Hun dead were to be seen. We had a look round their posy. Most had good dugouts. The dead had ghastly wounds, some without legs and many with half their heads blown away. This is my first experience of actual warfare, and these fresh sights will not be easily forgotten. The guns were now using open sights at 500 yards range on machine gun positions which were causing the Infantry a good deal of trouble. We blew the guns away but his Artillery on a height on the left flank poured enfiladefire onto our guns, causing much damage to the Brigade. We lost four killed\n\nand several wounded in our Battery the other Batteries fared much worse & 110th had tenkilled and the 38th over twenty. We pulled back from this position. Machine gun bullets came onto the position also, wounding a few men. Owing to the Tommies meeting with great opposition on our left flank near Chippilly we had to stop 1500 yards below our objective. The waggons were kept busy all day taking up ammunition to the guns. In the afternoon we suffered casualities among the drivers, several being wounded. Many horses were killed and several wounded. We captured eight Fritz's horses which were utilised in the teams. Four of these were killed later. Managed to get a few souvenirs. The prisoners are numerous and all appear to\n\nto be in good condition. Some are young. All seem pleased at being captured; perhaps the mere fact that they have come out with a whole skin is sufficient to make them that way. Our Light Horse did excellent work in advance, capturing a Brigade Headquarters and a large gun on railway. At night the Hun planes came over doing their evil work. They put the \"Wind\" up the troops more than anything else. Had a good sleep at night beiing very tired.\n","252":"\n\nThe Infantry had small local stunts but could not advance owing to left flank not advancing sufficient. Went to D. A. C. for a G.S. Waggon to go up to the Pits for the four chaps who were killed. They were burried\n\nat Vaire - Corbie with the rest of the Brigade. It being necessary that the left flank should advance,at 5.30 PM the English and American troops moved forward to the attack supported by tanks and a very heavy Artillery fire which we observed from a hill opposite. It was a great spectacle watching the Barrage. The fighting was very determined, the Huns having ideal defensive ground. The Height was soon taken, the enemy going towards Bray. Morlancourt fell to us after fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The Tommies a London Regiment lost Heavily on the Height overlooking Chippilly. They fought bravely unlike some English Regiments, although our Government has no room to speak about Germany sending\n\neighteen year old boys in the line. A number of guns were captured in this stunt.\n","253":"\n\nThings were very quiet this morning a small stunt took place at 10AM. At night I went up with F.B.Waggons to the guns, but when half way up met them coming away, as they had to take up positions on the left flank. Passed through the villages of Cerisy-Gailly and Chippilly, both being almost levelled to the ground. Ours and his Artillery had done their work. The streets were covered with debris from the buildings: dead horses and shell holes added to the congestion. Gas was noticeable in the village. Pulled alongside steep hill ( taken previous night) for awhile, then guns went into action on crest of hill. He put a\n\nfew over while we were waiting. Went back for another load bringing it up to the guns. We then returned to forward waggon lines near the guns Hun planes were again busy, and made us uncomfortable by dropping flares and sweeping machine guns around the roads. When watering horses one dropped two aerial torpedoes and small bombs close by. We thought our day had come.\n","254":"\n\nUp at 4AM and went up to the guns; thinking they were advancing the village had much gas in it. Stood by till noon then came down to Gun teams and unhooked. While waiting we went for souvenirs, but did not get much. The wood has many English dead in it, but few Fritz's. The former put up a brave fight for the\n\nHell. The lads are very young, and it brings home to one the horror of war; men, fit one minute and the next lying dead on the Battle field. It is the Home folk who suffer. Many 4.2 guns are here intact, and are being worked by specially trained men. These are the Batteries that caused us much damage through enfilade fire. The guns are excellent pieces of invention. Their range is over 10,000. Went up to the gun relieving. Fired a few rounds at intervals during the night. He put a few bombs over near by.\n","255":"\n\nAfter dinner we had to build gunpit up with sandbags. Worked till tea then told to be ready to move out at anytime. Put a Barrage over at 1.30 AM when the Infantry\n\nwent over after some ground. It was a success. Pulled out at 3AM returning to the Rear Waggon lines\n","256":"\n\nHad a sleep till 10AM then prepared to move out. Moved at 2PM proceeding via Lamotte and Guillancourt to Harbonnieres where we stayed for tea. The rear waggon lines are staying here. As no orders have been received to move out we pulled the waggons alongside a bank in case of Bombs. Dug in a bit of a drain & turned in. The Hun planes came over in numbers but did not drop any bombs near. Our searchlights make a fine sight sweeping the sky withtheir bright streams They got onto one plane but did not bring it down. Pulled out\n\nat 1AM, the guns and Firing Battery Waggons proceeding to the new position about 2000 yards in rear of the line. It was a long trip over the country,and to add to our being tired Fritz was strafing a good deal. Finally arrived at our position and unloaded the waggons, put the camouflage over the gun and looked for a dug out. After much trouble found one and turned in. He put over a barrage nearby but it did not trouble us much being too tired.\n","257":"\n\nUp at noon having breakfast then had a read. We have a good dugout, fairly large, with writing table and beds in it. Fritz lives well when he is at home. He shells this place a\n\na good deal. Formerly it was used by him as a Rear Waggon lines as stables have been erected and used. The surrounding country is very level with touches of bushes here and there. It is extremely hot today. Up to the present we have captured much material. Over a million bombs are in the village on left and we passed en route to position dumps etc. A couple of large guns could be seen on the road. Fritz used the railway to some extent. There is to be a large hop over here in a few days or they expect him to come over. We are a silent Battery being so close to front line, on our left is Bayonvillers and in front his Lihons. Lamotte is almost levelled to the ground being in a hopeless\n\nruin. There is not a roof on a house. The church has one part of wall standing. Dug pit at night\n","258":"\n\nWe were very tired from previous night's work. Digginga gun pit is hard work, and with the ever buzz of Hun's planes over head one does not feel extra pleased with himself. Fritz put over a very heavy Barrage at 3.30AM till 5AM keeping us awake sometime. The sentry failed to wake us up when gas came over, with the result all received a good deal of it, ere we could get our masks on. At night fixed up the pit and camouflage working till midnight. Our guns are very quiet and do not retaliate. The weather is very warm and dry.\n","259":"\n\nHe Put over some Barrage this morning, especially on the wood to our left, for in it is a large ordnance dump etc; twelve Aussies have been killed trying to get some sugar and other luxuries. There is 2000 ton of sugar, much Jam flour etc etc. Down on our right the French are busy for the rumble of both Barrages (His and ours) can be heard. The ground seems to shake or rather tremble under you. In the afternoon our Heavies woke up, and it was indeed a cheerful noise after such subdued silence. Since that Fritz has not sent so many over. To the righrt of Rozieres which is directly behind us, you can see ours and his shells bursting, the country being so flat They are only 2000 yards away &\n\nhave direct observation on our position, which makes it very unhealthy. It is rumoured the French have advanced so he may withdraw from here. We are on Sauterie Plateau the Infantry being in the old Somme trenches. A chap was saying that our Infantry are only a few yards away from Fritz and bomb throwing goes on to some extent. Even the dug outs are petitioned off by sand bags, both sides using it. (that is a large dug out). \n\nDid alittle to put in the way of sand baggingit. On guard from 2 AM till 3.30 AM. Fritz is fairly quiet. Shelled the wood alittle. Put three shells over near Battery at about 3AM two going well over but the third went right into a sub dug out, blowing one lad to pieces, and\n\nburying the others. I was standing five yards away doing guard, went down on prone and was covered with dirt. I immediatly went for assistance and we soon had them dug out. None were hit. It is marvellous the escapes you have.\n","260":"\n\nThings are very quiet in this front this morning. Weather is alittle dul. Dug some ammunition up in pit. Had a quiet day. Fritz not worrying us much. Had a good sleep till 4AM when we throught Fritz was hopping the bags. It was on our left.\n","261":"\n\nWrote several letters today. It has been windy & cold. Nothing of importance has occurred today. Fritz brought one of our balloons down about 4pm. Put more sandbags up on the sides of the pit.\n","262":"\n\nDid little allday except write a few letters and have a read. At 7PM we had an S.O.S. when we let them go at the toot. It lasted ten minutes only. Machine gun bullets went over our head with a Gipping noise. As the line is close on 2000 yards away, the flatness of country can easly be realised when bullets will come that far. We learnt afterwards that Fritz had made a raid also our Infantry. The Canadians are giving him a lot of worry. The rest of night was quiet.\n","263":"\n\nDid little work in morning. Wrote a few letters in afternoon. On guard for a couple of hours. Fritz was pretty quiet. A dense fog was on similar to morniing of stunt.\n","264":"\n\nExtremely hot during the day, at night we had to dig fresh pits which meant solid hard work till early hours of morning. Our army is certainly a Key stone with mug officers running it. They say keep under cover during day, yet they have an inspection under observation of Fritz's Balloon to see that you have had a shave. It is full moon tonight. Received much Australian mail some of June & May dates. They were exceedingly welcomed.\n","265":"\n\nFritz put a few salvos over this morning getting the cook. Stiff luck getting such an important man. It is very hot with little breeze so all feel more or less tired.\n\ncarried ammunition from old pit to new. Finished at 11PM and turned in till 4AM.\n","266":"\n\nHad a stunt at 4.50M when the \"Aussies\" on our left flank hopped over. The result I have not heard yet. He put a little H.E & shrap over us to no effect. Slept most of the day. One from each detachment went down in pill box. We are pulling out today I believe. Weather is rather dully.\n","267":"\n\nHad a good sleep last night. Fritz is putting a few shrapnel shells over us. Had a read. The waggons come up empty and loaded up at the pits, the last getting away about 11PM. Came\n\ndown to waggon lines through Rosieres. The French Infantry & Artillery are taking over from us.\n","268":"\n\nHad a rest till noon. At 2PM we moved out waiting at Giullancourt for the rest of the Brigade. We came to the outskirts of Corbie about 5PM passing through Lamont, Fouilloy etc. Corbie is a very large twon and although greatly damaged is crowded with Aussies of all the Divvies, evidently returning from the Base. In the square is to be seen two large Heavy Guns (about 8 inch) captured by the Australian Infantry on the 8th. Camped in field. Rained most of night although unpleasant it meant no bombing planes of Fritz's visiting us.\n","269":"\n\nOn the road at 8AM coming to the outskirts of Amiens, to a village of Camon about the usual size of a French village. We are camped about¾ Kilos out of village in a small bush or forest. Horse\\lines are already made so that means less work for us. Made a Humpy so we are set.\n","270":"\n\nDid usual work around the camp. In afternoon went in search of Canteens. Was not too successful. From our camp you can see the most of Amiens. The fields look O.K. with the Harvesting soon on and hay stacks in the making. Had an excellent sleep having extra blankets. They were very welcomed.\n\nWenesday","271":"\n\nWith five other chaps I went down to the village of Camon & cleaned out several Houses which are to be used by our troops as billets. It was a good easy job; we made it so. In afternoon obtained canteen stores for mess. Heavy gun fire can just be heard down here so guess Fritz is getting plenty of iron rations. It has rained alittle during day. Received a few letters from Home.\n","272":"\n\nOn fatigues all day cleaning up the camp, at night five of us went to see the","273":" Division Concert Party \"Smart Sets\" by name. They were very good and we put in an enjoyable evening. Saw Jim Brooks but did not speak to him.\n\nCleaned up the camp again. Quite an easy job the way we do it? Did my washing at night, a pleasant job, I don't think. The weather is perfect and rain has kept off so far. Wrote a few letters.\n","274":"\n\nDid usual fatigues during day and at night wrote letters. The weather is dull.\n","275":"\n\nThe gunners had an early breakfast and started out to the Hot Baths at 7.30 am. Had a brisk walk of a couple of kilos. The bath & clean clothes went well, we all felt like new men after it. In the afternoon another chap & self walked over to Longeau to where the Fritz guns\n\nare parked. It was a fine sight never to be forgotten. About two hundred guns in all, calibres ranging from 3 inch to 11 inch, also naval guns. The \"Minniewerfers\"? although they have an immense bore are small guns used in \"supports\", the work of these is mainly on machine gun positions. The next in size is the well known \"Pip-squeak\" a shell of about nine poundwith a sharp head. The Infantry see more of these than other units. Wizz-Bang\" a shell of 3 inch calibre is sent from a gun much like our own 18 pounder it being one of His field guns. The name is derived from the noise the shell makes whilst in the air, followed by the explosion. It is a \"toot sweeter\" that is comes very quickly. The next gun is the field gun 4.2 inch, most commonly\n\norder parade, a kind of rehearsal prior to the parade tomorrow. In the afternoon went as an escort with a chap to the \"clink\" at Daours but found Fritz's in it, so returned to Battery after a good ride across the fields. It was a nice time for a spin. It is very cold at night.\n","276":"\n\nHad an Inspection of Division by Major-General Sinclair McClagan who commands rthe","277":" Divie. He is an old guy, went passed in Column of Route, coming back through outskirts of Amiens. At night I went down into Camon & bought some canteen stores. The French work fairly late in the fields and have most of hay gathered in.\n","278":"\n\nHad gun drill all the morning. It is stale work. There was a sports meeting but I did not go being too tired. It was not much good. Turned in early.\n","279":"\n\nCleaned the camp up during the day and at night five of us went down to see the change of programme of the Smart Sets. It was splendid and we put in a good night. The programme was much better than on opening night.\n","280":"\n\nPacked up the gun gear ready to put on the limbers as there is a strong rumour of us moving up the line. At night Pink, Honey & self went to a Froggy joint\n\nfor supper. The eggs went well.\n","281":"\n\nReceived a rude awakening at 4 AM when the \"Reveille\" went. For the first half of it, I thought it was a part of a dream but soon I know the \"Dinkum Oil'. Packed the waggons with the gun equipment and our Kits then had breakfast. Moved out at 9AM proceeding via Daours, Corbie up to Mericourt near Bray. Pulled into a Gully, which had numerous dugouts of the first order built by Fritz. As we pulled in who should be waiting for me but Bob Forsyth. He is attached to Corps Headquarters, billeted in the\n\ngoing on Blighty Leave next week; he looks well although he has not grown at all, or altered. Have a decent bed. It is a shed with about fifty beds in it (wire netting) & table to eat at. Leading off from this is a large deep dugout. Shows Fritz thinks of his men more than our \"Keystone Army\". As long as you have a Bandolier on & chin strip down, you are O.K. Had a good sleep being tired after route march.\n","282":"\n\nReveille at 6AM when horses were watered. It is over three kilos to the river so took a good while. After breakfast cleaned stables. Jack McKenzie on old mate of mine who came over with the 31st Reinforcements came over to see Pink & myself. He\n\nis now in the Motor Transport Company, having left the 41st Battery the work being to strenuous for him; he being too old for the rough living & exposure to climatical conditions. We were glad that he got a comfortable position. He is a fine chap; had dinner with us then went back to his unit to get leave for the afternoon. He came back but we were busy packing the limbers \"per drill book\" as one of our Brainy Officer's said also. Owing to the new warfare Doug Haig said we must keep to the book as far as possible\". Thus equipment must go on in the exact way & in many cases, useful articles had to be \"dumped\". Men must not put their little bit of bread or rations neatly on the footboard of limbers.\n\nit must be carried where it cannot be seen. Thus our few little articles of food are packed in a small mess tin, the rest has to be \"dumped\" It is hard on us & things like this eat into our mind, making the feeling between \nmen\n & officers far distant & bitter. I counted as we moved out in the column the number of \"pill boxes\" ued for officers & Sgts kits. There were no less than four. These conained messing gear & rations & Kits. Five drivers were employed & about eight horses. How many Batmen, Grooms & Cooks - well :- John Bull's next edition may be able to throw light on the actual number. Bob Forsyth came down to see me today again, the Corps having not moved as expected. We went over to see the 15 inch\n\nFritz Naval Gun captured by the 3rd Battalion 1st Division A.I.F. It is the largest gun captured since the war began. Its immense size is hardly creditable, & as you look at the fittings & bed, the work that has been put into it. you are bewildered. There is so much to see at once that you pause to think which end you will start at. The Bore, like a small gun, has many riflings & the piece is over fifty feet long, has the inner tube then another layer 6 inches thick over that, again another & yet another so the thickness of piece is easily two feet to two feet six inches. The bed is of solid concrete & iron supports, the traverse of gun is about 100 degrees. It stands from bottom\n\nto top, a distance or rather height of about thirty to forty feet, having a huge steel platform around the Breech & in front. The shells are run up from a dug out to the Breech by a light Railway. They have built huge dugouts for the ammunition & shell cases. The gun is worked by electricity. Three lines run into the position which is in a small forest or wood. The gun has been blown up by the Firtz. They did the job properly. The piece is blown off near the breech, the latter is hard to find, being in many pieces. The bed is also in ruin. We came back to Corps Headquarters to see if I could find Alex Casserley who is now attached to the Corps. I had seen the 3rd Squadron on my way\n\nto the gun, so made inquiries about him. Had no luck at the Headquarters, he is not there. Suppose he went to London. Met Dob Cairns also. Gave Bobsome souveniers to take to London for me to send Home.\n","283":"\n\nMoved off at 8AM coming up nearer the line, passed through the old 1916 line. The country is very desolate, burrowed out with trenches and dugouts which are all 4.2 evidently winter quarters for the troops. The trees are just sprouting again although they are knocked about. It is partly this that makes the country look so barren with the bare tree stamps sticking up on the field. Pulled into a paddock near Herbecourt six miles from Peronne. The country\n\n\n\nis full of old shell holes, now covered with grass. In the afternoon we had to wash the waggons while drivers cleaned harness. This helps to win the war? Built a humpy & turned in. Rained heavily at night, our canvass letting a good deal in thus an interruped rest.\n","284":"\n\nCleaned horse lines. It is very wet and rain seems to have set in for some time. Will Casswell who is now on some wireless stunt with his Brigade happened to be near as we came along the road so I again had a yarn to him. They are being relieved by us. He looks well. Did little today owing to the rain. Was on guard at night over a prisoner; the night proved rather cool for that kind\n\nof a job. Received several Aussie letters which greatly revives one going or getting \"fed up\".\n","285":"\n\nTeams hooked in at 8AMN, Battery pulling out at 9AM. Came through barren country, ground that has been fought in time and again; the villages are villages no more, shells from both sides leave little standing, and one would pass along the road not seeing the village or knowing that one ever existed there, but for the signboard denoting name of village. The dugouts are numerous and each has a fireplace in it, evidently they were habitated during the winter of 1916-17. We travelled quickly in fact too much so for those who had to walk. The roads were muddy & weather\n\nvery unsettled. Fritz blew up many bridges & had roads mined near Peronne; this place now historical through fierce engagements of previous years is a Heap of Ruins. We left it on our left, proceeding in the direction of St. Quentin. Arrived at Moraucourt and relieved the 51st Battery 5th Division. Met several chaps whom I knew at Liveerpool. Capt Prior who was at Liverpool also when we were there is Adjutant of this Battery. E. Sub having no gun remained behind. The guns went into action about 4000 yards up, in a wood. Their S.O.S. range is 6800 yards. The Infantry have not come in contat with Fritz yet. Made a dugout. Rained fairly heavy all night.\n","286":"\n\n\"Revielle\" did not sound till 8AM owing\n\n\n\nto most of the men being out till late. Did several odd jobs about the camp, and made our dugout rainproof. However immediately after tea we had to move up as our guns have gone up 4000 yards. We arrived at the old position where the guns were & made a waggon line. Put up horse lines in semi-darkness also our dugouts. The rain added more to our troubles. Turned in at 11PM very tired. The teams came back about midnight.\n","287":"\n\nStill raining; the \"Heads\" did not know the watering points so after much delay they \"fed up\" without watering. Moved our dugout down to a better position. Loaded up the waggons with ammunition from the old position. Received letters at night from Aussie\n","288":"\n\nCleaned up the camp all the morning then had a read in the afternoon and wrote letters. It is still showery and rain seems to have set in. Cleared up at night however, so Fritz paid us a visit. Dropped some on neighbouring hill, close enough for all of us. Our searchlights got into two of them & they were brought down by one of the Artis' & the other by a plane.\n","289":"\n\nReceived a parcel from Home, also several letters. The contents of former were soon devoured, especially the sweets. On guard during the day & then at night went up to pits with ammunition, taking it onto forward position about 2000 yards from line. Came back to present gun position\n\n& reloaded taking it up to the forward position. It was a lovely moonlight night & Fritz was over, although not in large numbers. He dropped a few around, none coming near us.\n","290":"\n\nWatered horses & helped to clean harness. Fritz put a few shells along the road we go along to water, & made us go at the \"toot\". It is extremely hot today. Teams went up with ammunition again tonight. Received a little mail. Saw Joe Cooper he is in the Mobile .\n","291":"\n\nLooked after a couple of horses during the day. Joe Cooper came around to my dugout & had a yarn. He has not changed much, showed each other's treasures which consist of photos only. Just finished\n\nseeing them all when Fritz came over with Bombs. Lights out at the \"toot\" & on the prone. He put them near enough.\n","292":"\n\n\"Reveille\" went at 4AM when horses were watered and harnessed up to proceed up to gun positions. Left at 8AM & by 9AM wewere at thepits. The Barrage opened at 4.25AM but on our sector was very feeble. The infantry had little opposition for the first 3000 yards. Fritz did not send much back until early in afternoon, when he got near the new position of the Battery. Blew a team up. The gas proved a nuisance making many sick. I went up to the position & filled the limbers, & cleanrd the ammunition. We were then finishd for the day.\n\nso I was really a civilian in this stunt. Stayed at the dump for the night; all teams stayed there. He came over in large numbers with 'planes & seemed to like our position. He kept our heads sown for some time. The rain came on again so that prevented further visits.\n","293":"\n\nUp at 7AM harnessed up & came down to near waggon lines having Breakfast. The weather is still unsettled. Reiceived another issue of gifts from Australian Comforts Fund. Planes visited us at night.\n","294":" Did usual fatigues during the day and at night went on guard. It is still dull weather. Received mail from Home. It is getting cold at night.\n","295":"\n\nDid usual work at waggon lines, watered horses etc. & cleaned the limbers. The guns came out tonight. It is raining very heavy. Received several letters and answered a few.\n","296":"\n\nThe 1914 men left for Aussie today. From this Battery sixteen went, a good record. They were all in high spirits as can easily be imagined. They go via Paris & Italy, so will have a good trip. Received a parcel from home, with balaclava, cap etc. in it. It is a welcome gift.\n","297":"\n\nWe are going into action again in a couple of days. Alex Ingram came around to see me. He has not altered much, looks well. Had a long chat about Home. He is in 106 How Bty with Joe Cooper.\n\nplayed 17th Battery Rugby butthey won 13 to nil. At night cricket was played. The evenings are drawing in. A Hun 'plane had a go at one of the Balloons, but the \"Auties\" put up a good barrage & he came a \"gutzer\".\n","298":"\n\nDid the usual work. Am going up to the pits tonight. Pulled at at 6.30 pm. Saw Joe Cooper. We came to the left of old position by about ten kilos. Pulled up at waggon lines awaiting orders. After a stay of an hour or so the guns & waggons went forward passing through Roisela fairly large village much destroyed by shell fire. The officer lost us when in this village. We turned to come back, when a Fritz plane seeing us on he white road dropped\n\nseveral Bombs, causing us to hurry and put the \"wind\" up us to the highest extent. The teams galloped through the village, but when at the end of the village, he dropped more, they fell on either side of the road & we thought the whole issue of us were finished. Bombs - cut them right out in next war please - Finally arrived at our position, or near it. There was a little delay owing to Fritz shelling the position. Pulled into action & commenced digging pits. Finished digging at 5AM & slept in open tench till 7AM when I woke up with cold feet & a drizzling rain which slightly wet my posssessions. There are Tommies in trenches resting - mere boys of eighteen.\n","299":"\n\nFixed the camouflage on gun & made ammunition racks, stacked the ammo in pit. He has shelled the place all day. In front on either side & behind, so we do not feel too much at home. There are no dugouts just have a trench cover up & dug in two feet. Had a look at a British Bomber that came down a couple of nights ago. Fritz shells it a good deal. Ammunication came up at night two loads per gun. Turned in but Fritz kept us awake with his continual shelling. A piece came through the dugout hitting me on the arm, luckily it was spent. Bruised the arm somewhat. It was a piece of the base of a shell about three inch square. He put gas over in morning. The Yanks are now up here.\n","300":"\n\nUp at 9am for breakfast. Had a clean up, a very welcomed piece of work too. It is cloudy & rain is not far off. He is still shelling. Two loads of ammunition came up per gun. The Tommies in trenches left this afternoon, so we took a dugout in trench, which is much safer posey. He shells this far too persistently for my liking.\n","301":"\n\nUp at 5am as there is a stunt on at 5.30; the Yanks are hopping over after a few hundred yards prior to the big kick off in a few days. Advanced about 1500 yards but at 9am we had an S.O.S. Fritz put the Yanks back 500 yards. I believe the latter fought well.\n\nbut lack experience in consolidating their gains when they win. At noon Fritz got onto our battery getting a direct hit on C sub gun killing two & wounding three men. He has several balloons up quite close & could not help seeing us. There are so many batteries in small area & much movement on position. Ammunition came up a little earlier. Had shoots at frequent intervals during night. A couple of springs broke in our buffer but it was soon fixed up. He put gas over a night, getting a few men. One shell landed at door of dugout, putting the \"wind\" up us a good deal.\n","302":"\n\nFairly cool today. He still puts the shells over. At 9pm we\n\nmoved up into new position prior to the stunt. Our leader lost us on the way up, but eventually we arrived at position about 11pm when the gun was put into action alongside the road & near a village by nearLempire. Have a Yank engineer attached to each gun to assist. Had a few winks in a trench close by till 5.30 pm. The barrage opened up at 6am & fairly heavy at that.\n","303":"\n\nThe barrage went O.K. finish up at 9.30am, our range being 7300 yards having to dig trail in. He put a few 5.9 over during stunt. Had a sleep till about two. Did odd jobs, uncliping ammunition etc. Fired about 500 rounds in barrage. At about 4pm he opened up on our battery with 5.9 instantaneous bursts, putting all shells within\n\na yards square. Obtained direct hit on F sub gun & put several around it, also put two at the trail of our gun, but did not put it out of action. We huddle together in a small narrow trench, but even then he dropped them on either side of it. We had the \"wind\" up completely; personally it was the heaviest fire I have been under. Between the shots we managed to get away to a flank & it was a great relief too. No wonder the Hun prironers look so shell shocked coming back. It is a pity to see them in such a state. Found a dugout near a gun so the left section slept in there for the night. I was on guard from 12.30am to 2.30 am. The Yanks fought alright, but are inexperienced & did not mop\np\n up properly consequently when they advanced Fritz came out from behind with machine guns.\n\n& did some serious work. At night none knew where the line was. Our S.O.S. came down some 400 yards. The 3rd &","304":" Aussie Divisions came up & did good work in mopping up and finally made the flanks meet.\n","305":"\n\nHe has not shelled much this morning. Had a clean up & give guna little oiling. F sub gun went away today so we have now only four guns in action. Had a small shoot at 6pm. Salvaged an American Officers' Mess, so we had a few dainties for tea. Actually put sugar in our coffee ourselves, like old times alright. Had a quiet night. He put a few 5.9s over one falling at the entrance of our door, Plenty of gas in it too. It rained fairly heavy during night & was on the cold side.\n","306":"\n\nIt is a fine morning. Had a good clean up with hot water, so feel jake. He has not put many over today. It is raining a little.\n","307":"\n\nUp at 4am and moved out of position proceeding to our right to a village recently captured by name Bellicourt which is well over Hindenburg line. The subterranean canal is on our left rear. This is what held the adance up for a while, owing to large number of Fritzs' coming out at various parts & times. It was cleared however & the Infantry went forward towards St. Quentin. We dig our guns in under shell fire, but Fritz put the exact range on, so we left all & ran to a flank till he stopped. We are camped in a\n\nPill Box so it is fairly safe from 4.2 shells. One chap was wounded. We are getting fed up with this persistent shelling of position. The Major sent us all down to waggon lines, just leaving aguard there, as we are not responsible for an S.O.S. in this sector. It is some 5 kilometres to the W. lines and they are in a wretched position in a chalk pit.\n","308":"\n\nPulled out of this waggon lines & came over onto a hill some two kilos. It is now five kilos to water. Rather a long way? Slept out in a trench for the night. Rather cold. A few bombers came over.\n","309":"\n\nIt is very dull today. Am on no duty owing to being a little sick wrote letters. The gunners went up to the guns which moved three kilos\n","310":"\n\nThe waggon lines moved up on the left of Bellicourt, near the canal which forms a strong point in the Hindenburg line. There are thousands of horses in the vicinity, all having to water from one place. Guess the congestion & delay. The banks of canal are very precipitous & dangerous in wet weather. Numerous Hun dugouts are built into the bank, some have been burnt out by Fritz. A number of his dead are along these places. It is excelent ground to defend in this area. Camped on top of a hill in trenches. Have sunken road as horse lines. In front is a small village, it has not been knocked about much. A few civilians were found in these\n\nplaces. Land too had been cultivated up to recently. He came with usual amount of bombs at night.\n","311":"\n\nIt is extremely cold & wet. Did work in horse lines & managed to write a few lines home. Received a few letters from England.\n","312":"\n\nThe guns moved up a few yards today to a better position. He is not giving them too good a time up there. Very cold and wet. The weather seems to have broken, so we can expect a bad time ahead.\n","313":"\n\nReveille went a little earlier, owing to teams having to go up to pits, there being a stunt on. Cavalry have been going up all morning. Hope they can operate & get him.\n\n farm\n\non the run. It is very cold outside & one hugs what fire he can get near. Received a letter from Ireland today. The clock went back an hour.\n","314":"\n\nThe teams went up again, as the guns had to go forward. Fritz is evidently on the run. The waggon lines moved up at 5pm about 8 kilos to a village by name Brancourt, which was in the hands of Fritz the morning before. Arrived at the place in the dark per usual. Luckily it did not rain & Fritz's bombing machines were not busy in our locality. Had tea & \"turned in\".\n","315":"\n\nWatered the horses & then salvaged a number of vegetables for the cook. Put one in mind of a harvest\n\nFestival the variety that was collected. Fritz shelled us with 5.9 at various times during the day, getting three horses. A number of Yanks are along the bank waiting to move up the line. The guns went forward again about 6000 yards, Fritz having retired some distance. The waggon lines moved up past the old gun position going through ideal country not touched by war. It is a change to see fillages not knocked about by shells & the fields without a shell hole in them. Many French people are in these villages, having lived here under the Germans. The men have either been killed or sent back to Germany. Put up a humpy and retired for the night. The front line is only 3000 yards away, so the rear waggon lines are up fairly near.\n","316":"\n\nYanks hopped over this morning & are going well up to date. It is rather dull weather & cold. Horses are grazing all day so there is little work to do.\n","317":"\n\nVery dull & is cold. Horses were grazing all day again,so we also had a cool off. The village of Busigny is close at and. Collected vegetables for the cook. We are living well in that line. The village is not damaged by shells. Speaking to a French civilian he was telling us his experience under German rule for four years. Every civilian had to salute the Hun officers, by springing to attention & taking hat off. The Fritzs' lived on oats & potatoes & black bread, the latter\n\nis exceedingly bitter). The horses too form a diet for men, that is the worst portions of the animal. He also said that the men would not fight unless they were made & officers are always with revolver ready making them work. They treat prisoners of war very roughly too. He was glad to be free again.\n","318":"\n\nStill very cold & wet. The weather is breaking up fastly. Did little all day, having a complete rest.\n","319":"\n\nOn stable piquet today so had & cool off again. We are living very well on the French vegetable gardens, thanks to Fritz leaving them.\n","320":"\n\nDid little in morning, the four guns came back from Ordnance\n\n& went into action tonight. I went up on E sub. They are billeted in a house near the guns, have quite a Home & good sleeping quarters. Fritz spoilt the look of the house yesterday by putting a 5.9 on the roof. It is raining & cold. Received a few Aussie home letters much pleasure being mine in getting them.\n","321":"\n\nAt 4pm the battery moved forward to an advanced position about 1600 yards being S.O.S. Put the guns into action & then turned in for the night in a loft of a house. He shelled us all night from 4.2\" to 8 inch stuff, being on the corner of cross road in village we were in the centre of it. Each minute we thought he would put one through the roof, our position was one of uncertainty.\n","322":"\n\nThe Barrage opened out at 5.40 am. Fritz immediately put up on us, getting three crews in our Battery, all getting Bonzer \"Blighties\". As our gun was not working too good we took over A sub, but this too was not much good so we finished up on \"C\" Sub. He evidently expected us by the Barrage he put up. Moved forward at 11 am several hundred prisoners came in. They are of fine type. One Battalion belong to marines having anchor etc. on collars. Came up near St. Souplet, but Fritz had pushed the Yanks back to the railway line again. So we had to go back at the \"Toot\". Went into action behind a small village. Had a good rest, in the morning we put up another Barrage. The weather is keeping very fine. Received several Australian's letters at night.\n","323":"\n\nMoved forward at 2 pm to a forward positon through St. Souplet which is a fair sized village, much knocked about by our Barrages. The Hun had put up a fight here, having a steep Railway Bank & river on which to defend. Many dead are abut both Yank & Fritzs' came over country some two kilos past the above mentioned village to the new position 1000 yards from front line. He put a few 5.9 near us when coming up & five Fritz planes flying low poured machine gun bullets around us. They were driven away by \"anties\" & a few of our 'planes. Put the guns into action & then dug ourselves in for the night. Had to shoot a few rounds at 2 am but had a good sleep otherwise.\n","324":" Octover 1918.\n\nWeather is dull & cold with land mist on\n\nIt is rumoured that Fritz is evacuating here. Found two Fritz wounded in bush near by so they took them down to a dressing station. They were lucky to be alive so long. He put a few 5.9s onto the position we having to go to a flank. It makes you \"windy\" these few shots now & then. The weather is unsettled. Wrote a few letters.\n","325":"\n\nToday has been uneventful, rather wet & miserable. Just loafed around in tent. Had a few rounds gun fire in afternoon.\n","326":"\n\nMoved up to forward position at about 10 am the day being misty. Dug the gun in & stacked up the ammunition not finishing till dusk. Had to dig a humpy there being no shelter. We were too tired to sleep.\n\nHe kept us awake with shells pretty adjacent. In morning he put over a heavy Barrage but luckily it did not reach up to us. He stopped on the other side of road about two hundred yards up.\n","327":"\n\nHe put a good number of shells over onto our position, making us go to a flank on a couple of occasions. It makes the position uncomfortable when you know he is on it. Turned in & at 1.30 am we had to shoot a barrage, the Tommies hopping the \"Bags\" although on our sector the objectives were not too great. On our left it extended to some extent. All objectives were taken. He did not put any shells over at us since the stunt. Wrote several letters. The weather has cleared up again.\n","328":"\n\nThe lads have been souveniring up the line. There is not much to obtain. It is a fine day. Fixed our pit up a little.\n","329":"\n\nIt has been very quiet today & nothing of importance has happened. Wrote letters to get the Xmas mail.\n","330":"\n\nGave the gun a good clean up & fixed up the ammunition. Weather is dull. Received a few letters.\n","331":"\n\nThe guns pulled out of action tonight. We were not sorry. It is rumoured that we are going out for a long period of rest. We doubt it. Came through St. Souplet to waggon lines.\n","332":" to","333":"\n\nWent to Church on Sunday morning. The Padre was not bad. It was held in an old barn ventillated with several shell holes. The following days we have been clearing the waggons, preparatory to pulling out? cleaning horselines etc & of course having a cool off. Received a few letters from home all being welcomed. At night Fritz comes over with his bombs. It is a nuisance as all fires have to be \"doused\" & lights out. It makes the night so long having no alternative but to turn in. A plane came a 'fritzer\" last night. It was a fine sight, as all his flares came out in different colours. He managed the plane\n\nwell. It is very cold these days.\n","334":"\n\nDid the usual camp routine today & had a cool off. It is rumoured that we have to go into action again. Evidently some general looking out for a D.S.O. The lads are very unsettled about it & with a little more of this unfairness could cause trouble. Being attached to the Tommies our rations are very light; one has to buckle up a hole or two.\n","335":"\n\nThe guncrews went up this morning to the position to dig gun pits & to get everything ready for stunt. We went up on a G.S. waggon. Fritz made the road somewhat unpleasant with his 5.9 \"gifts\". Eventually arrived up there after a\n\ntwo hours travel having to go through Le Cateau& a few villages recently taken. The former place is a rather large town & railhead much knocked about in recent operations. Fritz made a good job of the main line by blowing some hundred yards up across a gully. On some of the trucks could be seen \"froggy\" furniture some Hun officer was about to send away to his home. A shell of ours decided the destination of same. Dug gun pits till dusk when guns & ammunition came up. I returned with the waggons to waggon lines to cool off for a while, having been up the longest last time. Fritz planes bombed at night but nothing came our way. It is very cold at night (in front of the village of Pommereuil our last stunt)\n","336":"\n\nThe waggon lines moved forward from Estcaufaux to the left front of Le Cateau, along a steep railway bank. Put up horse lines etc & dug a home in the bank, which proved hard digging having to pick practically all of it. We appreciated a hot tea & an immediate turn in to bed despite the bumps on the floor. Ammunition went up at night. The officers seem to arrange things so that men will be inconvenienced as much as possible. We have with us a very incompetent officer who we believe is responsible for such bad management.\n","337":"\n\nThe stunt came off this morning\n\n& was a success except in one place. Ammunition went up in afternoon. It is bitterly cold with rain. Our humpy is ventillated rather too much for this weather consequently we suffer from cold feet early in the morniings.\n","338":"\n\nGun limbers & waggons went up, as we are pulling out. The limbers came back the gun remaining in action. More bad management in Battery & horses & men on half rations. It is raining fairly heavy. Guns pulled out at 2 pm, the whole battery moving to better waggon lines in a large factory nearby. The horses are sheltered & we are in the factory having\n\na dry billet at last. Several fires were made in the hall (?) and soon we had our clothes drying & water on for a bath. Found ample coal in the engine room. The hot bath & change of clothes went well. Had a sing song when we turned in.\n","339":"\n\nDid a good deal of washing today having a big fire to dry them. The horses are in another part of the factory having a good floor & sheltered from wind & rain. Went down to Brigade H.Q. with a despatch. Le Cateau is a fine town, having some fine buildings in it. It has a theatre, at present a Tommy Concert Party is showing & a cinema. Fritz had had the interior altered a little putting his\n\ncolours around the walls. The weather is very unsettled. Received a lot of Aussie mail today. Did a rough guard of twenty four hours over a chap who got 21 days for drinking rum sent to pits. Wrote many letters until I got sick of writing the same news.\n","340":"\n\nDid little today kept the fire warm. The drivers are on their harness getting it polished up. A usual stunt when we are out of action. They (the heads)? think more of such things than of giving a man a clean change of clothes & a bath. It is still raining. Went to the Cinema show down town with several of the Boys of the Sub. Had a good time getting into the show, the crowd being great\n\n& we made a push. Beat any of the Sydney crowds for force anyway. The show was good. We sang all the way home for all seem happy now that the war is seemingly near the end. Made cocoa & toast on our arrival home then had another sing song. It is a change to be able to go to bed knowing that the roof is waterproof, also one can stand up to dress or undress without bumping wet canvass.\n","341":"\n\nCleaned the waggons this morning & oiled them over. Wrote letters at night. Had a sing song after the chaps came from the concert. I did not go having a sore foot & could not walk quickly.\n","342":"\n\nDid the usual work in the morning. In afternoon Sam Honey & self went down to see the \"Encores\" showing at the theatre down town. The show was excellent, all actors being professionals. The orchestra was all that could be wished for. At night we received Comforts from Citizens War Chest Fund of Sydney. They included shirts, socks, tobacco, sugar, cocoa & boiled lollies & games. Had a game of draughts & dominoes finishing up with a game of 500. The circles around the fires have debates about the end of war & the conditions. It passes the time away & much speculation goes on whether Fritz will accept our terms or not.\n","343":"\n\nIt is very cold this morning, a heavy frost being on the ground. All our blankets went away to be fumigated this morning. Did usual work in stables in afternoon had a few games of cards. Had a letter from Ern Gullen in Blighty, he is coming over again in a few days,. The \"Plonk\" men (D.A.C.) went back today, the old Battery men returning to the Battery after their two month spell. Wrote letters at night.\n","344":"\n\nHorses were let loose to graze so I was minding them, whilst doing this job I received the good news that the actual fighting had cease, Fritz having accepted terms of Armistice. Everyone needless\n\nto say was overjoyed on hearing such news. The Major gave the boys a barrel of wine to celebrate this historical occasion. Some were merry but it was a good date to be merry on. It is hard to realise that such news is true. Many flares were put up in and around Le Cateau.\n","345":"\n\nIt is not so cold this morning. Went to a Church Parade but the Padre had been evacuated the previous night so the Parade returned home & had till watering time off. Am makinga couple of serviette rings to take home as a souvenier of the Great La Guerre. Had an easy time today. Wrote letters at night. It is fairly cold & the circles around\n\nthe fires are fairly large. The larger the crowd the greater the yarns & stronger the laugh?\n","346":"\n\nPreparing for the G.O.C.s inspection which is to take place on Monday. Oiled the vehicles & cleaned the guns. It is very cold. Bob Forsyth came up about 10 am on bicycle his unitbeing billeted in La Cateau. Had a yarn to him. Looks exceedingly well after his Blighty Leave & rest down on the coast with the remainder of Corps. At night I went down to his billet which is a rather luxurious abode for a private. The place is furnishd out with Froggy material & is quite homely. Had a walk around the town. Many civilians are coming back to this town.\n","347":"\n\nCleaning up the waggon park etc. Did not work too hard. Arthur Pinkerton came back from base tonight. Was pleased to see him back. Had a strole down town to Corps Canteens. It is very chilly at nights now & bed is favourite place.\n","348":"\n\nHad a half holiday today so played a little game of football, enjoying same. It is good exercise. Sat around the fire at night yarning. Received a few Aussie letters.\n","349":"\n\nDid little work today. Cleaned up the waggons again. It is cold & dull. The ground is frozen over & very slppery being like glass.\n","350":"\n\nWorked hard today cleaning up generally for tomorow. Being tired at night went to bed early. The waggon park is a picture, every vehicle being oiled up & all brasswork polished. The harness too is well cleaned & polished.\n","351":"\n\nHad to clean the frost off the waggons & cold job too it proved. Major General McLagan C.O. of 4th Div. came around and inspected us at 11am being pleased with the outfit. So he should be. Went down to the canteen at night. Today saw the first snowfall. It was cold; that is the weather. Wrote letters at night. Received a parcel from Mrs. King of Dubbo, socks, etc.\n","352":"\n\nPacked the waggons etc. during the day. At night four of us went down o the theatre. It was an excellent show, the best I have seen in the military. All actors were professionals. The staging was all that could be desired & the orchestra first class, therebeing about thirty instruments.\n","353":"\n\nPulled out at 9am proceeding on our way to Germany. Passed through Basuel &Cathlon arriving at La Groise about noon. It is about 8 kilos from Le Cateau. Pulled into a paddock alongside an old brewery. We are billeted in the latter. Have good billets. It is very cold at night. Very frosty.\n\nThursday 21st November\n\nDid a little cleaning up. The horses were freezing most of the day. The days are beautiful whilst the sun is up. Had a read at night.\n","354":"\n\nPacked up ourgear & took it down to the waggons packing up the vehicles, thinking we were moving off. It was only an inspection. The men counted the Colonel out. All were annoyed. It is no joke packing up for nothing. Watched the first Division passby. The 1st & 2nds Brigades went by.\n","355":" Normber 1918\n\nDid usual work. Watched the Infantry go by. The 4th Division went by. Did not see Capt Brooks with the 46th Battalion. On Guard at night. It was cold too. The nights are clear with a good moon,\n","356":"\n\nReceived a letter from Os Ferns who is still in hospital. On guard till 5pm wrote a letter home today. The 4th &","357":" Brigades went by today. It is very cold.\n","358":"\n\nHad a game of Rugby Union this afternoon. All enjoyed the game, it will get a man into condition a few games this weather. Had a walk at night, being fairly stiff from running.\n","359":"\n\nPacked up ready to move out in the morning. It is raining and very cold.\n","360":"\n\nHad an early \"Reveille\" moving out at 9am. Passed through the small village of Favril then through\n\nPrisches somewhat larger than Pavril. Cartignes is rather more of a town than a village; it is full of Australians. We were supposed to billet here but there being no room, we came onto the next village by name Boulogne a small quiet place with its fine church & hovels all around. None of these villages have suffered much by shell fire, for it was about there that Fritz started a running fight & artillery was not used much. All roads were blown up by him & bridges. He did this work well.\n","361":"\n\nUp early as we moved out at 8.30am pasing through Cantraine, Semeries (Les Grandes Foress) and Semeries coming to thelarge village of Sains from here we went through Ramousies\n\nto the village of Liessies where we are billeting for some little time. The country passed through today is very rich, & one cant help noticing the small fields in comparison to down in south of France. The country looks very picturesque with small villages studed here & there amongst the green fields. The houses are well built in this area. Put up the horse lines. We are billeted in a house & are not so bad off in this respect. The weather is unettled & cold.\n","362":"\n\nMade new horse-lines & cleaned the waggons. It was cold work too. Received a little mail at night. This village is very dead. There are good many civilians in the town, they seem a poor lot.\n","363":"\n\nCleaned up the waggons and repacked them. In the afternoon we had a practice at football. Have debating society of an impromptu kind on the ground floor of our billet, all seated around the fire. It passes the time away & good arguments arise.\n","364":"\n\nHad a church parade at 10 am. it was not bad, but there was no music. In afternoon we had a scratch match (Rugby Union) with the 37th Brg. They won by 6 to nil.\n","365":"\n\nHad exercise in afternoon for football. Given a pair of horses & harness to look after, so any\n\npromoted to acting Driver. How pleased I am? Heedless to say I did little to harness. At night we had a good argument on Royalty versus President with reference to British Empire. It was heated too.\n","366":"\n\nHad the usual work to do, They have started the Education Scheme and it seems to be favourite with the lads these long idle nights. The weather is unsettled. Was on guard? tonight on Gun Park.\n","367":"\n\nPlayed the 38th Battery today. It was a fast game. We won by 6 to nil. Had exercise at night. The civilians in this village are dying off\n\nhaving no food. Rations not having been provided for the people released from Germany & returning. The Brigade volunteered to give the people half their rations. They appreciated it, no only the giving of it but also the reality of having a little white bread. The people now show themselves, as they were not wont to do when we arrived, evidently being frightened. We are now sworn friends They certainly are very thin & poor.\n","368":"\n\nWe let the horses go early in the morning into the field. They have a good time grazing & are putting on condition to some order. The Australian Rules players played the 38th but lost.\n\nHad exercise at night, went for five kilo walk & sprint, then went to the Education school. There are many subjects from which you can chose. The idea is to prepare all for civil occupation on demobilisation in Australia in near future. Some of lecturers are very good. Receiving many letters from Aussie up to Sept 30th.\n","369":"\n\nPlayed the 37th Btl today. It was a hard game & the large crowd were highly excited rom the onset, there being so much money on the match. The final score was 3 all. It was a hard game. Wrote a letter at night but am too tired to do much. It was a glorious day with the sun up. It is rumoured that the Jan-Feb 15\n\nmen met with a railway accident some being killed, several severely injured. Some from this battery are amongst the later. It is stiff luck having got through the war and then get an issue whilst on the way home.\n","370":"\n\nThe weather is very fine. The Australian Rules game was played today, the 37th Battery won after a hard game by very few. On guard at night. Did till 10.30 pm then went to bed.\n","371":"\n\nRugby Footballers played a scratch match against the 37th Battery they wom 21 to nil. A very funny match it was too, there being chaps playing who did not know the rules. Had a debate at night\n","372":"\n\nHad an impromptu Debate at night. Wrote a few letters. The weather is rather dull, received camera from Blighty, thus my greatest friend is again with me.\n","373":"\n\nPlayed the 110th Battery on their grounds, the day was wretched, raining with a strong wind blowing. They won by 5 to nil. Their forwards were to heavy for us. Half of our team was knocked out. I for one was \"out\" for five minutes owing to colliding with one of their side; my head proved the hardest for his was split open. All that I have is a headache & will have fr sometime to come.\n","374":"\n\nHad a football meeting, was to play a scratch match but the weather was too wet. Put the night in by having a Rough House. It was a rough house too. Put the football through the roof. Certainly doesn't say much for roof.\n","375":"\n\nHad a debate between 37th Bty & 39th, the former taking affirmative side of the question \"Should White Australia Policy be modified\". It was a good debate the 37th winning by 7½%. Packed up as we leave tomorrow.\n","376":"\n\nWe were leading Battery of 10th Brigade so left early. Pulled out at 9 am passing through\n\ngood country which appears to be very rich. The farm houses are all in the fields, a thing one does not often see in France, most farmers congregating in the village. Fritz had evidently left the people alone, as all villages were intact & civilians carrying on as usual. We passed through the village of Eppe-Sauvage, then Rance, which is a fairly large village up to date & has some fine buildings in it. Of course the Church stands out for largeness & beauty. We arrived at Froid-Chappelle where we stayed the night. Had a good billet. At night we had a chat to a civilian family where we were billeted. One soon picks up the \"lingo\" when you talk to them much.\n","377":"\n\nPulled out about 10am passing through the fairly large village of cerfontaine. The next villages in order of passing were Senzeille, Villers Deux Eglises and Villers Le Gambon where we were billeted for the night. Had a stroll around the village which is of ordinary size. The civilians soon grabbed a horse that was injured in one of the waggons, & had it skinned & dressed the same night. The cafe were crowded a fact quite obvious to all who understand the A.I.F. A passenger train goes through this village. We are billeted in a large factory and our beds are hard being made of concrete.\n","378":"\n\nWe did not leave till 11am today as the 11th Brigade led the way. Only passed through one village by name Rosee. Across the streets they had archways of trees & flags to celebrate the victorius entry of troops. Arrived at the small village of Flavion where we have to spend our Xmas. It is a dull uneventful place. The Brigade is camped here. Billets are scattered all over the place. We are camping in the school.\n","379":"\n\nDid usual work getting things cleaned upn. The horse lines are some distance from the parade. The old hores will have a rough spin during cold & wet season,no rugs having\n\narrived. Went to bed early there being nothing else to do.\n","380":"\n\nThe other three Batteries of Brigade have moved to surrounding villages so we have this village to ourselves. Looked around and obtained a bonzer room for two of us. Have a bar bed. Just like home. Hot water, plenty of coffee etc. The people are nice & we have great fun trying to compree each other. It is hard work, but we are improving each day. Practice makes perfect \nso they say\n. Pinkerton is staying at the place with me. Most of te chaps found private joints to live in.\n","381":"\n\nIt is a wretched day raining and a blowing icy cold wind.\n\n\n\nlittle happened worth relating today. Received some Aussie mail up to the","382":" October, not bad going.\n","383":"\n\nLeft this house that were were staying at to a better one; although I did not like leaving the people being so nice.

The other place is nearer the Cook House, a big consideration these bleak days.\n","384":" to","385":"\n\nHad a scratch match between \"A\" & \"B\" teams Rugby football, the former winning by umpteen points. All the lads have settled down in private homes, so we are dug in for the\n\nwinter. The people are very nice and homely. The weather has been wretched, that boing a good name for it. Rain and wind that takes the breath away. Hard a snow fall on the night of the","386":" The people have lived more at church than in their homes this week. They are great church goers. Have not received any mail of late.\n","387":"\n\nIn the morning we received a parcel each from the Comforts Fund Sydney, just a reminder that the folk out yonder still thought of us. They were greatly appreciated by the boys. At 10am about ten of us walked five kilos\n\nto see some Hun \"Bombers\". they are immense 'planes, have two machine guns, carry sixteen 25lb bombs, and several aerial torpedoes. Have two enormous engines, and carry about six persons. Took a few snaps of them. Xmas dinner came off at 5 pm. It was a success. Some of the chaps made fools f themselves, too much booze. The officers and Sergeants waited on the tables. After a few speeches appropriate to the events were delivered, the dinner party broke up. Several of E Subites had a sing songtill 9pm. The day passed off successfully.\n","388":"\n\nDid little today. It is very cold and windy. Had\n\npractice at football at night.\n","389":"\n\nIt is a cold wet wretched day. The wind is the limit. Played the 37th Battery Rugby this afternoon, in rain & gale. I defy anyone to name a match that has been played in weather to beat it. Our hands were numbed, legs dead & body wringing wet. We won by 11 to nil. Am now feeling very sick but in morning will be OK.\n","390":"\n\nDid usual work during the day which does not amount to much these times. The weather is wretched.\n","391":"\n\nHad a little exercise for football\n\nas we play the final match of Brigade competition tomorrow. All the folk of this village turn out in their best on Sunday. You would hardly recognise them for the same people of the remaining six days.\n","392":"\n\nPlayed the 110th Battery Rugby Football today and won by 6 to 3. We had the best of the game although they played very hard and lost their block in second half. We thus won the Brigade Competition. All of our side are sore. The 110 play dirty. The wather was ideal for the game. The match caused great interest.\n","393":"\n\nDid very little today being rather stiff and sore. My shins are\n\nwell scarred alsoback and neck. All the players are in the same way.\n","394":"\n\nHad a strole around the village. This is the Belgians Day out, when they all collect in family groups & have their feast. Consisting thisyear of Home made cake, very much like our pan cakes although they are baked. They fill up a gap nevertheless. At night the Battery had a dinner run by the men who invited the officer & NCOs. The spread was all that could be desired, and following the dinner we had an impromptu concert by the Brigade Concert Party. It was a most enjoyable evening, much more so that that of Xmas when Mr\n\n\n\n\"Booze\" spoilt it to an extent. The weather is freezing cold but dry.\n","395":"\n\nLeave to Charleroi is now obtainable so will join and see the place. Have not received any mail for some time. \"Pink\" & self went down to see some F Sub mates, so we had a game of six hand Euchre, putting in an enjoyable evening, finishing up with a good suppeer.\n","396":"\n\nReceived two small parcels tonight from Aussie. Had a yarnaround the fire at the QM store. The weather is still wet and dreary. A few of the chaps went to Charleroi today, and some to Dinant.\n","397":"\n\nDid little work today & there is no news to write about. One can only yarnor write these days as there is no night sport and there is a great dearth in reading material, this way. The life is very monotonous. Took a few snaps.\n","398":"\n\nThe village is dressed up today one would not know the civilians when they are \"togged\" up. they are great church goers.

Wrote a few letters.\n","402":"\n\nWth a mate (Corporal Tunks) I went to Dinant to have a look at this Historical town or what is left of it after the Fire Sticks of the Huns in","403":" had wrought what damagethey could. Werode on horseback, against a stiff wind\n\nwhich is not the best of company. The road in is very good, and the fifteen kilos were covered in a little over an hour. The town lies in a deep gorge or gully through which the river Meuse flows or at this time is fast approaching rapids. The river is very swollen and houses on bank are under water. the scenery is superb. Looking across the river you see the old fort some five hundred feet up, built on the soldrock jutting out, and predominating the whole country around it. This fort was originallt built in 1040 by Prince Ereque of Liege, was destroyed in 1466 by Charles 1, rebuilt in 1530 by Edward de la Mareq Liege and was captured in 1554 by Henry 11.\n\nfrom the river, steps numbering 408 were built up to the fort which was restored in 1675 by Louis XIV.

The British arrived in Dinant on the 23rd November 1918.\n\nOn the 25th April 1916, the Kaiser visited the fort of Dinant accompanied by twenty officers. As soon as we arrived there & found stables for the two horses we had a good meal, for fifteen kilo rides makes one hungry. When we asked for encore the waiter opened his eyes. Climbed to the top of the fort taking some good views as we went up. One can get some fine panoramic views from the top. All the ruins have been cleaned away so the destruction is not quite so noticeable. It is a place worth seeing. Marks on some of the walls can be seen where the people were lined up and shot. Arrived home at dusk, a little tired & stiff.\n\nWednesday 8th January 1919.\n\nIt is a most perfect Day, the best that we have had at this village. Our Sports too had been arranged for this day so success was guaranteed before the events started.\n\nHad the usual events, horse events attractingthemostspectators.Civilianscame out in large numbers to see the show. The 16th Battalion Band was a great asset to the afternoon's enjoyments. It is a very good band. Everyone enjoyed the turn out. Received a large Aussie mail at night up to 23rd November. By it the people in Australia went mad at the news of Armistice. Was sorry to hear of Joe Coopers death.\n\nhaving seen him under a month before his death.

Boasts of Theatres Cinemas etc. The streets are narrow, have a good service of Electric Trams. The main buildings are the Bank & Railway Station.\n\nIt would be a very dear place to live in, food is a High Price.\n\nAt night we went to a cinema then had supper and turned in a good Hotel. Charged 10 Francs for the room. Food onmenu being Steak & Chips 6 Francs. One could generally do an encore.\n\nDuring the day we stroled around \n\n\n\nthe town, looked at the Museum & another Cinema. The Meuse River runs through the centre of town. This place has not been damaged or destroyed by Fritz. Left a six and arrived Home near 10pm having to walk the Florennes Flavian track again. On the","409":" we had another Dance but the crowd was too great for the Hall as Grand Pa Ma Aunts etc turned up also. The CurÃ©is against dancing in the Hall, but the people ignore Him.

Had then to go on to Florennes a distance of five kilos on foot. No joke in early two feet of snow. Arrived at Charleroi about\n\n6PM having tea, then went to a Picture Show or rather a Vaudeville. Something like the Casino in Alexandria. It was a good show. Left at 9PM as the train was supposed to leave at 9.30PM but did not pull out till midnight. About forty chaps in our truck and the train did four miles an hour, stopping twice between each telegraph post. Chummed up with a second Div Infantry chap also going to Paris on Leave. We intended getting out at Mons but the train went through too quick. had no alternative but to go on to Lille as distance of forty miles.\n","420":"\n\nAll day we watched the miles go slowly by and indeed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na6635331.html\n\nthey did pass slowly. Often had stops of an hour to let passenger trains go by. At 7pm we came near Lille so Hopped off and walked the rest into the town. Fixed up at a Hotel we had a walk around the town which is rather large having a fine square, streets and buildings. One portion of it has been destroyed by the Boche. Had a good sleep after the train journey, about the worst that I have ever experienced. I'm going home in a much better train.\n","421":"\n\nTook a few snaps in morning. It is freezing cold 11 degrees Fahrenheit. Left by the passenger train for Paris at 11am.\n\npassing through the shell torned country of Lens, Bethune, Albert and Amiens. It now appears as a desolate waste & one can see at a glance the immensity of war. Arrived at Paris five hours late but we arrived that is the main thing. Went to a Restaurant and had a feed then turned in at an Hotel.\n","422":"\n\nHad a look around near the station then found our way via the tube to the Barracks to get our pass stamped back. The tubes are similar to those in London, althoough the directions & different lines are much easier to find in Paris, there being a few main lines. Most of the room\n\n\n\nin the compartments are for standing there being few seats in the car. Crowds of people block the Boulevards & streets which are certainly fine being very wide with wide footpaths. The buildings are all of a uniform height about four storey. This sets off the street to the eye. Avenues of trees (now leafless) adorned the streets Boulevards & places. We walked for a couple of hours along the Rue Madelaine, Italiens & Poissonaire. This is all one Boulevarde but in Paris the names of street is only for a number of \"blocks\". This confuses one new to the city. We passed some very fine buildings, as the Madeleine Church, the Society church of Paris where all \"the\" marriages take place\n\nnext we came to Opera the second finest of theatres in the world. It took several millions to build the Architecture is superb, We finally arrived at the Republique a fine Place. Had tea at the Army & Navy League Club, then found out the way to Alhambra. It was not much of a programme, too much fuffling, became monotonous. Amstopping at the Florida Hotel near the Madeleine Church.\n","423":"\n\nWith a party from the Y.M.C.A and guide we went to see the Palace of Versailles which is about twenty kilos from the city getting there by train. The palace and its wonderful park constitutes the grandest ex-Royal residence in the world, and its Historic association\n\ncovers over 225 years. We arrived there about 12 noon having dinner before going up to the Palace. Versailles is a large place and very busy at present owing to the Peace Conference now taking place. The motor cars outside the Palace numbers several hundred. Around the Palace wheel to wheel are thousands of captured enemy guns of all calibre. The Architecture is the very best that I have seen. It leaves London far in the distance. It was built by Louis XIII, enlarged by Louis XIV and inhabited by the French Kings up to the Revolution. It is now a museum. The different styles of Architecture of the XVIIth & XVIIIth cneturies are very pronounced on the latter extensions of Louis XIV. There is a magnificant Parade Ground and stables at\n\nthe back of the Palace. The Court yards are also great, having statues around it with an equestian statue of Louis XIV in bronze in the centre. Entering the Palace we were astounded with the luxury of everything, everything so grand and magnificent. There are huge dancing Rooms, magnificent paintings all rooms being highly decorativce the ceilings in particular. The main room is the Glass Gallery built in the time of Louis XIV. On the ceiling is painted in thirty scenes, the History of Louis XIV between 1662 & 1678. The Gallery is 244 feet long, 34 feet broad and 42 feet high. Each of the 17 windows overlooking the gardens has a corresonding arch decorated with mirrors with 24 groups of\n\nchildren in the cornice, models by the best scuptors of the time of Louis XIV. The most important Court fetes took place in this Glass Gallery. Some of these were - The fete in honouring the Queen of England 1855, Coronation of King of Prussia as Emperor of Germany 1871, & the solemn celebration of the centenary of the States-General by President Carnot & all the ministers of state 5 May 1889. You can get a wonderful view of the gardens from the windows, which extends for over two miles all of it being well planned out. Louis XIV bedroom is magnificent. He was known as the sun King, he had all his Rooms facing the sun. At either end of the Glass Gallery there is a room, one Hall\n\nof Peace, the other Hall of War. The Glass Gallery will most likely be the scene of the Peace Conference of this age. The Queen's staircase is most beautiful having pure marble steps and leads to the main wing of the building. The Gallery of Battles which is 150 feet longer than the Glass Gallery was built in 1836 by Louis Philippe. It contains a set commencing at the left of majestic compositions on the principal battles in French History, all are wonderful paintings. The Gallery is decorated with 16 bronze tablets on which are inscribed names of Princes, Admirals & Generals who died fighting; also 80 busts reproducing the features of some of these Heroes. Leaving the Palace we went down to the gardens which are immense and grand. You get a beautiful look at the Palace\n\nfrom these gardens, with its projecting centre piece and its two great wings. the length of the facade is 1350 feet. The Fountain Garden is wonderful. The ornamentation of this garden presents the finest collection of bronzes in the worldwhich were modelled by the greatest sculptors of the time of Louis XIV. Next to this garden is the Garden ofLatona. The Basin of Latona is wonderful. The marble group represents the Goddess with her two children, Apollo & Diana. She is imploring Jupiter to punish the Lycians, who insulted her when she asked them for a drink. Next we went to the lawn or Royal walk. It is 1079 feet long & 208 feet broad, although when we saw it, it was covered with frozen snow and the canal frozen over, with thousands\n\nof people skating on it. The basin of Apollo is wonderful. The group represents the carof Apollo, the sun-God, who as Greek mythology relates, rose from the ocean every morning to illuminate the earth & at evening plunged in its waves. It is now popularly styled \"the car stuck in the mud\". The Fountain of Neptuneis another wonderful sight. Leaving the Gardens behind we went to see the Trianons, Great & small. The former was built for Madame Maintenon, the latter for Marie-Antoinette. the Kings etc came and lived in the Houses to escape the formality of the Palace at times. The Trianons are much simpler, although built with fine marble, the interior being not so Highly decorative. Visited the Museam of carriages & Harness\n\nof the crown stables. The coronation car, built in 1825 for Charles X is wonderful weighing 15,432 ilbs. Returned to the city having tea & at night went to see The Folies Bergererather a good show. There is a Huge Promenade at back of the theatre Hall, where most people go at intervals. Music & all life is there.\n","424":"\n\nTaking a trip with the tour round Paris we first visited the original burying place of Louis XVIth & Marie Antoinette at La Chapelle Expiatoire in the city. After their execution at Place de la Concorde, their bodies were \"dumped\" in this place withtheir guard. They were removed years after. The place de LaConcorde is perhaps the most beautiful square in Europe and certainly one of the most Historical\n\nIn 1770 a terrible event occurred in the place. During a firework display given to celebrate the marriage of the Dauphon (Louis XVI) with Marie-Antoinette a panic & stampede took place some 1200 people were killed. The Guilllotine was erected on the square and both the King & Marie Antoinette lost their heads in this place some years later with thousands of their followers. In 1814 Prussian Troops encamped here, English the following year and Germans again in 1871 after the capitulation of Paris. History has also been made in these days during the war. The mourning of Strasburg & Lille. From here we went to Montmatre the northern part of the great city. This part once represented the brains, the wit and the genius of France. It was\n\nthe Home of the artists and of Bohemia. Most noted in this district are the night cafes, which were the life of Paris at one time. Some still have their original names as \"Chat Noir\" (Black Cat) \"Rat Mort\" (Dead Rat) and several others. The former one was started in 1882, & many gifted and witty artists & poets have since become celebrated as Maurice Donnaif the Academician of today. Leaving these interesting quarters we visited the Church of the Sacre Coeur (Sacred Heart) which is built on a large hill - considered sacred ground. the building of the Romanesque Church of the Sacred Heart with its Byzantine Dome was decided on by the National Assembly in 1874, and the expense has been enormous. The foundations\n\nwhich go to bottom of Hill cost 4 million francs. The distant view of the church is more interesting than the near one for the church is sombre and has nothing particularlyattractive about it. A famous dancing Hall by name of Moulin Rouge a very old place, very popular with the Parisians. Dancing took place of some kind followed by copious suppers. This place opened at 11pm & carried on till break of day. It was burnt down quite recently.\n\n"}}
