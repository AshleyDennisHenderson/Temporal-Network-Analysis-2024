the eve in happy surroundings & hearty company, in the morn Hal & I visited Cairo & had a day out for we went everywhere Rodel-al-farac, a motor drive of about 6 miles, the out to visit Bert’s friends where we had lunch after that did some shopping, buying many articles of apparel, after several garry rides around the city we got at last to the \"Obelisk\" for tea & after getting another four courses inside we hired another car & came out to the Kursaal, had a box enjoyed the show although perhaps lacking refinement had supper & visited my studio after our proofs heaps of success although only temporary. C.O. left for Alexandria after the new motors & pack sets, the lost baggage has come to hand at last. Large fire last night at Abassia.\n","2":"\n\nReveille 6.30. Hal left for Alex at 7.30 this morning & I expect him back late tonight, had charge of riding school & got as backsheesh a buster, we went over to the Palm grove & everything is looking beautiful in the afternoon I went down to Heliopolis & collecting trap etc, met young Stan & Gil who are in the 22nd Erics old crowd then I ran into Mac late of \"Maru\" he is still in the Gen Hospital. 6 aviators from the flying school gave an exhibition at the sports carnival yesterday & they were tip top although they would be of much more use up at Gallip when we were there. \n\nWrote to Mrs Keast, mother & Nell, expect motors tomorrow as C.O. has just arrived back from Alex the boys coming later, 3rd Regt who treked two days ago are getting on OK & no casualties to hand yet.\n","3":"\n\n63 wks of soldiering abroad.\n\nI took the old Triumph in to the garage this morning & when there got the prettiest little dog imaginable met the troop waggon on its way into Gherisha for the kit bags. Pard who was in charge was thrown off his horse in Cairo so I rode it from there on, got out to the show grounds at 5.15 & found the place closed up, it seems the lads only work a few hours, so we had to come home, & by the way we lost out little dog there also, we then called in at the Cairo railway station for the bicks but they were also closed up so then we came home in record time had tea got cleaned & with Harold went down the town paid a visit to the Kursaal which wasn’t too bad, & after having the usual feed we strolled home & turned in hoping that the morrow may bring forth something fresh.\n\nMotors arrive.\n","4":"\n\nReveille at 6.30\n\nFeed up & watered what horses we have got & then got the welcome news that our scraps were in Cairo & of course we weren’t long in getting them out. Cox & Dobbyns went in & found them all ready for the road, the got out just before lunch & they turn out to be the last 3 speed gear box Triumph war model a real daisy, everything of the best & all spares complete, she is a fair better model in every way than the last & is about the best combination obtainable, Chas & I went for a spin to Helouan after dinner & they went tip-top not a thing wants adjusting, did the 25 mile home in 33 minutes not too bad considering we had 2 ml of Cairo to negotiate after tea Hal & I went down the street & met Mac from our old house he still is at the palace hotel as electrician saw Stan & Gilbert again\n","5":"\n\n73 weeks of soldiering.\n\nRevielle at 6.30\n\nTrimmed the scraps up for the C.O. & I are going for a trip into town this morning left at nine & visited many places from Karr-el-nil to the Base hunting up stores & equipment, met Perce Clark, Vern Robley, Cashy all of whom are looking well, went down to Morings & had a yarn to Frank over to Goodridges & ordered our overalls got back home at 11.30 had lunch then I had to go in again, first to Steins where I met old friends, Eveliah Gardens where I fed, then ran out into the wheat country for a ride the machines are still purring lovely & seem to be fairly fast although too young yet to wind up, Went down the street after tea with Joc & didnt we have some joy, what with ragtime on other people’s pianos & dodging picquets we spent a lively night.\n","6":"\n\nRevielle same time as usual.\n\nStables then break – after that training for the men I meanwhile having one of my trips into the city, came out in time to go for a ride with the new lads everything went well until we got out of a walk when the horses did what they liked, had lunch then went for another tried to find Irving Turnbull but failed for he is now down the line. The flying people have been treating us to all sorts of exhibitions on the some are real beauts but you can pick out the learners for the machine is not near as steady one flew over a regt that was on parade & succeeded in emptying a few saddles. Rumors are afloat today to the effect that Helles is to be evacuated tomorrow don’t know how true it is. Mail is also expected in the morning so tomorrow might be one out of the box.\n","7":"\n\nEvacuation of Helles\n\nRevielle at 6.30\n\nAll the men went out for a mounted parade again this morning, the horses are exceptionally fit. The news came through the the complete evacuation of Gallipoli was effected with huge success, they got off as well as we only losing 4 old guns & 2 casualties the French got off as well, assisted by their Navy we were able to get all our mule transport away also, so that alone speaks volumes. Things up Salonica way are not too bright at the present but should take a different light when more of our troops make their appearance. Went down the street after tea & Gilberg came with, we ragged all the restaurants to some tune until kicked out by the Picquets, got home in time to see a brawl in the second regt which finished up in our mess-room. Bed at 11 pm.\n","8":"\n\nRevielle as usual.\n\nAs I have to go to the Barrage today along with the C.O. I cleaned & tuned the scrap for the spin, set out at 9.10 with a full tank & spare petrol in the back after doing several little jobs in Cairo we finally got on the road proper at 11.10, the run out to Rodel el-far was cut out in good time, but after that on account of the previous days rain the roads were greasy & sideslips were numerous but we managed to stick on, at Binha 17 miles out the C.O. hit a post which got in his road, off again after a few minutes halt we eventually got to Calint 2 miles further on where he hit a big fat nig, we arrived at Burra at 12.7 had dinner & set out for home at 3.30 after roaming the gardens & seeing the glorious grounds, the C.O. only upset the donkey carrying a huge load of bursirn got home at 5.10 after spending a most enjoyable day.\n","9":"\n\nJack Wills Chas & I went in for the Douglas this morning instead of going to Church found her to be OK although a trifle rusty, filled up & went out to Mena round the Pyramids where we had a wet set out for home at a steady 30 ml per hour & arrived without mishap.

At 9.30 the Brigadier inspected the Brigade & saw that everything was OK for the move this week which had been postponed to Friday. I went into the Savoy with a urgent to Gen Faire re remounts but could get no satisfaction, came out in a hurry & went to the review which was nothing like the ones of old. Mick M has got 6 months furlough to Australia & Steel 12 months in the afternoon I rode one of the remounts he gave me a rough passage what with aeroplanes & eagles, it was none to pleasant for either the horse or I. Stiny, Hal & I went down the town after tea called in at the Studio got our photos, had a feed as per usual & a bath which was highly appreciable.

Another British warship blown up in harbour more of Germanys spy turnouts, CO went out to see if we could get visible communication with the 3rd Regt but found it was impossible on account of the flatness of the country so dispatch riding will have to be resorted to. Camp is assuming quite a businesslike look water supplies & roads are both coming on apace. Mail arrived I got one from Nell & a large parcel from home containing many things of use to us.
