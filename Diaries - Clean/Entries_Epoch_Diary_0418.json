in Cairo at 9.30 went & had a few drinks after which I started off to have a look round. I met Frank Isaac & Frank McGrath. We had lunch at the St James Cafe. After dinner we had our photos taken and as Frank Isaac had to get home early we broke up the meeting at about 4.30 & were just about to separate when we met Les Payten & Fred Stephenson so we talked a while longer.\n\nAfter tea at the Petrograd I went to the Kursaal & met C. Selim Gandour Bey he very kindly took me round to his house for supper & introduced me to his wife. I left at about 10.30 & went to my room at the Minerva Hotel.\n","2":"\n\nWoke up at about 7.AM was quite surprised to find myself in a decent bed.\n\nI had breakfast at the \"New Bar\" after breakfast I strolled round putting in time till the train left at 11AM.\n\nThe journey to Ismailia was very pleasant as I struck some N.Z A..M.C. fellows off the Mahino which is now a hospital ship.\n\nWe arrived at Ismailia at 2.30 p.m & had some dinner before making tracks for camp.\n\nI will draw a veil over the 9 mile walk back to camp as I was wearing new boots & my remarks would not look fitting in writing\n\nArrived in camp at 6.30 & found 12 letters waiting for me, also the information that we are moving off at 10 A.M. tomorrow morning thus finishing our 6 weeks stay in the desert.\n","3":"\n\nAm tired before we start, am dreading our march into Ferry Post.\n\nWe left Pinchgut at 11.30 A.M.. The day was a regular scorcher & as my boots were new I had a pretty lively time. We eventually came into camp on the Canal at 4 p.m. amdead beat. Our life in Egypt this time has been so far one of fatiguing marches mixed with hard work on the trenches in the desert; most of the boys will be jolly glad to see the last of it.\n\nThe boys quickly get their spirits back we have been up to the canteen & bought some fruit etc & you would not recognise in them the string of deadbeats who were cursing their way across the desert two hours ago. They are all lying down singing & getting ready for another march tomorrow. We covered 7 miles today.\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUp, stiff & footsore, at 6 A.M. slingtents & packed up ready to move at 8 AM. Our breakfast consisted of slabs of cold bacon with bread jam & cheese not to mention a good tin of tea so we have fared very well. It is another scorching day & we have four miles to cover\n\nWe arrived at Moaskar camp at 1 P.M. & were lucky enough to find our tents pitched. Things are being managed much better lately when we have to move, our transports keep up with us & there is food all ready when we finish our march.\n\nOn Sunday about 12 men were courtmarshalled . They were dealt with very severely. Some men got sentences from 4 years to 12 months hard labour for refusing duty while another man 3 months for cheeking an officer. They march with a ring of guards with fixed bayonets all round them. It must be jolly humiliating\n\nHad a good yarn to Major Fitzgerald\n\n\n","5":"\n\nWe have been brigaded today & are now known as the 5th Machine Gun company.\n\nIt is almost certain that we will be off to France within a fortnight.\n\nWe have marched into the camp previously occupied by the the N.Z. lads who have taken our place in the desert.\n\nOur guns have been changed from today to Vickers light guns which weigh only 28 lbs.\n\nThere is an aerodrome about a quarter of a mile away & the planes are manouvering over our heads all day.\n\nA fresh water canal runs past the foot of our camping ground it comes from the nile& runs into the Suez at Ferry Post, about 4 miles away\n\nAccording to the papers there has been a heat wave during the last few days, so we struck it for our marches\n","6":"\n\nInoculated today & sore arms & dizzy heads are all the fashion, I being no exception to the rule.\n\nWe did no drill all day, as a matter of fact very few of us were fit for work.\n\nThe food here is good, we have no reason to complain. Plenty of fresh meat & also jam & cheese.\n\nWe have heard that one man out of the 20th Bat died from the effects of the march the other day.\n\nWe are having a lazy time of it all round here.\n","7":"\n\nHave been fumigated today, \"Down with the Lice\".\n\nReceived 2 letters from mother & one from Dot .\n\nHave had our first instruction on the Vickers gun today.\n\n\n","8":"\n\nVery windy in the morning. In the afternoon a rainstorm got us a halfholiday. We improved the shining hour by playing cards. I won £1.\n","9":"\n\nWe had the most curios Church parade that I have ever taken part in. On our right a couple of battalions were having rifle practice & the rattle of musketry at times almost drowned the ministers voice, while between ourselvs & the riflemen was a beautiful mirage which looked like a fine harbour filled with shipping. Only that we knew there was no water there we would never have believed it to be anything but real.\n\nIn the afternoon I won £30 at banker, quite a good haul.\n\nWere addressed by GenlBirdwood who said we would be leaving for France in a few days time\n","10":"\n\nDrill this morning, swimming parade in the afternoon\n\nSgt Tennant received his commission today.\n\nMet \"Sandy\" Steele, manager of our bank at Tirranaalso Dawson who used to be in the Wales at G'burn\n\n\n","11":"\n\nDrill all day, it is getting very hot & I only have a cap to wear.\n\nWent round& dug Sandy Steele up & had a knock roundwith him I lost £6 playing 2 up. ?\n","12":"\n\nWent into Ismailia at 12:30. Met Baseby off the Euryalis had a very pleasant afternoon. Arrived home at 7 p.m. & heard that we leave for France tomorrow.\n\nThe currency of Egypt is being changed from the Piastre to the Rupeewhich is worth 6 ½ Piastres or roughly 1\/4in English money\n","13":"\n\nOff to France & Fortune,\n\nMidst Sorrow, Pain & Death.\nOur heartsblood for our country\nA cheer with our dying breath.\n\nWe are quietly preparing for moving. The absence of all excitement is astonishing.\n\nOne would think to look at our that we were just about to tackle a short route march instead of the final stage of our long journey, from which few may emerge unscathed but we have seen our share of war & are ready for anything they care to handout.\n\nExperience has taught us that a heavy pack is the very ducewhen you are on the move, consequently we have dumped many a thing with a heavy heart for the sake of our backs.\n\nMoved from Moaska Camp at 8.45. p.m.\n","14":"\n\nEntrained at 12.30 A.M. after a short sleep under the stars near the station. Needless to say we were dumped into the eternal cattle truck, 25 men to each truck. We started at 1.45 A.M & arrived in Alexandria at 10 A.M. The scenery from Moasca to Alex. is very fine, it consists of mile upon mile of irrigated land, as flat as a billiard table & showing alternately green & black according to whether the crop has just been sown or is waiting to be reaped. This together with the island like mounds of palm shrouded villages & \nthe\n a sprinkling of patient natives completed a picture that it is worth travelling far to see.\n\nWe came on board S.S. Arcadian 11.45 A.M. worked like blazes all the afternoon to get the gear aboard and finally weighed anchor at 5.45 p.m. So goodbye to Egypt till we see her on our homeward voyage.\n","15":"\n\nWe have 2300 troops on board, our transport is the H.I.\n\nI was on guard last night. We ran into a storm, just my stiff luck. We had to sleep on the unsheltered deck & it came on to rain at about 2 A.M, to make matters worse the sea began to get up till 4 A.M we were shipping solid sheets of water over the bows. We were wet through in no time & continued to get a soaking every two or three minutes till we decided to dismount the gun at about 5.30. We gave it up as a bad job at 6 A.M & went below. My bedding I left floating about in the bows & have been letting my clothing dry on me all day & am hoping to escape a cold.\n\nThe rough weather has put ¾ of the men out of the runningbut I am keeping my record up & am quite well. They put the finishing touches on our discomfort by inoculating us this afternoon.\n","16":"\n\nFeeling very crook all day, I have had a cold & an arm about twice its usual size owing to the inoculation. Luckily the sea has quite gone down & we are sailing across an ocean of glass of the deepest blue. We had church parade in the morning & in the evening were left to our own devices.\n\nWe had stewed rabbit & Plum Duff for our dinner & pickles & cheese for tea\n\nLife on board is very comfortable & not nearly so monotonous as the previous voyages I have made, perhaps I am getting used to the sea.\n","17":"\n\nAm pretty right today. We tried all our guns to see if they were working O.K. They are a great improvement on the maxim & should prove their worth when we get to France.\n\nPassed good old Malta at about 4.30, it brought back many very pleasant memories that will not be easily forgotten.\n\nThe island had begun to seem like a home during my 3 months stay & as I recognised some of the places where I had spent many happy hours, I longed to be put ashore, just to have a good look at them once again.\n","18":"\n\nToday I complete my 1st year with the army & I flatter myself that in that time I have managed to learn enough of the soldiering to make some sort of a showing when we get where \"The whips are craking.\"\n\nThe sea is getting up roughagain & someof the men are down to it once more.\n\nWe have been passing isolated groups of islands all day, we think they must be off Sardinia somewhere.\n\nI am on guard again tonight. Macwas to have been instead but he got crook & I had to take his place.\n","19":"\n\nOn guard till 6 P.M.\n\nWe sighted the coast of France 4.45 P.M. & sailed along with it on our starboard side till dark.\n\nWe anchored outside the harbour of Marseilles for the night ready to enter in the morning.\n","20":"\n\nWe moved in to the wharf at about 6 A.M. The scenery here is very beautiful. Around Marseilles , the coastline is very bold & rugged. We saw trees, that have not been planted, growing about the hills for the first time since leaving Gallipoli.\n\nThe French people seem very apathetic here, the lack of enthusiasm is very noticable. I think that many of the people have all their men folk away fighting & that, I think, accounts for a great deal of the depression.\n\nMy French is very \"Patchy\" but I have succeeded in making myself understood somehow or other.\n\nLeft Marseilles at 2.30 p.m. through glorious mountain scenery & going right round the shores of the bay. I rode on the roof of the carriage for a couple of hours. we passed through a tunnel which took a quarter of an hour to get through\n\nThe scenery will do me, & the peopleare first class, they are kindhearted & gomad over us.\n","21":"\n\nPassing through the delightful scenery we came shortly after daylight to a fine river which we followed a couple of hours & came to Lyons at 7.30. It was greatly admired by us all with the two great rivers, spanned by numberless fine bridges, flowing right through the centre of the city. We stopped for about an hour & then continued our journey through fertile fields, past stately chateux & old world villages, some nestling under the shoulders of majestic mountains while the roofs & spires of others peeped demurely through the wealth of lofty poplars & budding small growth that seemed to hold them in their scented embrace.\n\nTalk about the women of France (Not half) anyhow, to cut a long story short, they have quite won our hearts, as we appear to have won theirs. They shower kisses on us from window & doorstep, & intermingle them with more substancial things such as chocolates & fruit. This land is rightly called La Belle France. I am beginning to love it.\n","22":"\n\nWe have been following the rivers Yvonne, Rhone & Seine all day.\n\nKeeping the Seine & Rhone on our right we passed through Sens & Melun & our hearts beat high with the expectation of passing through Paris but our hopes were dashed to the ground at Juvisy where we struck of on to the line to Calais in reaching there we passed through Verseille St Germain en lave , Nantes & Vernon. At Nantes we caught the only glimpse of Paris we were destined to get, the Eifel Tower soaring up into the evening sky ten miles away, shortly after that it grew too dark to see anything.\n\nThe scenery to day has again been magnificent. The chateuxs , bridges & aquaducts along the banks of the Seine together with the beautiful churches we have passed in the towns held our attention all the time. As we go further North, so the cold increases & we are beginning to feel it a good deal.\n","23":"\n\nToday has seen the end of our three days train journey & I am quite sorry to have to leave it.\n\nWe passed the English channel at 7.30 & saw a liner which had been torpedoed lying quite close in with only the funnel & masts visible. After that we came to Calais & continued North to a little station called Thiennes, it is 35 kilometers from Ypres & about the same from La Bassee.\n\nOn our arrival here we did a 2 ½ mile march with full kit up to our billets in the Village of Boeseghem.\n\nI had had nothing to eat except two biscuits at 6 A.M. we arrived at our billets at 2.30 P M & I was sent straight back, minus tucker, to the station as a guide. I got back about 4 p.m. & it was 7.15 before I got anything to eat.\n\nI had just got nicely into bed, I had to go on guard at 11 p m, when I was taken off that & sent downto the station with Mac to wait for a certain train, due at midnight & guide a man to our camp. This is the life, I don't think.\n","24":"\n\nIt is very cold, there is about 2 inches of mud underfoot & it has been raining off & on all day. We go down to the inn after parade hours & sit by the stove & yarn or play cards, keeping up the supply of liquid refreshments all the time. You could have a good night out for 1\/-. for beer only costs 1, wine 1½ & liquer 2. You can drink all night & not get drunk as all the drinks are very light.\n\nI am coming on very well with my French & have very little difficulty in making myself understood.\n\nOur parade hours are very long. Reveille at 6.15 A.M parade 6.45 to 7.15. breakfast 7 A M Parade 9 to 11.30 A M. Dinner 12. parade 1.30 to 4.30.\n\n\n","25":"\n\nStill very cold & sloppy we have been getting round like a lot of frozen rabbits.\n\nI paid a visit to Aire after parade this afternoon & had a very good time.\n\nLike all French towns it has its big church & collection of small houses. I should say it has 10,000 inhabitants all together.\n\nI cut it a bit fine getting back & when I started to return I couldn't find the right road. However I struck it eventually & had to walk 2½ miles in under half an hour to get home in time. I just did it by the skin of my teeth.\n","26":"\n\nIt is warmer today, the sun has at last made an appearance & we notice the difference.\n\nA Taube dropped a bomb on an ammunition factory about 4½ miles from our village this morning.\n\nMac & I went into Aire in the afternoon & made the acquaintance of two nice French girls by the name of Marthe & Madoline. We were invited inside & were given rum coffee & were made to feel generally at home. The only thing is that they can't speak English & my French is not equal to the strain of sustained conversation so we have to make numerous references to the dictionary & manage to rub along all right.\n\nIt came on to snow as we were going into Aire , quite a novelty for us.\n","27":"\n\nA hard frost this morning, everything frozen up & all that sort of rot, but a fine day later on.\n\nAfter parade in the afternoon we went into Aire to see Marthe & Madoline & had to scramble through all sorts of muck to beat the sentry but we got there eventually & had a real good time. Learning French depends for its pleasure or otherwise upon the teacher. I have never had such a pleasant lesson as the one this afternoon, I wonder why?\n\nWe arrived home just in time for roll call.\n","28":"\n\nFoggy cold early but warm later on.\n\nThe Company went to a gas demonstration but as I had a bad foot I stayed at home to mind the billets. There was no parade this afternoon so it meant a holiday all day.\n\nTime was passing very slowly when Capt Wright gave me a trip into Aire to get a rubber stamp made. It suited me down to the ground as I went & paida visit to Madeline & Marthe. I had a ripping time. In the Not half. I was learning French & drinking wine till about 7.45. Then I had to reluctantly take my leave & beat it to camp. I arrived home in good time for roll call.\n\nFrance agrees with me very well, I have never felt better in my life.\n\n\n","29":"\n\nThe weather has been improving every day. Today has been beautifully warm.\n\nIt is wonderful how peaceful everything is here, almost within range of the German guns. It is altogether different to the South where there is much interest shown in what is going on.\n\nThe scenery here is beautiful though quiet. Steeples & towers peep at you through the thin blue haze that forms round here in the mornings or poke their slender points gracefully from out a cluster of poplars. We are on the Hazebrouk road which runs right up to the firing line, consequently we have transport trains & motor dispatch riders passing every day, these & the dull mutterto the North & West are the only things that hint at a war being carried on so close at hand.\n\nI had a very lively evening & got home straight.\n","30":"\n\nNo Church parade.\n\nI moved heaven & earth to get extra leave to go & visit Marthe & managed to get it till 9.30.\n\nWe went in & had a first class time. I left at about 9.15 & arrived home at something after 10 p.m.\n\nWhen I got home. It had been pay day, most of the boys were \"well away\" things were all upside down & did not get quiet till about 11 p.m.\n\nI am enjoying my stay in immensely & I will be sorry in a way to go up to the trenches.\n\n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nNice warm day. After parade I went into Aire but did not go to see the girls as I did not want to make it too hot. I had a few glasses of beer, a game of billiards & a good square meal of eggs & chips & got home in nice time.\n","32":"\n\nWent to a liquid flame demonstration in the morning & arrived home at 1.30 - parade from 3 pm to 4.30. After parade I went into Aire to see Marthe. Had a jolly good time & arrived home at 8.40. I missed roll call but it was fixed up & I heard nothing more of it.\n\nI received 5 letters today there must be a lot more somewhere.\n","33":"\n\nOut on the range firing in the morning.\n\nIn the afternoon I went in to Aire to see the girls. My French is improving immensely, I am beginning to understand it rather well.\n\nThe shops are very funny in the villages here. There is no difference between them & the private houses. You have to just open the door & walk in. I used to feel uncomfortable about it at first as I often expected to find myself pushing into someones front parlour.\n\nThe towns themselves are very old-world with their canals & big squares not to mention the cobble stones which adorn most of their streets; Yet for all that I am very contented with France as I have found it so far.\n\n\n\n 7 Vendredi \n\nToday we start up towards the trenches to take our gruel. At last we are to face the great guns that we have heard muttering & grumbling in the distance for the past two weeks. Soon we will take a hand in the real struggle for victory.\n\nToday has been a hard one. A","34":" miles with full pack. Luckily it was a cool day & the march was a very interesting one. It lead us from Boesinghem through Steenbecque & Morbecque to the city of Hazebrouck which took 15 minutes to march through. After that we passed through the villages of , Strazeele, Merris & Outersteene. We pushed through outersteene & were billited between it & the town of Bailleul, which I visited as soon as we got our packs off.\n\nAt Morbeque we were reviewed at 10 AM. by Genl Joffre. He is a rather short fat man with a heavy white moustache.\n\n\n\n 6 Jeudi \n\nFooledabout in the morning. In the afternoon I paid what proved to be my last visit to Aire \n\nOf course I went in to see Marthe & Madoline, had the usual good time. I am very sorry that this is the end of what proved to be very pleasant visits. I don't suppose I shall be near Aire again, but one never knows in this game.\n","35":"\n\nPacks up & off again by 9.30. with sore shoulders & feet.\n\nInstead of passing through Bailleul we retraced our steps to Outtersteene , for a distance of about 12 kilos from there we followed the Southern road to Estaires as far as the village of Les-long-Champs , where we struck off East along the Armentiers road which we followed through Steenwark to Erquinghem where we bivouacked. We are now but three kilos from Armentiers .\n\nOur march today, though very trying, coming as it did on top of the one of yesterday, was interesting enough in parts. We watched aeroplanes being shelled, saw our own boys getting Australian field artillery ready for action for the first time in history in Europe. We also had some big shells lob pretty near us.\n\nTodays march was about 14 miles\n","36":"\n\nSlept sound & long, got up at about 8 A.M.\n\nStayed round the billet in the morning & was sent up to H.Q. with a dispatch. In the afternoon we were suddenly told to get 12 men ready to go up to the trenches at 6.30.P.M. I was told off as one, but poor old Mac had to stop behind.\n\nOur nerves were a bit on edge as we did not know what sort of a reception we would get going in. As it turned out we missed the shrapnel & except for a few stray bullets we had nothing to trouble us.\n\nOur journey led us through Erquinghem along the Armentiers road to the ruined village of Bois Greniers , here we found every house shattered by shell fire & the church with only a ruined bit of tower standing we took our gear off the waggons here & put them on a truck, this we pushed down a mile long tramline, after this we carried them ¼ mile to our position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nOur post is known as Emma Post it is a fort behind the first line. This part of the firing line is known as Bois Greniers .\n\nJust here it is an afternoon tea party to Gallipoli, except for a dozen bullets from a machine Gun we haven't had a thing near us. We are only about 400 yds from the Germans & we walk about as we like over the parapets & all.\n\nOf course the shell fire is very much worse but they have sent none near us today & it is just as well as we are absolutely open to shrapnel & one good shell would nearly get the lot of us.\n\nThe country here is quite flat with our guns & theirs on high ground at the back of the positions.\n\nRuined villages & tall square clumps of leafless trees are a feature of note round here. The trenches in our post are very solid but afford no protection against shrapnel as they are shallow & wide while the communication trenches are murder.\n","38":"\n\nRainy & mucky today. Early in the morning I went out over the parapet to have a shot at a couple of hares which were playing about in front of our post. I got a couple of shots but got nothing except mud over my ankles but that didn't matter as we are all wearing big rubber thigh boots which are a great godsend as they are warm and dry.\n\nWe have to go for our water along about 300 yds of road which is swept by a machine gun & on our way pass all that is left of a small cottage in which is a great life sized Crucifix. The cottage has been leveled with the ground by countless shells& only the part of the wall where the crucifix hangs is left & there is not a scratch on it though on one side the wall has been carried away within an inch of the cross. \n","39":"\n\nA cold clear night but it started to rain again about 5.30 AM & has been going on & off all day. It is a regular Blondentrick to walk along our trenches the mud is as slippery as beeswax & life would not be worth living here only for our big trench boots.\n\n\"Fritz\" leaves us alone here except for swinging a machine gun round our parapets on spec at night, you hear the bullets hissing all round your head & its not pleasant.\n\nAn unfortunate accident happened yesterday, one of our officers was accidentally shot in the neck by one of the other officers. He died shortly afterwards. His name was Lieut Brewster, I won't mention the name of the chap who shot him.\n\nWe have a good comfortable home here we have good sleeping quarters & a fireplace for cooking & our sergeant happens to be a good cook.\n","40":"\n\nIt has been fine today & given us a chance to clean up.\n\nIn the daytime it is safe to go about anywhere you like but at night you have to sit pretty tight as they rattle their machine guns round in the most unlikely places when you least expect them.\n\nThe trenches here are swarming with the biggest & cheekiest rats I have ever seen, they swarm amongst the sandbags when you are on guard & over your body while you sleep. I can tell you it would give the most level headed girl hysterics in about two ups.\n\nThere are only six of us & a Sgt with one gun here & we have no firing to do.\n\nI am keeping O.K. so far even though it is wet. You can't compare this to the Peninsula but of course it would get worse if there was anything doing.\n","41":"\n\nNothing much doing. This is the most deceptive place imaginable. Everything seem so peaceful & you go a bit away from the cover & before you know where you are you find yourself right in the middle of machine gun bullets orshrapnel. I have not had any very close calls as yet, but there is tons of time yet.\n\nIt rained again today though not much\n","42":"\n\nA fine day today. I have a trip into Aire to buy rations. It is the first time I have been away from the trenches since we arrived here so as I am making the most of my chance & having a good feed.\n\nI took a great load of tucker back to the boys it took me all my time to get back with it.\n\nGoing & coming I had to travel about 500 yds of open road commanded by their machine guns. Luckily for me they let me get past without firing though they had been putting them downjust before I started.\n","43":"\n\nAnother fine day also another trip into Ersinghein .\n\nIt was a very lively trip for me. Going out there were a lot of our aeroplanes up & the shrapnel fired at them dropped all along the road I had to travel. I managed to make it all right & had a good time. incidentally I got my pay.\n\nComing back the shells were a jolly sight worse. I was right out in the open when they started looking for a battery with high explosvies. I had to get shelter & I had the choice of two farms. I chose one & had hardly taken shelter when a shell lobbed right on the centre of the other farm & only left the walls standing. I reckon I was some lucky. They fired about 150 shells all together & I had to go past before they had stopped as it was getting dark.\n","44":"\n\nA wet day again we sat about the dugout playing cards & reading - the constant state of dampness in which we are living us beginning to tell on me & I am anything but well.\n\nI have discovered that my boots are letting in more water than they keep out. That means constantly wet feet. Our dugout is afflicted with that unpleasant malady known as \"soakage\" which effectively ensures your blankets being damp at any odd time when you want to turn into them. As for your overcoat etc, the weather itself looks after that, so it is in every way you look at it \"My little wet home in the trench. I forgot to say that there is a foot of water right through the trenches so that raised \"Duckwalks have to be made to let us get along.\n","45":"\n\nWet again today. Our duckwalks are so slippery with mud & water that it almost impossible to walk on them.\n\nI went tosee the doctor this morning but couldn't find him. I got nice & wet instead & missed my dinner. I had another try in the afternoon with no better success only that I took jolly good care not to miss my tea.\n\nWhen I went on guard it was raining steadily & I was wet through when I came off. Tonight the Germans seem to be extra nervous, they sent up over 500 flares in the hour on a front of about 2 miles. They send up large numbers every night while our chaps never show any. They must expect us to rush them & I think we shall before very long.\n","46":"\n\nStill wet. I am dead crook again must see the Doc tomorrow. I am afraid it is mumps, they have been very prevalent among our boys I am afraid I have them.\n\nWe were relieved at 4.30 after our tenth day in. We were marched back to billets 1½ kilos from Flembai a couple of miles from the trenches.\n\nBefore we left the Germans gave us a lively sendoff in the shape of about 50 very high explosive shells which fortunately did very little damage though some of them came closer to me than was pleasant.\n\nWe got \ntriple\n rations today owing to a mistake. The only thing that anoyed us was that it didn't happen a couple of days ago as we had to leave a lot for the chaps who relieved us- no time to eat it all.\n","47":"\n\nWent to the Doc this morning he thinks I have mumps. I was sent to the 7th Field Amb. & from there to Fort Rompo just outside Armentiers & isolated. The chaps here are very decent.\n\nI managed to get my sox dry for the first time for over a week.\n\nThe AMC chaps here are on a good wicket as they are quartered in a brewery & get all their beer for nothing. They just walk in & turn the tap on. I wish I had their luck.\n\nI have to put the night in here waiting to be sent on. All infectious cases are sent right away so I should get a trip.\n\nThe chaps who relieved the No 2 gun of our section had 3 men buried this morning by shell fire. We weren't half lucky, missed it by about hours.\n","48":"\n\nGood Friday.\n\nStill at Fort Rompo waiting to be sent on. Things are very slow here with sick cases as the wounded take the preference.\n\nI got away at 3.30 p.m to go to the Casualty clearing station. It is at Baillule & to get there we passed through Erquinghem, Armentiers & Nieppe eventually arriving at Baillule at about 5 p.m.\n\nThe towns here are remarkably close to one another within a radius of Baillule of 10 miles there must be at least a dozen big towns including Armentiers , Nieppe, Erquinghem, Steenwark , Outterstien Ypres, Kemmel & a lot of others that I don't know. in Australia you wouldn't find such a collection in a circle of 50 miles.\n","49":"\n\nStayed at the clearing station all day & found it very dull. In the evening I got full of it & finished out up the town.\n\nI strolled round & bought a few things that the boys wanted & came home again. I felt better after my stroll as it is very dull hanging about a casualty clearing Station.\n","50":"\n\nThank the lord I am being sent on today to one of our hospitals.\n\nWe left Baillule at about 12.30 & had a run into Belgium to pick up some more patients we went from Hazebrouk over the border past a couple of small towns to Poperinghe from there we returned to Hazebrouk . We left Hazebrouk again at about 4 p.m. & went through St Omar & Calais to a place called Etaples where we had to stay for the night. We go on to Havre tomorrow.\n\nWe were starvedon the train as the boilers burst in the kitchen & we had next to nothing to eat.\n\nOur conversation with the French people is very funny. We speak in French & they in English, both being proud of our accomplishments. Though they speak better English than we do French- as yet.\n","51":"\n\nWe were sent from Etaples to hospital today.\n\nLeft Etaples at 4.30 p.m en route for Havre . We do not arrive at our destination till tomorrow. We arrived at Abbeville at 5.30 p.m & as we didn't leave till 7.45 I decided to have a look round. I found it a fine city with a river running through it but I only had time to get something to eat & have a bit of a look round before I went back to the train. I had to jump on as she was going I only caught it by the skin of my teeth\n","52":"\n\nPassed through Rouen in the early hours of the morning & arrived at Havre at 9 A M & went into No 9 Stationary hospital.\n\nI am pretty crook owing to being so long without treatment & will not be surprised if I am a good while getting right.\n\nThere was a big fire in Havre this Evening. We could see the glare here it seemed to light up the whole sky.\n","53":"\n\nHad my hair cut.\n\nLife here is not too bad, the only things that hurt are the fact that we have no canteen & no pay but I expect I shall get used to it.\n","54":"\n\nHospital\n","55":"\n\nHospital\n\n\n","56":"\n\nHospital\n","57":"\n\nHospital\n\nHospital\n","58":"\n\nHospital\n","59":"\n\nHospital\n","60":"\n\nHospital\n","61":"\n\nHospital\n","62":"\n\nHospital\n\nOur Salient bombarded. Three of our chaps Stafford, Whalan & Flatman were blown out at White City.\n","63":"\n\nHospital\n","64":"\n\nHospital\n","65":"\n\nHospital\n","66":"\n\nHospital\n","67":"\n\nHospital\n","68":"\n\nHospital\n","69":"\n\nHospital\n","70":"\n\nHospital\n\nTook part in a concert given by \"The Whiz Bang Dodgers recited three lines & took part in a sketch.\n\nThe concert was a great success.\n","71":"\n\nGoing into convalescent camp today.\n\nThey make you work here -- no good.\n\nWent down to what is known as No 2 camp in the morning onfatigue & down to the beach shovellingshingle into lorries in the afternoon. It is a good mile & a half to the beach but it is a pretty walk & the beach itself is very pleasant only they keep you at it. They want to have you fit when yougo back to the trenches.\n\nDown to the beach in the morning only had to load two lorries. In the afternoon I was on the R E fatigue did hardly any work.\n\nDown to No 2 camp in the morning & on fatigue at our own camp in the afternoon.\n\nNo 2 camp again this morning. It is lovely & warm so I am enjoying it as there is not much work doing.\n\nDown in the stone quarry in the afternoon.\n\nLeft the hospital at 8.p.m & left Havre from the Gare Maritime at 2 A.M.\n\nThe Spring is now visible everywhere. All the country is one mass of green. It is a soft green as the trees shed their leaves every year & they are altogether different from our dark foliage\n\nOur first stop was Rouen. we arrive there at about 11AM. Stayed there till 5.15 P.M & started for Etaples.\n\nArrived at Etaples at 4.30AM pretty tired from my two nights in the train.\n\nWe went to No 2 Divisional Base camp to await a draft going up to the firing line\n","72":"\n\nHad a quiet day today as I am a bit on the tired side\n","73":"\n\nHave been put in a draft to go up to the front today.\n\nHave been refitted with equipment & rifle.\n\nAs it was my last night in Etaples I decided to try & get out to have a look at the town. I had no money but nevertheless had a pretty fair time\n","74":"\n\nEntrained at 3 AA.M for Sheenwerk.\n\nWe passed through Boulogne Calais Strazeel Hagebronk Baillnot & arrived at Sheenwerk at about 12.30 P.M. We had dinner & then started to march to Erquingham & through to headquarters along the Bois grenter Road. I arrived there at 5.45 P.M. & rejoined the boys at 7p.m.\n\nSince I have been away 3of our chaps have killed by Shelffire Stafford, Whalan. The last two men were in my old section when I was in the battalion.\n","75":"\n\nNo rest for the wicked. I was hoping to have a couple of days rest but will have to go up to the trenches at 1P.M today.\n\nWe were paid before departing.\n\nWe go to what is known as No 23 or isolation post.\n\nArriving at the post we found it all right. Nice & quiet & all that but I and another chap have to go for rations every evening at about 9.p.m along about 1000 yds of road with stray rifle & machine gun bullets floating around pretty thick they give you a nasty taste in your mouth right enough.\n\nWe were paid 40 francs this morning before coming up to the trenches.\n","76":" Jendi\n\nRather quiet all day. A few odd shells at aeroplanes. our quarters here are most comfortable the only thing wrong with it is that it is a bit wet.\n\nThings were quieter than usual going up for rations but the drivers came up drunk & with all the labels off the bags. We had to sort them out on the dark road with machine guns cackling all round & expecting to get a burst round ourheads\n","77":"\n\nVery heavy bombardment by both side though they only sent a couple over our way.\n\nWe do some very fancy cooking here. Fried eggs, pancakes made with raisins & eggs. porridge rice custard (fact) & fried steak.\n\nWe did our rations in tonight went down for them & missed the honkers. Some other chaps got ours. Fortunately we have some eggs & porridge left so we shant starve.\n\nThe weather is OK. & I am taking the opportunity of getting some letters written while I have the chance\n","78":"\n\nThe artillery have given our little happy home a fairly lively time of it. About 6 shells in all came unpleasantly close. One of them made the dugout fairly rock.\n\nThe artillery has been very lively all day today though except for that particular little lot we have missed them.\n\nLife is a pleasure here now. We are in a quiet position with plenty of food & little work. The weather, too, is lovely so all is well with the world.\n","79":"\n\nVery quiet mostly. They sent one over in the morning that knocked one chap out close to us.\n\nI wrote letters all the afternoon & had a quiet time generally.\n\nThere is no doubt about it this job we are on now is a soft snap. unfortunately it wont last long as we expect to going up to the front trenches very soon.\n","80":"\n\nA good deal of aeroplane work in the early morning with some heavy burst of firing.\n\nDuring the day the big guns have been going off & on but keeping well awayfrom our part of the line.\n\nToday our aeroplanes played a smart trick on Fritz. One went over very low in no time the German parapet was lined, with every man pumping rifle & machine gun bullets.\n\nWhen they were nicely excited & beginning to forget to keep close to the trench - smack - smackwent our batteries right into their fire trench with shrapnel. It shut them up like one o'clock.\n\n","81":" \n\nWe were relieved today & go back to the billets.\n\nShells everywhere we go. We can't get away from them anyhow. As we were coming along the Bois Greniers road a shell hit a cottage phump just after we had passed it & followed it up with two more, which failed to explode. A bit further along they slung shrapnel high & behind us.\n\nArrived at the billet safely was very glad to see Mac again.\n\nWe had barely got settled there when they started tossing 5.9m high explosives everywhere around the billets, fortunately not on them. The next one to us got one shrapnel which turned their cookhouse up & wounded three men. We were all expecting one here but though they kept it up well into the night it never came & we went to sleep to the \"Music?\" of the guns.\n\nMai \n","82":" \n\nWent to sleep listening to Fritzes guns & was wakened up by our own 4.7's bidding them good morning.\n\nThe Morning was comparatively quiet \nbut \nand I went into Erquinghem on leave in the afternoon.\n\nWhile I was away the every thing round the billet- though the nearest one was a good 150 yds away. We passed along the road about half an hour after they had finished & found nothing but shell holes frightened Frenchwomen & fallen trees. Personally I wasn't at all sorry that they had finished off before I got to that bit of the road. It was only a respite however, as they opened up again very shortly & once more we went to sleep to the sound of German shells. That is 3 hour-bombardments in one day. We had one in the morning, & all the shells unpleasantly close to us.\n","83":"\n\nAnother day of intermittent shelling. The Germans seem to have ignored the front line & are evidently bent on making things lively round the batteries. In the morning they sent a few over & in the afternoon started a systematic & heavy shelling of the batteries behind our billet. It is a weird sensation to hear the big fellows screaming over the house to phump into the next field. I am always expcecting them to drop one short for luck.\n\nToday one of our aeroplanes was shot down & our observation balloon broke loose & was very heavily shelled over 1000 shells must have been poured into it. but the last we saw of it in the dusk it was sailing serenely onward in a cloud of shrapnel smoke. The observer came down in a parashute soon after it broke loose\n\n\n","84":"\n\nA very quiet day as far as shelling was concerned though they lobbed a few over in the afternoon.\n\nI went to have a hot ba\ni\nth in Erquinghem (so long since I've had one that I couldn't even spell it right)\n\nAfter the bath we went & celebrated, this being our last night before going into the trenches & you never know but that when you come out again it will be feet first.\n\nWe all got gloriously merry & had a concert in the barn till one of the officers came & told us in no uncertain voice to \"cut it out\" & go to bed. So we went.\n","85":"\n\nWe go into the trenches today for 12 days. We left the farm at 1.30 P.M amidst the sorrowful farewells of the French people who didn't want us to go & arrived at the trenches at about 4 P.M. we are No 4 position which covers the Salient. Things are pretty quiet just here but round about us the whizz bangs and boinks have been floating about some.\n\nI have taken \nof\n on the job of cooking. We found everything upside down but I managed to get things straight & give them pancakes for tea.\n\nWe fired the gun over the parapet & made the sparks fly off Fritz's barbed wire. I have also done a bit of sniping. You have to snipe over the top, no loopholes here & the trenches are only 300 yds apart. At night there are two men on at a time & at least one must have his head up all the time.\n","86":"\n\nDid 2 hours guard from 1 till 3 A.M & then we had to stand to till about 4 A.M. So we had no tucker I had to start right away on the mile walk to white city & back for rations. We had porridge for breakfast ration & bacon for dinner & steak & chips for tea.\n\nDuring the afternoon they shelled both sides & around us very heavily with big shell & sent some 77 mjm high Explosive round our parapets for luck.\n\nI had jusy got to bed when I was called up to go on fatigue to White city & carry a big Machine Gun loophole back, this lasted from 9 pm till 11.20. No sooner had I got back than a very heavy artillery fire opened on our right accompanied by showers of flares & machine gun fire. The night was pitch dark with not a sound from the trenches opposite us. It was very weird standing to not knowing what to expect however they cooled down at about 2 A.M & I got an hours sleep till stand to at 3.30.\n","87":"\n\nWe had breakfast this morning with shrapnel knocking the dust off our parapets. The only one that missed the parapet was the one that came straight at us. We were lucky.\n\nI gave the boys fried steak & mashed potatoes with gravy. Some class menu for the trenches.\n\nThe Germans have been very quiet all day. We had an all night stand to. The 7th Brigade intended to make a raid on our left but it didn't come off (The all night stand to did though) It was pretty dark & we felt a bit nervy at first Mac had just got into bed when I pulled him out. It was dead cruel but it had to be did.\n\nI slipped into the dugout at 12 o'clock & slept till about 5AM but most of the others got no sleep at all.\n\n\n\nRaid\n 7th Bgde\n","88":"\n\nA wet miserable day. Very quiet all day.\n\nIn the evening we had our regular stand to from 8 till 9 at 9.20 we got the order to stand to all night at 11.30 our artillery of all callibres started a very heavy bombardment of the German lines. The din was terrific, it set all our nerves trembling, soon the German artillery replied the air seemed full of bursting shells flying shrapnel & ear splitting reports. Our little spot received particular attention 5 direct hits within feet of us & as for shrapnel it was continuous. It lasted for about an hour & a half. During the bombardment they kept up a trickle of rifle fire at our parapet but they seemed very badly shaken & fired very wide. There bombardment did little harm as we were all under cover & expecting it while they had their parapet lined not knowing what to expect. Immediately the bombardment ceased the 7th Brigade raided the German trenches inflicting heavy losses with insignificant loss to themselves, they also brought 4 prisoners. They got the glory & we got the shells but we all have to work together.\n","89":"\n\nGot to bed at about 6 AM after cooking breakfast & got a sleep till about 11.30 Then I had to cook dinner after which I took a trip into \nErqu\n the billets to buy some extra tucker & hear the latest news about the sea fight. I arrived back at about 7 p.m.\n\nIt is a big strain in the front trenches with the heavy watches, sometimes a stand to all night, and little sleep together with a good deal of work. I should say that I have averaged little over five hours in every 24 and that has been had in snatches & consequently is very broken.\n\nWe have now been in 5 days & have another 5 to do but we have broken the back of it now & it will not be long before we get a spell.\n\nI don't know where Fritz's heavy guns have been for the last couple of days. I think we must have put a good few out of action.\n","90":"\n\nA very wet day, it inteferred with cooking operations a good deal but I managed to get the meals about on schedule.\n\nThe night was as dark as pitch and about the worst I have had on guard. Their bombers were out & owing to the darkness we were unable to see them. The bombs came all round our post & a very weird feeling it was. They came out of the darkness without a sound & you feel so helpless. The only remedy was to stick your head over the parapet & keep it there. I did so & their snipers observed me by the light of their flares & made it pretty hot. At last one of them got one so close that it spurted dirt into my face. I wasn't at all sorry to be relieved at 1 A.M. it was still raining then.\n","91":"\n\nOur artillery is proving daily its superiority over the Germans. At about midday we gave their trenches opposite the salient a terrible pasting to which they replied with only a few guns.\n\nIn the afternoon 5 of our aeroplanes started to go over the German lines to direct our artillery fire but they got a very hot time of it. First of all they were met with a veritable storm of shrapnel which they faced without a turn. On the heels of the shrapnel came a \"Fokkar\", one of the Germans fastest battle planes. As our chaps were only recconoitering planes they were no match for the Hun who carried a machine gun. Besides this he was half as fast again as ours, he singled one chap out. it was like a falcon after a pigeon. He got above it & dived down on it pouring out a stream of machine gun bullets, we all thought he was gone. I don't know how he escaped but he kept going & eventually reached our own lines. The Fokkar then made off.\n","92":"\n\nA wet day again. Plenty of whiz bangs. Three or four just came over our heads while another blew a large sized hole in the parapet it was lucky it was not near us.\n\nWe are all very cheery about the North Sea fight & the Russian victories in Gallicia \n\nOur artillery has been giving it to the huns in large lumps & thick & thins have sulked.\n","93":"\n\nFairly fine today thank the Lord.\n\nOur dugout is suffering from shell shock & is likely to fall in on the slightest provocation. They started tossing 5.9 shrapnel accross at about 4.30 P.M. I was sleeping the sleep of the just & the old dugout was rocking a treat so Mac came along with a rush & yanked me out.\n\nI forsook the dugout & dossed in the gun pit after tea but I couldn't get any rest even there as our chaps & the Huns started bombing up at the salient & we got a screen of their shrapnel in front of our trenches as a result. They kept it up for half an hour & then our artillery gave them socks.\n\nWhen we knocked off they evidently had a bad attack of nerves as they started firing at all sorts of imaginary things in front of their trench much to the discomfor of one of our parties which was out in front.\n\n\n\nRaid\n 1st Divn.\n","94":"\n\nA very wet unpleasant day. I received 4 letters, the first for a fortnight.\n\nWe can hear a sustained roar of rifles to the North, probably up towards Ypres. It sounds just like sea waves beating on a shore punctuatedby dull heavy explosions which we know to be shells\n\nAnother rotton night tonight. The first division are making a raid and as usual we have to bear the brunt of the artillery to draw the enemy's attention away from them.\n\nThe fireworks started at about 10 to 12 midnight & lasted for half an hour.\n\n3 of us had to sit it out in the trench & we were nearly deafened & blinded by the shells that came closest. As usual our particular little spot had particular attention, They always pick us out. Fortunately none of us were hurt. We got back to bed at about 1 p.m.\n","95":"\n\nWet & miserable again but thank goodness we get relieved today so we are looking forward to a good quiet time at the billet.\n\nWhile we were coming in the Germans started putting some shrapnel about but we were lucky enough to miss it though it was a bit unpleasant hearing them whiz over our heads & bursting a few hundred yards ahead\n\nWe arrived at the billets shortly before 5 pm. I had to have a wash and a shave before I was game to go in & face Ma & Marie Louise & Anne Marie at the farm.\n\nWe were all as happy as sandboys & had a rare old sing song, forgetting all about such sordid things as the trenches & the war though all the time through the lulls in the wind the boom of the guns & the roar of the rifles up North was borne fitfully to our ears, but we have learned by now to let the future go hang & be happy while you can.\n","96":"\n\nAll clocks were put on one hour right throughout France today.\n\nI went into Erquinghem for a hot bath & a clean change but came home early.\n\nWe had a grand concert in the barn at the billet followed by a supper. All the girls at the farm were there also three of the Officers It was a kind of reunion as this was the first time that the four gunsof No 1 section have been out together it was a great success & we turned in quite happy at 10 p.m.\n","97":"\n\nWe are all pretty tired today.\n\nWe put in the day as best we could & in the night we had to go up to the trenches as a working party from 8 p.m till 1 AM. We built a mounting for the gun in the reserve trenches & had a glass of rum when we came home.\n","98":"\n\nStill tired, put in the morning fooling round, in the evening we had an impromptu dance in the big cess pit in front of the billet & turned in quite happy.\n\nHowever we were not destined to sleep as we had to get up & stand to for ages at about 12.30, however it didn't come our way but one man was gassed in a village a couple of miles away. There was a heavy artillery bombardment all the time & we had visions of a trip up to the trenches but luckily it wasn't necessary & we got back to bed \nacross\n safely about half an hour later.\n","99":"\n\nOn aeroplane guard, watching for hostile planes. During the morning I saw a grand fight between three of our battle planes & two fokkars. It was jolly exciting the machines were beautifully handled. They would sweep out of the fight & soar above the rest & then swoop down almost vertically with their machine gun going like mad. Eventually the fokkars got the worst of it, one was disabled & the other made off. None of our planes were damaged though there were some marvellous escapes on both sides.\n","100":"\n\nNo rest for the weary. Up to the trenches again today.\n\nWe have to go to Emma post We left the billet at about 2 p m & arrived there shortly after 3 pm It is a rotton post as there is not a parapet in the whole place that will stop a shell.\n\nAs per usual there is to be a bombardment tonight. All the time we were out there has only been one & we strike one the first night in.\n\nThe bombardment came all right but Emma post did not get hit. It was just as well as the best cover I could find was a dugout with only 3 rows of sandbags on top.\n\nThe fun started at about midnight & lasted half an hour. They sent some nice shrapnel back at us but did very little damage, though the whole ground was rocking like a earthquake\n","101":"\n\nI am cook today, we only had two meals, one at 1 p m & the other at about 7.30.p m, we did not get up till about 12 o'clock.\n\nIt was my turn to go for rations, nearly a mile each way. Coming back I ran into the outskirts of a German bombardment of our communication trenches & had to take shelter for a while. When I got back to Emma I was just in time to sit throug another. I have seen enough shells to last for some time, two bombardments in two nights is not bad going.\n\nI got to bed at 1.30 AM & do not intend to get up too early in the morning either.\n","102":"\n\nPlenty of strafe today. We didn't get up till about midday for breakfast.\n\nIt was a nasty night. Bursts of strafe off & on right through the night. I went to sleep at 2AM & refused to move until they started lobbing them on top of me. I have faint recollections of feeling the dugout rock & hearing dull explosions in intervals of semi wakefulness but I pulled the blanket round my ears & kept on sleeping. A bombardment at night is a fearsome thing. The whole sky seems aflame with a baleful light. It fair gives you the jip even when you know its not going to come your way. They take a lot of getting used to.\n\nThis afternoon a shell hit our billet killing four & wounding 8. Mac is O.K. & nobody from No 1 sec was hit. They were mostly new chaps, just joined up having a lesson on the guns.\n","103":"\n\nPlenty of strafe again today.\n\nSome fine aeroplane work by our chaps, four of our chaps flew right along the German lines in a cloud of shrapnel smoke & returned safely. We couldn't take our eyes off them as we expected one of them to get hit any minniteAt that time there were eleven planes up at the one time & it was a great sight.\n\nThe shelling gets worse here every day on both sides. It will be a pretty lively place by the time the division that is to relieve us comes in.\n","104":"\n\nPay day today.\n\nWe had some shells of big calibre near us this morning and later on a couple of smaller ones sent pieces into the post. One hit just alongside my head & dropped at my feet.\n\nAt midnight our batteries bombarded & theirs replied. Again our post was picked out. We all had to crowd down behind our flimsy parapets & sit it out. We had a very rough quarter of an hour. They burst all round us but except for blowing two chaps over with the force of their explosion they did no damage.\n\nIts getting very hot here. We have had about 8 or 9 bombardments in about 20 days.\n\n\n","105":"\n\nAny amount of strafe today. Some big ones in the morning.\n\nIn the afternoon while I was cooking the tea a thunderstorm & a shower of whiz bangs came on us together. I did the ostrich act. There was only a small bench handy so I stuck my head under that & left the rest of me sticking out in the trench, \n&\n things were all right until the rain found its way in in a big stream & caught me in the middle of the back. That settled it so I beat it to the nearest dugout.\n\nAbout midnight came the usual bombardment. I was up for rations & got back to the post in nice time to be in it. Luckily they sent them well to the left & we got very little of it.\n\nThree shellings in the one day is pretty good going. I shall be glad when we get a move away from here.\n","106":"\n\nToday concludes our first year away from home.\n\nThere was nothing doing during the day but we got a few over in the evening. At 11.30 our nightly strafe began, we got several near us. One cut through some trees about 15 yds away while many others sent pieces whizzing around us, a couple of chaps were hit with them but luckily they were about spent & didn't hurt.\n\nWe got to bed about midnight I had barely got to sleep when I was pulled out to go on guard (1.AM) at twenty two two the music started again, it lasted till 5 minutes to two. We also had two gas alarms. Pretty good business for one night.\n\nRaid\n 5th Bgde.\n\nSunday 25 June\n\nWe left Sydney a year ago today.\n\nAs per usual all there is to talk about is shelling. A very severe one at midday, another about 2 p m & then some more about 4 p.m. We are getting quite used to them. I suppose they will switch right on to this post again soon it is nearly our turn.\n\nAt midnight our guns opened up again. Guns, Guns, Guns. We are sick of the sound of them. Fritz, on this occasion laid down the law in no uncertain voice. It took him an hour, the air was full of the shrapnel in which he couched his protest to us disturbing his slumbers. The ground fairly trembled. The object of our bombardment was to prepare the way for a raid by the 5th brigade which was a great success. We had only 5 casualties while they lost 2 machine guns, 5 prisoners & a good few killed.\n\n\n\nRaid\n","107":" Batt.\n","108":"\n\nSlightly wet today.\n\nIt was very quiet all day, as we know quietness, but at about 10 p.m his guns opened up suddenly on the next post to us. it is the worst bombardment we have had so far, & thats saying a good deal though I think he is gradually strengthening his artillery here because we make it so willing.\n\nPeace for half an hour then off we go again, just a surprise burst this time, we just got into our dugouts again when we had to get out to another one.\n\nAt 1AM our artillery started up for a raid to be made by the 18th Batt. They gave us hell back especially after they tumbled to the fact that we had caught him on the hop again & got over his parapet. I am just sick with the concussion of shells & must try & get to sleep. It is now 2A.M & I have to go on guard at 3AM so I will get a brief sleep while I may,- goodness knows when I might get another if they go on at this rate.\n","109":"\n\nI left off trying to go to sleep but lo & behold before I had been in bed ten minutes our guns burst out into one deafening roar. It was our artillerys farewell to Fritz as they move out tomorrow.\n\nWe could not hear ourselves speak for the thunder of our guns The Germans evidently alarmed started to bombard our second line with heavy shrapnel. I am sick of comparing bombardments, but this one was awful. Our dugout heaved & shook, we were expecting every moment to be our last though we didn't seem to show it. We talked & smoked as if everything was right. We have stood so many that we take them as a matter of course now. After over half an hour things gradually quietened down. That made 5 bombardments in 2½ hours & yet when it was all over I slept like a top. The rest of the day was quiet.\n","110":"\n\nA lot of things happened today. We are to get relieved tonight. That is about the best of them.\n\nA very hard bombardment broke out along the front of the brigade on our right. The Germans made a raid on our trenches in the middle of it but were annihilated by the 6th Brigade who raided in their turn & took 21 prisoners.\n\nOur relief didn't turn up till nearly 2A.M. & when they did they had neither rations nor ammunition. I was told off to stay & give them the hang of things. I had to turn out right away & take them up to Bois Grenier for their ammunition etc. by the time we got back it was after 4AM. & still raining, it had been going off & on all night. I had to wait till about 7AM before I could see their officer. After that I beat it to the billets\n\nWhile the other chaps were going home they were bombarded by shells with weepinggas in them& some of the boys have swollen eyes today.\n","111":"\n\nArrived home at about 8 A.M. had some breakfast & then had to go right on to fatigue work till dinner time. In the afternoon I had a much needed rest.\n\nWe had plenty of beer to drink after tea & went to sleep at peace with the world.\n\n\n","112":"\n\nPlenty of work.\n\nThe 4th M.G. Coy take over our billets this evening & we are getting the place ship shape for them.\n\nI am very sorry to leave this billet as the people have been most kind to us. There are two very nice girls there too, Ailen & Marthe. They are very good to us & we think a lot of them as they will not let anyone take any liberties with them & it would be pretty lively for anyone who tried to while any of our boys were about.\n\nWe left our billet at about 10 p.m & marched to our new one in the outskirts of Erquinghem where we settled down at about 11 o'clock.\n\n\n","113":"\n\nPlenty of work fixing things up. We don't like the idea of the regular routine again.\n\nWe went down to Erquinghem & had a much needed bath.\n\nThe billet here is not half as nice, as the one we have left, we have to live in little huts which are jolly hot & sleep on boards which are pretty hard.\n\nWe got a few letters today.\n","114":"\n\nNo early morning parade but I am on fatigue. I had to take a couple of chaps down to the clink at 6.30 AM. Cleaning out dugouts in the morning. In the afternoon I had to go down to Brigade H'qrs after some maps.\n\nThe war news is still very good from all the fronts. We are hoping to be back before too long now.\n\nSaw one of our planes shot down by a Fokkar , he managed to get his machine under control as he nearedthe ground.\n","115":"\n\nStill at Erquinghem\n\nA few more letters today.\n\nGermans tried to stop one of our raids but failed.

All marching to fresh fields of glory ordeath in the waving fields of the Somme\n\nWe left Erquinghem at 11 AM & arrived at Strazeele at 7.30P.M. & what a march it was. It reminded me of the first few lines of Barbara , \"Up from the meadows rich with corn\". We passed through mile after mile of wheat, Oats & beans withhere & there tall square patches of darker green thatmarked a hop field. Through Steenwerck & Croise du Beck then a big circle roundwithBaillule always on our left to Metern which we left on the same side till we came to the hill on which Strazeele sits like a verdant crown. From there we could get an uninterrupted view of nearly 20 miles to the East & South, we could see the spires of Hazebrouk , the belching chimneys of Aire while away to the east lay a low line of hills.

When within 2 kilos of the town we swung round it in a grand circle as we had done Baillule , and passing through Avers , came back on to the main road at one of the suburbs on the other side called Montieres. Just before that we passed a brigade of French infantry marching in an opposite direction to us. We kept straight on through & Brielly till we reached the Somme at Allie-sur-Somme , we marched through there & came to rest at Picquigny where we were billeted. We are very doneup as we did close on 12 miles today on top of a pretty near sleepless night in the train. We are told that we are now about 40 miles behind the fighting on the Somme.

The only birthday present I got was orders to move up to the trenches.\n\nWe left Warloy-Baillon at 7.15 P.M., we marched through Senlis & Bouzincourt. It was here that we first came level with our heavy guns (15 inch) giving Fritz a rough passage. We carried on & marched on towards the gaunt ruined tower of Albert whose shattered skeleton was pitifully illuminated by the sheets of flame from the 12 inch howitzers near its base.\n\nWe marched on & eventually slept out in the open in our overcoats, by jove it was cold.\n\nThe cannonade was terrificall night, this is a nice place we are being pushed into, I don't think\n","135":"\n\nThis morning we were given \nin\n accomodation in an old support trench to the old French line that at one time ran near Albert.\n\nThe Cathedral at Albert is as remarkable as the little cottage at white City (see date of April 11th) The spire has been brought down, right on top was a huge gilt statue of the Madonna, it must be quite 20 ft long. The shell has torn the spire below the figure away, it fell as far as the top of the tower & was there caught by the broken steel girders of what had been a dome & held suspended at the same angle as the hand of a clock pointing to the hour of 4, far above the street below, though it must weigh several tons. It is a very queer sensation passing under it when the sun is making it look for all the world like a tongue of flame.\n","136":"\n\nMoved off at 11p.m. & marched up towards the fighting. We passed through La Boiselle & the wood of the same name & finished up in \"Sausage Gully\" amongst our heavy guns. It was a pretty nerve racking march though the noise was worse than the actual danger\n\nTuesday 25 July\n\nSpent the day in the same place, We had just got nicely to sleep when we were called out to get ready to go to the front line. We moved off shortly after 10pm through batteries in action wheel to wheel, 6in 4.7in & 60 pds the artillery which is making the Hun crouch in his dugout & stay there. Through Contalmaison across the narrow open valley beyond, filled with thousands of shell holes & lit by the fitful ever present glare of the guns in the rear, then half an hours sit in the open while the 20th Batt opened out for a charge, which was unsuccessful owing to them not knowing the ground, past a dressing station where one poor chap was gurgling his life away through a jagged hole in his throat, then through a communication sap where we stayed till daylight about 600 ydsbehind the front line.\n\nWednesday 26 July\n\nOn again at daybreak to the front of Posiers that had been taken the day before by the 5th Batt bombers, their dead bodies were lying thick along the parapets.\n\nWe had marched about 5 miles & had had no sleep & it was beginning to tell on us. No sooner had we arrived than we subjected to a fierce shell fire. The trenches were no good to stand against it being so battered about but we had to stay there.\n\nAt dinner time our chaps & some Tommy chaps started bombing out the trench ahead of us & Fritz tried to bomb up ours, our lads soon frustrated his attempt but the bombing out ahead turned out to be a most desperate piece of work. 17 men were reccomended to have their names sent in for V.Cs but 14 of them were killed so it shows how severe it must have been. They were standing fully exposed in no mans land being sniped, bombed & shrapnelled but they got the trench though not till that night\n","137":"\n\nLittle sleep & many shells. Mac's birthday. Their fire was very eratic today. As a result of the Magnificent bombing of our lads, we took & held about 100 yds of trench, though we paid dearly for it, yet I am sure Fritz must have done the same.\n\nWe have now a hold on about 200 yds of the Huns first line beyond Posieres & about 100 in his third. We run right out in the middle of his trenches like two capital Ts on top of each other- thus , the wavy lines being Fritzes & the black ones ours. The Village of Posiers lies 400 yds on our left rear & is held by the 19th Batt. who finished up with about 80 men left out of 13.00. from shell fire alone so you may guess what an inferno it was.\n\nOur bit of trench has only a sandbag barricade between us & the Germans & they try & bomb us out, it is lively at times but they will never shift us.\n\nToday we got 4 men in from No mans land who had been out there since the night of the 24th, they had been living on dead mens water under a constant rain of shrapnel,- no bon?\n","138":"\n\nWe get relieved today at 10 A.M. Mac & I had a trip back towards the reserve but we got lost in the ruined saps. We had to take a jar of rum back to the other half of our section but after being lost for an hour or so & being almost caught by shrapnel, we just dived into a dugout in time, we decided the best course was to get back to our guns while our luck was good, & we did.\n\nJust before we were relieved the Germans tried to retake the bit of trench we had taken by bombing They took our men by surprise & things looked very wobbly for a while, I expected to have Fritz coming round the trench into my back any minuitbut with the help of our Stokes mortar battery & a 17th Batt Lewis gun we got it back\n\nComing back I was missed by inches with a couple of shrapnels, for the second time in the morning. They seemed to have me set. But I got back to the limbers O.K. at midday.\n\nAt night the","139":" charged as a division but were cut up- nuff said. They got into our own artillery fire in some places & in others found the barbed wire not cut.\n","140":"\n\nWe are back with the limbers right amongst hundreds of guns, the main forceof the British artillery in this sector. They are constantly in action & the very ground seems to wriggle under the terrible concussion, yet we can sleep under it as peacefully as if we were at home.\n\nDuring the evening & night we were pulled out of our beds twice for gas alarm but nothing came along so we went back to bed. After that Fritz must have shelled us as he wounded a horse tied to one of the limbers & it had to be destroyed the next day. I was so sound asleep that I knew nothing about it till the morning so you may guess the dangers that beset you here even in your sleep, but we take the risk with a good heart & an open chanceso what more could one wish for?\n","141":"\n\nStill in the same place, it is pretty hot for shells, Fritz goes looking for the guns with whiz bangs & gives us a lively time, we only have shallow holes dug in the ground with no overhead cover which are really no protection at all.\n\nThis evening the aircraft on our side were very busy, no less than 43 Allied planes firing up at one time\n\nThe evening bombardment was not as heavy as usual though we have had some nasty shrapnels close handyTwo of them burst right over our limbers just as we were getting our rum issue so we got an extra nip on the strength of it.\n","142":"\n\nSo far our company has had only 11 casualties only one being killed. We move up into supports. Just before we left Fritz put over about 8 bursts of 5.9' coal box shrapnel. He didn't do much good except to frighten some horses, though the men had some marvellous escapes. We moved off at 1.30 P.M & arrived at reserves at 2.pm\n\nIt is safer here than where we came from even though it is closer to the front line. I have been asked to be cook & am taking the job on for the two days we are here.\n\nWe were watching our big guns giving Fritz merry this evening, big & thick, it certainly was some bombardment. They completely blotted out a patch of ground about a mile long & 500 yds deep, you could not see the place for smoke & debris I wouldn't be a German for quids\n\n\n","143":"\n\nStill plenty of shells. This certainly is some push. The wounded are constantly passing, it is the worst side of the life here seeing them going along but you never hear a sound from them.\n\nMac & I are bunking under a German ammunition limber. During the night last night they put shrapnel over us & got 8 hits on it, one came right through & only for hitting the rim of the wheel would have got me in the head.\n\nThe Germans dig fine dugouts. One near me is 12 ft deep with glass doors, stove, telephone, four poster beds with spring mattresses & electric lights. In fact every luxury that you could wish for. Anyhow our boys have them now & thank Mr Hun very much for being so kind as to dig them for us.\n","144":"\n\nI am still cooking & we are still getting plenty of shells. We are just about used to them & only make a scatter when they get right on top of us.\n\nThey caught a pioneer battalion on the hop today while they were digging a communication trench & knocked40 of them.\n\nI fooled about all day ducking shrapnel etc. Mac & I are quite happy.\n","145":"\n\nMoved up to the firing line at 1.30 P.M.- 2nd dose?\n\nShortly after we got there we had a Sgt. killed & 1 man wounded by one of our own big shells falling short. You get hit here both from the front & rear.\n\nWe were lucky in getting up to the trenches without a casualty as the shells were going all round us. You can't get away from them wherever you are about here.\n\nWe had a very rough time in the night. Fritz whipped them in all round us & we were due to \"go up\" any minuit. Yet in spite of it all I fell asleep about daylight. I was quite surprised to find that I was all right after the way they were blowing things about when I went to sleep.\n","146":"\n\nSent back in the morning to H.Q. with a note. Nearly got caught by Shrap on several occasions near Contalmaison. We charge tonight. Our is the only gun out of 16, going over the parapet. We began moving up to our positions at 7p.m. Our artillery preparation had been quite effective. At 9.18 the attack commenced. We had to go over at 9.18½. When the order came I jumped onto our parapet fair into a H.E. shell which blew me back into the trench & giving me several wounds in the left hand also the left arm. I was just about unconscious & light headed from shock. I went down & was trampled on, I had barely got up when another shell almost buried me. I lay under the parapet for a while & at last decided to get back but found the sap blocked so I lay there till about 1 AM. By that time we had the captured trenches consolidated & were bringing in prisoners & during a lull in the bombardment I jumped out of the trench & started back to our starting point of 7p.m. across no mans land. It was a rough trip with shellholes, broken trench shrapnel & darkness but I got there at last & found that Mac had been sent up to help consolidate the position. We took 2 lines of trenches on a 3,000 yds front. Our orders were to get it or not come back till we did.\n","147":"\n\nAt about 1:30 A.M. I left to go to the rear Through over a mile of sap & open to our reserves. Fritz was shelling the lot furiously I ran most of the way execting to be blown out any minuit, owing to my over-wrought nerves. He nearly got me once or twice, which did not tendto calm me down any, especially as he had a perfect enfilade on the sap which I was going through.\n\nI eventually arrived at our reserve guns near Contalmaison & had my hand dressed at a dressing station. I also got a drink of coffee which tasted heavenly. From there I walked back to the ambulances in Sausage gully, near our limbers, after that I went to a dressing station in La Boiselle wood & was taken to another place where I was inoculated.\n\nI got into a motor there & was taken to . There we were put into a train & sent to No 11 Genl. Hosp. at Camiers, near Etaples, where I arrived about 7.30 PM & had a bath. I was travelling for 20 hours after being hit & felt just about done & was not sorry to get into a soft bed & clean sheets.\n","148":"\n\nThe Doctor saw my hand & ordered hot fomentations\n","149":"\n\nGot marked for England & Expect to go either today or tomorrow. Only the more severe cases get sent on.\n\nTwo of the fingers of my left hand are badly knocked about. The bone being splintered in one, right up near the top. There is also \nof\n a piece of H.E in my arm & I am suffering from shell shock.\n\nThe only danger is that my hand will become septic as the wounds are full of dirt.\n","150":"\n\nHad my first shave for 10 days (I needed it)\n","151":"\n\nWas wakened up at 4 A.M. & sent by motor to Etaples from there by train through Boulogne to Calais, a trip that had I been feeling not so down on it I should have enjoyed.\n\nWe arrived at Calais at 11 A.M. We had to wait till 7 p.m. for the tide, then we crossed the channel to Dover in the \"Dieppe\". The passage took an hour & a half. At Dover we took the train to Colchester, passing through the outskirts of London on the way. We arrived at Colchester at about 2 A.M.\n","152":"\n\nWe are put in the General Hospital at Colchester where I met Sister Bloomfield Dixon who is some relation to either the Faithfulls or Chisholms, also Sister Cunningham who comes from Q'beyanso I was in clover & very well looked after.\n","153":"\n\nHad a look around Colchester. It is a place of about 45,000 people & very interesting.\n\nThere is a fine park there with an old castle in it which was taken with the town by the roundheads under Fairfax in 16 hundred & something. In the castle is a museum with specimens of the Roman period which was found round the district, it is very well worth seeing.\n\n\n","154":"\n\nPut the afternoon in in the park.\n","155":"\n\nColchester\n","156":"\n\nColchester\n","157":"\n\nHospital\n\nColchester\n","158":"\n\nColchester\n","159":"\n\nLeaving Colchester tomorrow.\n","160":"\n\nLeft Colchester at 9.45 A.M. en route for Harefield Park.
