get up for early morning parade. 9.30 a.m. Loaded more ammunition. We all had to pass in one blanket and our kit bags until after the stunt. During afternoon packed up ready to move off. 8-30 p.m. left Daours for Hamlet. As we were going through Aubigny Fritz started shelling, wounded three Gunners and three Horses. We then set off at a full gallop along the road. The off wheel horse fell through getting into a shell hole on the road. I only saved myself from falling off by grabbing a strap, but lost my tin Hat. One gunner fell off the limber and the wheel went over his ankle, result, sent to Blighty. Arrived in Hamlet 11-30 and after fixing up the horses, slept under a tree.\n","2":"\n\nUp at 7 a.m. feeling very tired. Fritz shelled thick and heavy just behind where we are camped. After dinner made a dugout, but found later that we had to move again. Packed up all the wagons. Getting ready for the stunt on the morrow. During afternoon Fritz shelled the position behind us. Went to sleep curled up in a bag and my overcoat.\n","3":"\n\nAwakened at 4 a.m. by the battery behind us opening fire. The stunt opened at 4-20, just daybreak. 7 a.m. had to go with water cart for water, as we were coming back the first batch of Fritz prisoners (about 30) passed us, they all looked very pleased with themselves. When I got back I found that the wagons had gone on, so had to wait on the G.S. Wagon & Cookscart. Saw several batches of prisoners going along the road during the morning and afternoon (Thousands of them) also saw some Machine guns and Field guns. Moved up to our new position 1 p.m. Coming along the track passed a lot of wounded Fritz’s and dead horses. One weird sight was seeing an Aussie and a Fritz lying dead with their bayonets through each other. Taking part in the stunt were Tommies on the left, then the Aussies and N. Zealanders, then Canadians with the French\n\non the right, a distance of about 20 miles. All the objectives were taken. Went to sleep under an Ammo wagon never woke all night although the guns and planes were going all night.\n","4":"\n\nThe guns still barking. I had to go with water cart and help fill it, twice, had to get the water from the river as all the water in the wells\n are\n is poisonious. Had a look round Guilly, every house is blown to bits. After tea an attack was made by the Tommies & Yanks on our left, went up on a hill and watched the barrage. It was great watching the Infantry and Guns advancing through Fritz’s shelling. Again slept under the wagon.\n","5":"\n\nWent over to a quarry where 200 Machine guns were captured, saw two dead Fritz’s, one had an ear half eaten off by mice. The Tommies were busy collecting gear that had been left behind in Sailly Laurette. After tea had to go to new gun position with ammunition. At about 10-30 p.m. a couple of Fritz planes came over and dropped a lot of bombs near our wagon lines. 49L MS3 .\n","6":"\n\nOur offensive opened again at 3-30 a.m. Kept up the bombardment all morning.

Got a parcel of smokes from Juniper Green. Shortly after I got into bed a couple of Fritz planes came over and dropped some bombs very close, yes very close.\n","7":"\n\nPut in an easy day. Wrote letters all afternoon. Got two parcels from Aussie, 1 from Wife, 1 from Jack. Fritz came over again in his planes and dropped bombs all round us. Didn’t do any damage, but were very very close, a shower of stones went all over me in my dug out.\n","8":"\n\nRoused out at 3-30 a.m. had to pack up in the dark and clear out to a new position. Passed two big batches of German prisoners\n\ngoing down the line. Camped by the roadside for breakfast and dinner. Moved off again at 2-30 p.m. On the road we passed some German Motors, and two aeroplanes with their wings broken. Went through Bayonvillers and camped near …\n\nAfter I had gone to bed a lot of Tanks came along the road, thought one was going right over us, it came partly over our trench but went back again.\n","9":"\n\nHad an easy day. Went and had a look at a tank that had been burnt in the last stunt. More tanks went up the road to-day. Was shown over one by one of the crew who explained its workings, has six cylinders and generates 150 horse power and travels 12 miles an hour, at top speed. Had another visit from Fritz during the night, one bomb wounded five men and five horses.\n","10":"\n\nSaw some good air fighting, one of ours and two of Fritz’s came down. Got seven letters from Aussie. Had another visit from Fritz and his bombs, thought he was never going to stop dropping them. Never did any damage to our battery.\n","11":"\n\nPut in the morning unloading ammunition and stacking it. After dinner went and had a look at one of our planes that had to come down owing to the engine going wrong. An engine and trucks went up the line (the first I have seen for a long time) to bring back a load of Fritz material, came back with a load of rails. Fritz left us alone during the night, the first time for six nights.\n","12":"\n\nAfter dinner packed up again. Moved off at 2-30 to our new wagon lines. Camped near Harbinage on the side of a hill. On the way down we passed huge dumps of Fritz shells and cartridges. The shells were all sizes, from Whiz-Bangs to 10 inch, standing 2 ft. 6 in. high. The number of prisoners taken during the week is 30,344.\n","13":"\n\nHalf holiday. Wrote letters all afternoon. One of Fritz’s planes brought down one of our baloons in flames. A lot of tanks have been going along the gully all day.\n","14":"\n\nWas awakened early by the firing at Fritz planes overhead. Tom Hall was wounded in the shoulder by machine gun bullet.

Fritz dropped a lot of bombs near us during the night, smashed up a lot of Frenchies.\n","20":"\n\nPacked up, on the move again, going out for a spell. Came down over the ground where the gunners were on Aug. 8th, there is hardly an inch of ground that hasn’t been blown up by shells. Its not to be wondered at that so much damage was done after seeing it, by the side of the road lay what remained of a fritz wagon and team of horses, passed a fair number of graves, both Fritz and our own. Camped at Corbie for the night. Rained heavy early in the night. Sgt. Eng woke up to find he was lying in a pool of water.\n","21":"\n\nOn the move again 8-30 a.m. Came through Corbie, Aubigny, Daours and Foulloy. Camped alongside the swamp at Camon in a big hut.
