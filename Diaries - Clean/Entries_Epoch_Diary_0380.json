After passing through the Gap on Hell's spit we came in the region of strays. A check came & we halted by some carts with a beastly smell. They\n\nturned out to be carts full of dead men. It gave me a shock as I did not know where the burial ground was & it was midnight, with no moon. This trip we went to","50":" Brig right up to about 50 yds from the trenches. The noise was terrific, one incessant rattle & roar. We went back to the beach, & loaded up again & found only 16 mules, the others had sneaked off to bed.

We made a magazine for the Japanese bombs\n\non the track leading to the First Brigade trenches. The bombs were carried from the beach by infantry fatigues as the mules are too rough for them. The men in the trenches say the bombs are something terrific, one Turk having been blown 20 feet in \nthe air spinning\n around.\n","53":" (May) - Finished Bomb Shelter.
