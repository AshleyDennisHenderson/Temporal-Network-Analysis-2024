Did 4 hours together up &\n\nMch 11 down the bank of the canal – distance of 3 miles there & back.\n\nHad to stop all sailing & rowing boats, & kick unauthorised persons into the next world! Many boats passed through – mostly homeward bound, & all had powerful searchlights. Every few moments during the whole of the night the warships, both in the Lakes & the Canal, flashed their searchlights over the desert & the water. Dead sleepy this m’ng. No swim yet, but plenty of chocs & oranges etc. Chaps just dragged for fish with a 40 yard net & snared 1 little tiddler about the size of a matchbox – ‘Great tea’ steak, fried tomatoes, bacon & snifter gravy. May we be here for months & months. Rigged up a swimming jetty close handy. Mill\n","156":" Cool & amp; clear. Nothing doing so am going fishing. Cold as blazes last night. Had a dip, but no luck with the fishing lines. Recd 10 letters & pcs. Feeling \nSunday\n\n12 good. What price fried steak, bacon & tomatoes for brek, & bacon & eggs for tea. Did a good old loaf this afternoon on the pier head with 2 lines, waiting for the fish which never came. Great fun tonight. Halted a Dhow after 6 oclock & put a couple of shots – one into her & another across the bows. You should have seen the niggers duck & ill bet they prayed ‘Allah Allah for hours after. \n","157":" Bayonet practice this m’ng. One fishing line broken. Feeling a bit tired. Harry is on fatigue. Went fishing & swimming but caught nothing as per usual, with the exception of a few hundred mosquito bites. Harry & Rigg have made a raft & are having a good old time paddling round the lakes. What price the OCs for the following; \"There is too much B------- swearing in this Camp\" Roars of laughter from the mob. It appears one of the chaps was annoyed over some\n\nMch 13 thing, & reeled some fiery language off his chest for a rather long period of ‘swearing time’ The name of this post is (Gabal Miriam) \n\nPaddy Murphy is on the Mandolin & she sounds well. \n\n M, HC\n","158":" Plenty of reading matter available, & some buksheesh sox etc. Rather warm today, & plenty of flies & sand-flies. OC has rigged up a few small targets for shooting practice. Naval Launch just pulled up, & officer came ashore, don’t know what for. Arms & legs getting browner every day Warm & clear & hardly a ripple on the surface of the Lake, while along the waters edge the rushes & shrubs are reflected as if in a mirror. Swarms of young fish can be seen close inshore & occasionally a big one leaps out of the water. Did some shooting at 100, & 50 yards. All rifles carry high on a\/c of using mark 6 bullets in Mark 7 \n\nMch 14 rifles. A chap carries his pop-gun with him wherever he goes. Yesty I got half way to the water tank (about 750 yards) & discovered that id left mine at home. These big black sand beetles are characters the way they burrow into the sand, their legs going like one thing, & the sand flying in al directions. There are also several little grey black birds (white breasted) about the camp. They are rather pretty & fairly tame. Eric, R\n","159":" Another beautiful day. Rigged up a good spring board in the canal We are to be inoculated for Trench Typhoid either today or tomorrow. 20th Batt has embarked I believe. Inoculated this afternoon. The OC & the Dr both came down to our little home. Rotten tucker for tea; - biscuits & a couple of boiled eggs. Mafeesh bread.\n","160":" Many sore arms this morning, but mine OK. Expect to leave tomorrow, & embark for France, or England. An officer & several French marines\n\nMch 16 came ashore to trace & fix up a break in a cable line. All our tucker etc is now brought on 2 camels. A native leads them while one of us rides (armed of course) Sand flies are getting worse & the tucker isn’t too good of late.\n","161":" No drill today, am on water fatigue Harry has gone to Serapeum with the camels. OC stated we may leave for France on Sunday the 19th. The canal has gone down about a foot the last few days. Nearly full moon now. Recd 2 letters & 4 papers. One of our chaps went out for a (Camel) Joy ride & a party had to go & look for him. He turned up later though after having a good time at Ismalia. Wales & another chap were on the old raft when she turned turtle & pitched ‘em both into the water & after, to make things worse, W got a chunk of rag caught in his rifle barrel\n","162":" No time to answer any letters as we leave today probably for France. We were awakened about 4 am by \"W\" banging a tin with a huge stick, but it took several more calls & much noise to get us out, & even then a few of us turned in after the tent had been folded. Windy as the devil, & the fine sand stings no end & fills up a fellows ears until he begins to imagine he’s a dredge or a sand dump. Several troopships went through yesty enroute to the Great Bitter Lakes, where we are to embark. Hope those Submarines take a tumble & dont shoot out of their turn. Left at 8.50 am arrived Tad Seon at 10.40 left at 12.50, & arrived Serapeum at 2.30 – distance about 7 miles over the desert & blowing like H---- all the time \n","163":" Rained heavily during the night, & this morning is beautifully cool. Church Parade as usual. Met Taffy Powell & other chaps of the 6\/2 Prince of Wales lobbed along about Sunday\n\nMch 19 11 oclock & of course the mob did its block & cheered no end. Great complexion he has, but he’s only small & doesn’t sit his neddy too well; or perhaps he didnt like the look of the wild Australians. Tommies would have stood still no end, but our mob (bandsmen & all cheered a treat & chased him all over the place. Was wearing 2 stars\n\n(1 Lieut) Managed to get 100 disasters last night, although I was overdrawn some. Not allowed to write any more letters.\n","164":" Going to France tomorrow. OC lectured us this morning. We are to be billeted instead of living under canvas. Messing about all day Kit inspection etc.\n","165":" On baggage guard & its a good job too. Marched from Camp to Railway. Waiting for train to arrive. Dont know what time we leave here. Plenty of beer & other likker at the canteen as well as groceries etc. Just imagine\n\nMch 21 it; a glorious spring night & we of the are bivouacked on the bank of the Suez Canal. Merrily blaze the camp fires against a background of pines & River oaks. Immediately behind is the railway with its siding & splendid lights. Men – hundreds of them pass in & out of the trees & everywhere there is life & movement. To top everything the 3 Batt Band is playing like one thing – and – we had a jolly good tea And this, perhaps will be our last night in the ‘Land of the Pharaohs\" How many of us will ever pass again through the Suez – I wonder?\n","166":" Cold as blazes last night. Left for Alexandria at 1.45 am & did a freeze until about 9 this morning. Travelled on top of baggage in an open truck & minus an overcoat or blankets Bought fresh cooked eggs & bread for breakfast.\n\nMch 22 Leaving by RMS Ivernia. Bonza big ship she is too, does 15 knots an h’r, & expects to reach Marseilles on Monday morning the 27th About 2500 on board. Fair sized gun at the stern. Swopped 100 pts for a sov Secured good 4 berth cabin. Harry is with me. Grub fair so far. Left at 5.30; weather fine & cool.\n","167":" Had a real good nights sleep & turned out about 7.30 Can hardly feel the boat moving \nbut\n she runs so smoothly. Has a slight list to the Sbd side. 4.7 gun & 2 machine guns in the stern, so we are protected fore & aft, & of course there is the look out man, & sentries. Have to take life belts on deck with us. No Canteen yet so my sov is unbroken. Cool & cloudy weather with a fair breeze. Lifebelt & boat parade at 3 pm.\n","168":" Another good night. Reveille at 6.15 but didnt\n\n24 get a move on until after 7 & then only on a\/c of brek. Fine & cloudy; no shipping sighted so far, so evidently we are out of the usual course some No jam available & the other tucker isn’t much catch. Rotten tea only bread & cheese & ½ pt of dishwater & the cheese was enough to make the smallest of rats weep itself to death and this on board a 15,000 ton Cunarder\n","169":" Yarns a treat last night. Lights out at 6.15, so we get plenty of sleep. About a dozen soldiers are employed down under as trimmers & stokers, so the jigger ought to get a move on now. No shipping sighted yet. Just met Bill Crapp of the 1st Batt. He’s looking A1. Land sighted on the Starboard Bow.\n","170":" X Boat on Starboard side. Inoculation last Friday for trench fever, & by gee the Doc shoved the needle well home. Did some washing yesterday. Several promotions out in orders. Sailing ship Sunday\n\nMch 26 passed on Port side, with all sails set & running before a stiff breeze Would like to have had the glasses on her. Church Parade at 9.15 (C of E) Rather cool on deck. S.A. parade this afternoon. Have passed several steamers, & the Gulls circle continually above & around the ship. Land has been in sight the great part of the afternoon. In many places it rises sheer from the waters edge. Here & there are detached rocky islets which form a resting place for myriad sea birds, & occasionally one sees a lighthouse or mayhap a small village the buildings showing white against their greeny brown background. The country appears to be but scantily covered with vegetation & on the summits of the hills beyond \nsmall\nclumps of trees are discernible.\n\n \nSunday\n","171":" Think the tucker & tea must have been dosed last night. Cold &\n\nMch 27 windy this morning. Land in sight & the boat is beginning to rock a bit. Am on baggage guard again. Arrived Toulon (a French Naval Base) about 21.30. Several other troopships in harbour & of course our old band played its d---dest. Rather a pretty place, especially after Egypt. Background of high hills (or rather mountains) covered for the most part with trees, those directly behind the township proper are of a chalklike formation from about midway to their summits, & on these patches trees do not appear to thrive. Naval workshops extend along a great part of the main water frontage, & Perched on the hilltops are several forts which with aid of W.Qs glasses I was able to see fairly plainly. The harbor mouth is rather narrow & is almost closed by a couple of breakwaters. In all, the scenery reminds one of dear old Sydney. The journey\n\nMch 27 from Alexandria took us about 5 days Fairly decent Concert, mouth organ item being the best easily.\n","172":" Not landing at Toulon Left at 6.15 for Marseille Fairly rough sea & we’re hugging the coast. Dull & cold with slight rain Arrived Marseille at 10.45. Poor sort of a harbour, breakwaters must have cost a bit. Beautiful building standing on one of the highest peaks, & crowned by a (golden) figure. Miserable & cold so our impressions of the port are not of the best. Most of the buildings are roofed with tiles, & the private places remind one of Sydney. Toulon is a much prettier port, as there appears to be little greenery here. Orange sellers, musicians, (mostly of the concertina sort) 2 contortionists – young girls, French, English & Indian soldiers, & the usual hangers on & urchins. The boys throw their money on to the \n\nMch 28 wharf & the natives throw the oranges up. Leaving at 4 pm. On baggage guard. Entrained for St Omar (about 3 days trip) just after dark. Saw a number of German prisoners, some smiling but the majority sullen. short & thick set they are some burly chaps. Good gaslight aboard, passed through several tunnels, long & short.\n","173":" (8 in this carriage (3rd class but fairly decent). Slept fairly well, legs on one seat & head on the other. Passed through glorious country (hilly) words fail utterly to adequately describe the Beautiful scenery. Have been gradually ascending & about 2 oclock reached the highest point way up the mountains. Here & there were patches of snow especially among the pine forests where the morning sun had failed to penetrate. Way down – hundreds of feet below \nwere the\n villages\n\nMch 29 scattered hamlets, roads, rivers etc etc passed before the eye in one lovely panarama, & then the train would dive into a long tunnel & all would be dark & dismal. After reaching the highest point the speed swiftly increased & we swept downhill & round corners at a great rate, doing at times as much as 50 miles an hour.\n\nGradually the clouds gathered, old Sol disappeared, & a misty rain swept over us, but it was only temporary, although the air was chilly no end & we covered up & snuggled into our coats. The people are invariably polite & most of them are kindness personified. At Lyons they gave us fruits & bread gratis, & the boys threw down badges etc which were eagerly picked up. Very few young men on the farms, most of the work being done by old men & women. The young women are mostly good looking & all of\n","174":" them have nice complexions just like the English. The Red Cross gave us hot water & soup, & several times I made cocoa (Cadburys too) a chap can always get hot water from the Engine. Nearly all the land is intensely cultivated, including even steep hillsides where it seems almost impossible to use a horse & plow. Chaps are behaving pretty well, one rotter who tried a dirty trick got biffed by the boys. The pine forests remind one of the Dorrigo pines, except that the latter cover mile upon mile of flat country whereas here they are chiefly found on the hills; Although there are many patches on the level country.\n","175":" Slept badly last night. Nice hot tea was dished out about 2 am but the rum was missing A couple of French planes have passed overhead one coming low down. Noticed several old castles chiefly among the mountains – some of them well preserved, & others crumbling to ruin\n\nMch 31 There are hundreds of trees almost completely covered with ivy, & a certain other parasitical (bird-nest) growth which is rather common in \nAustralia\n In many cases the ground itself (beneath the trees) is matted with ivy. Passed Paris in the distance about 1 or 2 pm, & what appeared to be the Eiffel Tower. The country here (after crossing the ranges) is mostly flat, or undulating, & of course few of the trees & hedges are yet showing their spring leaves – with the exception perhaps of fruit trees. \n\nThe roads are excellent, the best ive had the pleasure of seeing & everywhere railways intersect the countryside. Most of the 2nd Division is in France & we arrived \nhere\n this morning about 4.30 & detrained within sound of the guns – whose sullen booming could be heard dully through the thick fog blanket. \"We’re getting closer & closer.\" A Coy is temporary billeted in a Renescure\n\nMch 31 big farmhouse about 15 miles from the trenches & 4½ from St Omer. Our possie is a machine shed; damp floor, & little, or no, straw, but one doesn’t mind, because the surroundings are beautiful (so different to Egypt) We went to a small village where the Tommies are billeted, & then marched back here with the old band ahead playing like one thing. Bully-beef, biscuits & jam for brek, but plenty of planes to gaze at, & a couple of nice girls – (but what are 2 among so many). Secured a tin & a small bucket, & dipped some water out of the pond & got rid of much dirt. Must shave later on. Jolly heavy frost here. All people employed by or serving the Military wear a yellow arm- badge as a distinguishing mark. Hard luck for us; the Tommies got into the Village ahead of us. Harry & I went to the village & made sundry purchases & swigged some wine Beautiful bread, about 5 lbs\n\nweight for 8’, & nice dairy butter at 1\/3 a pound. The wine is 10d a bottle & tastes good, but rather bitter. Fair sized village & a fine big Church. Had cold bath\n","176":"\n Got hold of some straw last night & made a decent bed although we slept a little cold. Turned out fairly early and went for a sprint down to the village Heavy frost but felt tip top after my run. Just like August in Aust, & reminds me of the long past winter mornings when Mont & I used to go for a long walk over the hills of dear old Tamworth. Only tea \n& tea\n for brek. Trains rush past every few minutes – passenger, military, red-cross & goods, & some of them travel too, as most of the lines are built for speed & being wide gauge (5ft) the rocking is barely noticeable. There are a great number of Nord Engines with big driving wheels. Have noticed a few hares & rabbits but not many birds (too cold yet)\n\nApl 1 Several of the boys were in a state of shik last night, some just harmlessly maudlin & others aggresively drunk. Its a pity of course, but then the boys havn’t had any booze for weeks\n\nThe English say there will be one big drive this month or next & that we’ll be right in it. \"No chats yet\" Route march this morning for a couple of hours through gloriously green country & along good roads. A little drill about 2 oclock & then a foot inspection. Shifted camp to another, & much better barn\n\n2 Slept warm & soundly last night on a straw bed. Beautiful morning; very little frost. Church Parade at 10.15; in the meantime the boys are playing miniature cricket & enjoying themselves no end. Some coot pinched our bread yesterday, so I had to go to the village for more or else eat biscuits Likker is some cheap; beer 1 glass rum 2, & wine 4, or 10 a bottle The beer is very light. None of the buildings about here \n\n \nSunday\n","177":" appear to have been bombarded but there are lines of trenches scattered here & there. A Taube came over not long since, bombed the village & killed 7 civvys but no soldiers. We are about 60 miles from England & 60 feet from the Railway. As the rattlers rush past the old barn fairly quivers, the vibration being specially noticeable when one is lying down. Bacon on the Menu for brek. The Englishmen in our forces are unstinted in their praise of France, & all agree that although is beautiful this is better, & there is much more of it. Nearly all the buildings are tile roofed, & most of the walls are covered with plaster, although there are a fair number of plain brick buildings & not a few slate roofs. Of iron I’ve seen not any. Inspected the RC Church yesty. All the seats are turned from the pulpit & a great number of them have the owners name printed on the back. Fairly heavy bombardment proceeding this\n\nApl 2 morning while we were at Church (Some of the roads are made of square stone blocks (about 4 x 4), & the edges are lined with metal. Went for a long walk this afternoon passing along the Canal enroute while several Tommies & some of our chaps were fishing & swimming. Guess the water was rather cool too much so for this chick. Nearly all flat or undulating country in this vicinity, & well cultivated it is too. The hedges are just beginning to shoot, as also are most of the trees. Nearly every kiddy one meets in the street is anxious to get a Souvinir, but the boys are just about cleaned out, & stony too for that matter. Rather long twilight; can read till after 7. Special coal on the trains :- (oblong blocks) which emits very little black smoke. Jolly good Concert tonight. Band being present A large fire was lighted in the courtyard, chairs were placed for the ladies, the boys assembled round\n\nApl 2 & we had a real good time. Luckily no Taubes sighted us\n\n3 Turned out about 7.15. parade 9 to12, plenty of bayonet fighting, & had to muck about with my puttees & put them on Regimentally. Getting warmer every day. Looks as if we are going to stay here for a while as the Batt is connected by phone. Route march for 1½ hrs in the afternoon; jolly fine going too, didn’t change step all the way, but worked up a sweat. Went for a stroll after tea; Harry played a game of Soccer on the green & we finished up at the Village. The Port Wine isnt half bad. On our way home we were stopped by ‘Sticky\" The Major – who wanted to know what we were doing out after 7 pm. Night march to the square in absolute quiet just to test us, & the boys behaved well. On the return march we whistled & sang to our\n","178":" hearts content.\n","179":" Slept heavy & late, woke up just in time to get the usual tea & tea. Its a damned disgrace expecting the men to drill on tea & bread, & I’ll wager my pay to a disaster that the officers feed well. But its always the same, the man who gives his all & runs the greatest risk gets absolutely rotten treatment. Cold & windy this mng. More rain I guess. ‘Sticky’ was pleased with our bearing last night & promised us a half holiday today & possibly - \"pay\"\n\nA couple of the chaps played up in the Village & I believe they are to be severely dealt with. Been writing letters all the afternoon, while most of the boys played cricket, & football or mucked up generally in the barnyard. \n\n \nEng\n M, Essie, HC, AD, AH, Eily \n\n5 Pay day Friday, 40 Francs; £ 1-08-8 & not before its wanted either. The Tucker is beginning to improve a \n\n Eng. M. Ess HC AD AH Eily\n","180":" but it wants to be a lot better yet. Another chilly day, but no rain. Went out with Grenadiers & threw bricks & chunks of metal for 2 or 3 hours. Believe the live bombs are to arrive later on. 22 days to live is the limit for a Grenadier so it looks as if I’m in for a fairly warm time. The tucker has been rotten of late, so the boys paraded today & now there is a distinct improvement. Concert in the School Hall by the Tommies & it wasn’t half bad either. Issued with an extra blanket, so we will cease to shiver. R \n","181":" old thing, cold & cloudy. Our water supply has run out:– the well is empty so we have to carry water from another farm about 3 or 4 hundred yards distant. Pay dished out this afternoon instead of tomorrow so I imshied & bought sundry articles. Several of the chaps were in a state of Shik\n\n6 & didnt turn up for the march (night). Spose they’ll get roared on Slight touch of Dysentery took a few anti pills. A Taube bombed the 1st Batt while they were out marching, but did no damage.\n\n7 2 gas protectors per man were handed round this morning & we then marched 2 or 3 miles to a trench where the whole brigade donned their helmets & walked in a single file through the trench full of gas. The helmets were then taken off & we passed through another trench where a \"Weeping Gas Bomb\" had been exploded and by gee it made my eyes smart & water \n\nHeavy rain last night; dull & chilly today. Wonder will the sun ever come out? Several of our chaps are to visit the firing line for 2 days & they must wear caps Trainloads of troops are continually passing & there were some Canadians\n","182":" aboard the last one. Most of the Engines use coal (in oblong blocks) which does not emit black smoke, but it pongs some. It’s a damned disgrace the way we (volunteers) are treated. Bread & tea for brek, no dinner, & the following for 24 hours dry ration, ¼ loaf bread, 1 oz cheese, no jam & no butter, and thats what we get for doing our bit, anyhow 7 of us vamoosed bought 7 lbs of steak fried it at a wine shop, & then wired in: - Steaks, bread & butter, coffee, cakes, wine & cigarettes, & the whole lot cost only about 2 francs each (1\/8). Paraded to the officers but got nil, guess they tucker well though.\n\n8 Kit bags going to base depot, & we are leaving here next week. Several chaps before Orderly Room today, chiefly for being late on parade. Rotten breakfast, only bully beef bread & tea. Great feed for 3 hours drill. All peninsula hands are on water fatigue while\n","183":" the others go shooting Good job it is too; only have to carry a couple of dixies apiece & then Mafeesh. Rec’d 6 letters & a pc from Australia & 1 letter from England Did some washing & dashed near froze my fingers. About 2 pm a Fokker plane (German) Flew low down over our quarters, when the engine went bung & he volplaned about 2 miles over the village into ploughed ground where he struck an old trench. One unarmed Tommy was bailed up, but armed men were quickly on the scene & the Hun was captured, but not until he made an attempt to wreck the plane whereat a shot whizzed past him. The machine (which is only three weeks old) is the latest type Fokker armed with a machine gun facing the propeller & the aeronaut was on his last trip previous to getting a Captains Commission. Harry & had a good look at her, & I guess we’ll know Mill\n\nApl 8 the next one as she is marked with 8 black crosses on white grounds Only a single hollow canvas plane, beautiful engine, fairly long tail held up by steel supports, 2 pneumatic wheels under the main body – which is of a sort of marked – aluminium, & single seated. The MG is controlled by the propellor blades which it fires past but does not hit. Everything is intact so I guess we wont be long in getting a few Fokkers going. The chap who made the Capture is a \"Tommy – Cook\", & I believe gets a months leave, & a reward \"Lucky devil\"\n\n9 Chewing kisses yesty & a filling pulled out. Stiff luck today on BHQ guard from 9 am to 7 pm 2 hrs on & 4 off. Went on from 9 to 11 & chucked a few salutes & presents to sundry officers & armed parties Weather as usual, cloudy & cold. Batt leaves for ----- tomorrow morning; closer to the firing line I think. Sunday\n","184":" Patent beer carts here 2 long stout poles about 24 ins apart are fastened to an iron axle to which is attached the wheels. The poles serve at the same time as shafts & the beer barrels (from 5 to 9) are placed between. Well built & comfortable farmhouses, but the pits & dams etc are almost invariably placed right against the house, consequently one gets a not too pleasant odour in many instances. fruit trees are trained along the walls just like we train a grape vine, & the effect should be rather pretty when the leaves are right out. Many of the men & boys wear black peaked caps similar to those worn by a motor driver. Guard finished at 7 pm & we had to pack our kit as soon as we returned to camp \n\n \nSunday\n\n10 Left Renescure at 7 am for Uttersteene & picked up the rest of the Brigade enroute. Marched over 3 hours without a spell; many of the chaps fell out & \n","185":" were picked up by Red Cross or Transports. Passed a fairly big town called Hazelbrook, & no end of traffic on the road. Motors of all sorts, cavalry, cycle corps’, pedestrians, carts sulkies & buggies passed us in one long stream. Guess theres a blister on my heel & the perspiration & all is oozing through my boots The weather is fine & cool; Heavy artillery bombardment towards which we are apparently getting closer & closer. Passed by General Walker & another head. Arrived Uttersteene at 1 pm which means a 6 hour march, full pack up with only 40 minutes spell. We were expected at 4 pm & I believe there’s going to be an inquiry into the matter. Did from 15 to 17 miles, & there were some blistered feet (mine were sore at any rate) Many of the boys dropped out, & not a few visited the wine shops. Our possie is as usual, a barn & not a patch on the \n\nApl 10 last one either. Just about 10 miles from the firing line. Good pond of water just behind us, plenty of straw in the barn, also numerous rats & mice, a pub 50 odd yards away, & several graves (soldiers) scattered here & there. Must pay a visit to the township about a mile distant. \n\nWashed my feet etc took off my sweat soaked shirt & sox, in fact had a good clean up, & am feeling good. Can see two observation balloons, & 1st Army H.Q. is about 2 miles away. Had a bonsa hot shower & Harry changed his clothes & got clean ones; great idea it is – there are a number of Belgian refugees doing nothing else but wash & iron clothes.\n\n11 Guess we are getting close to Belgium, as there are several old Dutch wind-mills scattered here & there (just the sort you see on picture post cards) woke up this morning to the accompaniment of big\n","186":" guns, roosters, bugs, mice, rats, a yelling kiddie & - \"Kelly\" –\n\nNo bath parade today on a\/c of a Div’ inspection so we cleaned up the farm-yard; & it was \nsome\n mucky too after rain. Have to carry gas helmets on a\/c of aerial gas bombs. The mice are so numerous that they parade in platoons & companies, & even march in columns of route, but owing to lack of rafter- width they are exempted from forming fours.\n\nThe big guns are beginning to speak to some purpose, guess the big bombardment has commenced in deadly earnest. Reckon id sooner be in a charge than under fire in a trench, specially if the big naval guns were at it.\n\n12 Turned out at 6.30 this morning – full marching order – for inspection by General Walker, & by gee we did a freeze for an hour or so. They say this is Spring, but I reckon its more like midwinter. Not a bad\n","187":" sort of chap this Walker. The Huns sent a rather impolite message to the 2nd Div’, so s’pose they’ll be presenting us with a similar one. Drunk 3 glasses of milk yesty (at 1 per glass) & 3 more this m’ng. Even the children drink the beer in this country & they thrive on it too \n\nA Taube dropped a few bombs close by, & burnt 2 laundry sheds. \n\nHope they don’t take a liking to our barn. This district is full of spies’, men, women & children, & one cannot trust any of them. Sergt has been telling us about the trenches we are to occupy shortly, & it seems to me that the Huns have the Tommies bluffed. Its up to us to bluff Mr Hun & show him a few points. M\n\n13 On Dental parade today & it’s a good move too, seeing that theres a full pack route march on. Marched about a mile or so to the Dentists. There a several rather nice girls\n","188":" in the house & they aren’t exactly shy either Do me I guess. Old Sol is trying his damnedest to warm us a little, but the wind & clouds get the upper hand too often. Egypt was the land of sand, but this is a land of mud, nice, black, squelchy stuff. The old Doc isn’t a bad sort, & will always give a chap a hearing ----\n\nTemporary filling put in; have to return next week for a permanent filling. Had a warm shower, got a clean change & am feeling A1. \n\n14 Shifted our quarters this morning to another barn about \n\n200 yd’s away, & had to pack blankets & all; they \n\ncouldn’t let us carry our blankets under our arms – \"Oh no\" –\n\nRain interfered with drill, but we go for a route March this afternoon, & No 3 platoon goes into, or near the firing line tom’w m’ng. No cigarettes dished out:- only 1 box of matches a man & 1 pipe per section Went into the Village of Ada, Sax, Eng. \n","189":" Meteren last night & had a look round. There are scores of motor transports all over the place, & all sorts of troops:- Tommies, Canadians, Frenchies, Scots, & Australians. Bough a tin of boot polish (small size) for 1½. Been amusing ourselves looking at an old sow & her litter of 9 silky little piglets. You should have seen them at feeding time. There are 2 rows of teats (12 in all) & by gee they made the pace a welter. After a few minutes their bellies were swollen properly & the old sow was getting a bit uneasy. (No wonder either, with 9 of the young beggars draining the life out of her – Talk about mud, this place is a regular quagmire. An hours route marching after dinner (full pack) with the band in front. On our way back there was a light fall of snow & sleet & rain & we dashed near froze. Too cold for me this France\n","190":" Cold as blazes, but still we slept warm all night. Slight fall of snow which has apparently cleared things a little. On Dental parade again & got another temporary filling. Have to return on Monday at 2.30 but we may not be here then: Bomb throwing after dinner; picked up several bombs & grenades & practiced with them for an hour or so. Like the Mills bomb the best, although the old cricket ball isn’t half bad. Saw some very neat snipers possies for the first time. \n\nConcert at the YMCA was A1 although old Mac the Chaplain was largely responsible for its success. He’s a K.Nut is Mac, & knows just how to deal with soldiers. The 3rd Batt Band played several selections, & played them well too. – (Just as all the crowd had settled down for the night Cpl Clegg (in a state of shik) woke the echoes, &\n\nApl 15 incidentally roars & laughter from the mob, by trying to sing \"My Mary\". Shortly after Jack the Cook woke us all up with the information that sundry swine had bombarded the cook house, & that unless an armed guard was supplied \"per see\" the Chief Chef would decline all responsibility for the Companys breakfast. The tucker in question I might add was – \"pork\". A couple of nights since the same swine ate our ration of pork & for brek we had \"tea & tea\" – (At first the boys fairly laughed the cook out of sight) but, becoming duly impressed with the importance of saving their grub, 2 volunteers hopped out & brought the scran inside out of harms way. Our noble friend \nHarry\n was one of the heroes, & so fatigued & hungry was he after such strenuous labor that he forthwith ate much bread & jam & even the fact that I plonked my foot & half\n\nApl 15 a blanket on to his tucker didn’t worry him overmuch. After more songs etc we turned in for good.\n\n16 got up this morning just in time to miss all the pork (just our rotten luck) so had to open up a tin of Maconochies. Generals Birdwood (Com’ Aust Army) & Walker were present at this mornings Church Parade, but said nil. They are now inspecting the 3rd Batt. \n\n Visited St Waasts Cathedral Bailleul. It’s a beautiful building, the windows & pipe organ being especially fine. The door leading to the belfry was smashed in by the huns & one can see the broken woodwork which has been patched up. There are several large fine old pictures but owing the dim light, & faded state of the canvas, I could only make out dim outlines of figures. The musty atmosphere, caused by incense & lack of ven- \n\n \nSunday\n, R\n\nApl 16 tilation was almost stifling. Bailleul is a fairly large & very busy town & full of soldiers. The cobbles beat me though, too hard on a chaps feet. Every street of any importance is full of motors of all descriptions. Watched several interesting air fights between machines & anti-aircraft guns. Stood by an aerodrome & saw at least 7 planes & 2 balloons in the air at the same time, & the big guns were speaking now & then. Had tea at the YMCA & then strolled home, where a letter from Isabel awaited me, and Harry wanted to pinch the photo, but \"Mafeesh\". (The blackbirds called from hedges, as we wandered slowly by. We three of the 6th of the 2nd, Harry, Taffy & I. Now Harry’s a staunch New Zealander, Taffy – a Welshman bold, and I – well, im an Australian, whose feet have not yet grown cold.)\n\nTaffy & self are both bombers now, & Harry has promised to provide a fitting burial ---. ","191":"\n","192":" On Dental parade for the last time. Understand we go forward to the firing line tomorrow. Still more rain; wonder will it ever take a tumble & give old Sol a chance. Yesty was a glorious day, fine & clear with a gentle breeze. Bombers parade but I paid a visit to my friend the Dentist. Tomorrow we leave for Armentiere. Called out about 9 oclock tonight as special picket. Dressed in the dark & then marched 3 or 4 miles over hard roads & through sloppy mud for – nothing and didn’t we squeal ‘Oh No’. Lobbed home a couple of hr’s later & had a good tuck in\n\n18 left for Sailly at 12 & arrived at 3 after an 8 or 9 mile trudge through mud varying from 1 to 12 ins in depth, (with a couple of spells enroute) Saw a partially ruined Church which had evidently been struck by an incendiary bomb Drizzling rain fell most of the time & Sailly\n","193":" during the spells a fellow had to either lie down on the damp mud or grass, or else stand up spreadeagle fashion, pack supported by rifle. Yes we are well acquainted with sunny France & its beautiful roads & wayside hostels for weary travellers. As for us well we trudge on & on with sore feet & aching shoulders through the everlasting mud. But what matters it; we are here to do our bit, & by – we’ll do it too, & anyhow this little barn is one of the best yet. Harry & I put in for Wireless vacancies but don’t think we were successful. Australians can take a tip from the French in the dog line. Have seen them here pulling little carts (milk & pastry mostly), & turning a huge wheel. The dog is placed inside the wheel & once he gets a start on has to keep going to keep on his feet . The power thus derived is used for churning &\n\nApl 18 other purposes. The old windmills are some size – something like 40 feet from end to end of the huge fan of which there are two. Paid 40 francs. Harry went to town, but before leaving we broke a bottle of champagne\n\n19 Raining all night. Got up late this m’ng, & bought sundry choc’s etc; Leaving for the trenches this afternoon. Went to Estaires with Harry & had a good time; bought sundry articles & had dinner Fair sized town this & plenty of girls about. Spotted one spy first go but he imshied. Several buildings are shell marked. Met a real nice old F – lady, who took us into her house & entertained us with wine, champagne & biscuits. She said the Australians were so delightfully free & easy.\n\nLeft for the trenches at 4.45 & arrived about 8.45 after travelling for miles through mud & over duck boards. Shells\n","194":" burst a few hundred yards to our left just near a gun possie. Oh it was great fun coming through the Comm’ trenches in the dark – falling off now & then into a foot or so of mud & water, & slipping & sliding all over the place Every few seconds a flare would go up & occasionally we’d have to duck as the parapets aren’t very high & bullets don’t mind where they go. The guns & trench mortars were dead quiet but even so we strafed the Kaiser no end. Harry & I went on post straight away & did a freeze the whole blessed night. Talk about mud & rain, it would break your heart at any other time. 2 hrs on & 1 off is the roster just now at night, & sleep in the daytime – perhaps.\n\n20 The Dinkums are on our left & have had a few casualties already although this part of the line is dead quiet. Have to cook your own grub in this joint. Harry made the tea this \n\n \nArmentieres\n \nLines\n (Fleur Bay) \n","195":" morning & I helped to drink it. Very few chats, but plenty of mice big rats knocking round. Short rations today on a\/c of ours getting lost or something. A few fellows feet are always cold, & very often wet. Must have a screw at Fritz’s trenches later on. Had a great dinner which we cooked ourselves. Fried steak, done to a turn, fried bread, butter Jam, cheese, & tea. Then washed a little of the mud of my noble person & cleaned my teeth. The dugouts aren’t bad & it would take a fair sized shell to settle them. They hold from 1 to 6 men but a chap gets little sleep at night as he’s on duty all night & off during the day. The chaps we relieved are called the \"Bantams\" or the Lancashire fusiliers & have a dugout on our own now. Just big enough for two & fairly warm too. Gee, the rats are large, dashed near as big as a cat & jolly chunky too. One would hardly\n\nApl 20 know there was a war on, everything is so quiet; although there are about a thousand guns within a few miles radius. Good tucker today & self cooked. Steak, fried & maconochies in a stew for tea. Very little wood supplied, so one has to forage along the trenches, & get dry or wet stuff.\n","196":" German anti-air guns wasted about 150 to 200 shells on one of our planes & now they’re after another Looks A1, the shells bursting all round the machine & yet missing it. Rain & still more rain & cold, it would fairly freeze a fellow to death. Believe Fritz has sustained big reverses in Russia & at Verdun Little or nothing doing here, in fact it’s a home from home, only for the mud & cold rain. A couple of loop holes put in tonight for sniping & observing during the day. \nEaster Friday\n\n22 Rotten night last night, only just woke up – 12.30 pm. Recd 2 letters from Eng & Aust. Things are dead quiet –\n","197":" On post all night 2 hrs on & 1 hr off, came off dead tired after having practically no sleep & had to go on fatigue. Walked 5 or 6 miles over duckboards & through muddy fields & slushy roads. Now & then a bullet would whiz by – especially when we were crossing the open country. On arrival at the Rail-head the R.Es refused to hand over any material, so we bought chocolate & bread, collected all spare wood available & made for home again. Got back just in time to have tea & go on duty. Our Dr reckons the men can’t stand the hardships so we may go out shortly\n\n23. Had a fairly good night, but had to go on duty again at 5 am. Just at dawn a lark soared up above our \"little wet home\" & our feathered friends in the trees behind the firing line started their morning song. Sad to relate A Coy had its first casualty shortly \nSunday\n","198":" after, when a private was killed by a bullet through the head. Evidently he exposed himself too much. Had a great tuck in for brek’, Fried bacon tea, bread, toast, jam & butter & am feeling good. Plenty of coal & wood, so warmed our dugout up last night & things were A1; a real home in fact. Fine weather for about the 2nd time in 6 months, but the guns are fetching the rain again. These aeronauts of ours are dead game. They fly low down over the German Lines despite a rain of machine gun & rifle bullets & scores of bursting shells. The \"Mad Major\", artillery observers the gamest of the lot. Bit of a bombardment this afternoon but nothing serious. Harry has a telescopic rifle & does a bit of a sniping now & then.\n\n Easter Sunday\n\n24 Fairly rotten night, feet sore as blazes. One of our chaps in C Coy was wounded in the ankle Woods & I were in our\n","199":" dugout, when a mine exploded & shook the whole parapet, & then sundry bombs went off & livened things up a bit. The Huns blew out one or two of our guns, & exploded an ammunition store, but we caught their spy. Our planes are busy over the enemies lines & several hundred shots have been wasted on them. Must write a few letters shortly. Another mine or else a big bomb exploded & shook things a bit The Huns charged the 28 Batt & our boys went over to meet them. It was a silly thing to do as our machine guns had to play on our own men to keep the Huns down. Pc M\n\n25 Beautiful day, in fact its damned hot. Had a real good wash & then got the dinner ready. Flies are beginning to buzz round & chats give one hurry up night & day ----\n\nLater Wounded in head & left eye at 3.30 pm by Anniv of Gallipoli landing\n","200":" German sniper. Just put my rifle through the loophole & was drawing a bead on him when – Bang – his bullet smashed on to the iron plate of my loophole. Hardly knew what had happened at first but the blood soon put me wise Stretcher Bearers bound up my nut & poor old Harry rushed out of our dugout (not knowing how badly I might have got it)\n\nWalked a mile or two to the AMC where the wound was washed & dressed & then tramped a couple more miles to the Motor ambulance which took us to an Aust Hosp where the wound was again washed & dressed & I was blanketed & given hot water bottles. Went from there to an Eng Hosp at Merville where 2 or 3 Docs examined the eye. Am afraid it wont be much good to me again –\n","201":" Had a jolly bad night but feeling much better today except for the pain in the eye. Must try & Cable to Mum. Expect to leave for the Aust Base Hosp today. This Hosp is in a beautiful big Church so you can guess the light isn’t much good, & the atmosphere is rather depressing. Several of the 9 Batt in here some of them badly wounded. Everybody has treated me excellently so far.\n\nLeft for Boulogne by special motor, a distance of 60 miles & arrived at the eye Hosp 4 hrs later. The Doc informed me that my left eye is useless so hes taking it out tomorrow morning. \n\n 13th Stationary Boulogne \nMerville Hosp\n\n27 Slept very badly last night, but feeling fairly good this mng.

Hope to see them shortly. Guess im finished now as far as war is concerned. Expect to leave for Eng shortly & then for Dear old Australia Theres a Canadian on my right but nearly all the other chaps are Tommies. The Orderlies are rather too fond of showing their authority, although they’re not bad chaps. My bed seems to trouble the Head Sister greatly as she is most correct & im rather restless & inclined to kick the clothes off & generally muck up. We have one Semi-Aust Nurse who is a bit of a sport\n\n Anophthalmos Excision\n\n28 Had my left eye taken out yesty afternoon & slept fairly well despite a rotten toothache. The anaesthetic didn’t worry we much; just a sort\n","203":" of tingling sensation all over, ringing of bells at the head & felt a slight tightening of the chest. Feel OK this morning, except that the bandage presses on the eye & makes it feel a bit crook. Had a nice warm bath & a shave, & am feeling tip top. The Doc says im to go to London in a few days time. Do me every time. No drinking water available so you can understand how dry we are. Just finished half a doz letters. Not bad for a one-eyed chap. What? Its a case of the blind helping the blind in this joint.\n\nMy no is 5, & I am apptd to look after No 6 who has lost most of his left hand & is injured in 2 eyes.

Believe Australians don’t go to London. Rotten luck for me. Must apply for leave from H Qs. Made my own bed today as all fit patients do. Also did some dusting & incidentally a skirmish with the Matron. Met another Aust cobber from the 2nd FA. He says we travel overland to Marseille & embark there for Australia. Wrote to Andy Fisher re leave of absence to England. C of E Parson came round & I told him I was a freethinking Australian. Lovely weather the last few days & its great, lying on the green grass out in the glorious sunshine. Can see part of the Harbor & the piers from the back of the Hospital & now & again a train rattles past on our left.\n\nApl 30 Sunday today, & some of the boys have gone to C of E early Communion which is held at 6.30, as for me I must get busy & write a few more letters else my friends will be thinking I’ve passed it in. Asked the Colonel about a cable but he doesn’t appear to Compree, so have posted it to Uncle Jim. My present wealth amounts to 22 odd Francs but cant get out to spend any of it. At the 1st F.A. on the 26th the Doc inoculated me in the stomach; what for I havnt the least idea. Yesterday, because I did’nt stand up all the time the Doc was in the Ward the old cat of a Matron went dead sore; & today she did her block because I spoke to the Canadian next to me.\n\n‘Talk about rough’. These Tommy Hospitals are the dead limit & I’ll be damn glad to get away. The buildings are of iron & lined with a sort of smooth iron.

Centre table with green & white tiled top & with brass edging, & several small tables acting as stands for flowers & ferns. Had a nice hot bath but unluckily attempted to blow my nose; thought my head had come off, by the jar it gave my eye. Told the C of E parson I was an Aust Freethinker, & he sheered off. Been sitting at the main entrance gazing out to sea & watching the nice girls go past, & they are nice too.\n","206":" Cloudy & cool. Chaps keep coming & going. There are several Australian Sisters giving a hand in this Hospital. Met one this morning. A fellow cant even look out of the main entrance gate now. The D— Tommy police block him. Stone the crows I don’t want to be in any more of their Hospitals. There’s a Canadian on my left whose speech is very like that of Uncle Albert. I’m going over to Blighty (home)\n\n R\n\nMay 1 is a favourite saying of Tommies & Canadians\n","207":" Several cases came in last night, some suffering from gas. Appears that Fritz has been using gas all along the line. Wonder when our guns will open up, & our mines begin to roar? During my short 6 days \nin\n, they hardly spoke at all – despite the fact that the Huns shelled our reserves & supports every day, & got a fair number two – including some munitions & a gun or two. Can’t understand why civies are allowed so close to the firing line, because half of them are spies, in the pay of the Hun. Rather heavy rain this mng, accompanied by thunder & lightening, but its over now & everythings beautifully cool. A fellow cant wander far in this Caboose, why, if you even go near the gate an MP is sure to go crook, & I told one of em off t’other day, but don’t spose that helped any.\n\n3 No parcels or letters yet, \n","208":" but they may turn up later. Never know your luck. Believe im to go to Marseille although the Doc has said nothing yet. Cold & dull all day. Ward gradually being cleared out – possibly in view of the big offensive. Been polishing the floor & feeding the bed patients, & etc; helps to fill in the time. The Leather Hosp slippers have no backs & I cant manipulate them, so Nurse presented me with a pair of size 12 green & red slippers, & gave me strict instructions not to use them outside, & of course I don’t. Oh No! Anyhow they do stay on mostly, although I look more like a ‘Roo than ever.

Believe our boys were in the firing line for 14 or 15 days & are now in supports. Hope Harry is OK. Have written Jack Curtis. Rather pretty sight on the Harbor, the Hospital ship steaming out, several little fishing smacks dotted here & there, the long dark line of the breakers & a couple of destroyers. Can almost see the old Country across the water the weather is so fine & clear. Got a pipe today from the Matron had a few puffs & then gave it & the bacca to one of the other patients. Still hanging to my cigs though would like to get hold of those cigars from Australia. See that our Navy has doused a couple more Zeps. Good luck to ‘em.

Believe there was Church but I was busy watching the promenaders and admiring the ladies. Had a hot-cold shower just the thing to buck a fellow up. Sunday\n\n8 Leaving here today, I am not sorry either. Will do a chap good to get out & stretch his legs. Tommy togs dished out to me, not a bad fit, but will be pleased to get our own at Base.

We are allowed off from 4.30 to 8.30 but must be here in the tent by 9. 10 of us in here including Canadians, Africans, English & Australians, & they’re a fairly decent crowd. Boulogne itself is rather pretty especially round about the Cathedral & Park where the fine old elms are showing their spring leaves. We went down per tram (there are some stiff gradients too) but walked back – a distance of about 2 miles. Struck it lucky at the Canadian pay office & got 25 Francs, so am now financial: – (40F) Some of our chaps are booked for Aust, but I believe a glass-eyed Tommy was sent back to the Trenches. \n\nHours are as follows – Reveille 5.30, brek 6 am Marlboro’ Camp\n\nMay 8 fall in 6.45, dinner 12, fall in 1 pm, tea at 4 pm.

Tea, ham, bread butter & jam for brek, & then we fell in for Roll Call. This chick was put on fatigue cleaning up the lines, but he didn’t do very much cleaning up. Fell in at 10 for sick parade & heard what the Quack has to say for himself. Not a bad Canteen, tea etc ‘1, & cakes 1½ each. Women from England are running it. Theres a \"Gussy\" Eng’ Cpl; on my right but he’s going away today. Went before the Doc at 10.30 & have to be boarded in a couple of days. Hope to get through OK. Went down town again in the rain & had a look round. Cant see too much though with only one eye.\n","215":" Did a bit of a shiver last night. Fine, cold & cloudy today, with the prospect of more rain very shortly. Am exempted from fatigues, feeling fairly good, but must have a shave & a bath shortly. Bought my grub at the Canteen as usual, its cheap & good. More Australians came in today. The Sgts here are a pretty rotten lot, but our boys are telling them off & knocking a damn lot of the sauce out of them. Had a shave down town, got the nails taken out of my boots, & a pair of rubbers fastened on. Could not find the Y.M.C.A to get a bath but ran across a Wesleyan Chapel where sundry refreshments were procurable. \n\n (Eng), M\n\n11 Bit of an argument in the tent last night, & a cockney had most to say.

Well drained camp this. No chance of being\n","216":" flooded out, & its run better than our Aust Detail Camps. In front is the Canadian Hosp surrounded by a low stone wall & a small forest of trees – mostly elms. On the left – Canadian Conv Camp, on the right the main road & a British Conv Camp, & to the rear, ploughed ground & several clumps of trees. The boys are playing a friendly game of cricket & causing a little amusement. Occasionally the ball lobs on a tent & of course the occupants do a bit of a roar – or else \"duck\". Two of my cobbers left today for the Destructor. Did a bit of dusting at the Canteen, & then played Bobs? for a while. Went for a stroll to No 13 Hosp & got a letter which arrived ye’sty from Ethel. Also visited Nap’s Monument but was too late to go up top. The surrounding gardens are lovely & on the way to & from Hosp I had some lovely views of the ocean, & the country round about. Plenty of girls knocking around.\n","217":" old thing always cloudy & cold. Some argument in the tent last night, but I kept well out of it – you bet – Must get a bath today.\n\n(Later) Hoo-blooming-ray discovered the bath room & had a bonza shower. Red hot & then icy cold. Gee it was great. Tomorrow the board sits & I’ll hear the verdict. These Frenchies breed beautiful cows, & draught horses. Would like to own a few in Australia like them. Wonder how Harry is getting along up the line or if he has had the bad luck to stop one. (Thus I write from the top of Napoleons Column). For sheer peaceful beauty the scene from this vantage point is absolutely the best yet. The far stretching fields intersected by innumerable hedges & a score of winding ribbon-like roads; the town itself with its fine old Cathedral from whose tower the bells are even now pealing forth; the Harbor from whence\n\nMay 12 rises the smoke of many steamers – intermingling with that of the great factories. Beneath the beautiful grounds surrounding the column, & then the sea, that far famed sea of the North on whose bosom floats our mighty Fleet, the terror of the Hun, but the pride of every Britisher. But naught see I except a few small steamers, tugs & sailing craft. The surface is calm, almost without a ripple & beyond hardly discernable, is the coast of England. One would hardly realise that the world is at war, if it were not for the many tents dotted here & there on the landscape, & the groups of soldiers passing to & fro along the roads. And yet – what hidden dangers may be lurking beneath the calm surface of yon sea, what enemies even in our midst. (words fail utterly to convey any adequate idea of the beauty of the scene, so I guess ill stop)\n","218":" Raining the greater part of the night & still at it. Going before the Board this morning to take the verdict – Later – They’d give a fellow the pip these Doctors. Have got to wait now for a special report from the Doc at No 13 Hospital. Visited the Barbers & was shaved by a lady, not a bad shave either.\n\n14 Parade as usual, but no Church as far as I can make out. Fine & clear. The old S.M. went crook & told me off to fasten up the flaps of the Guard tent. These Tommy N.C.Os are a lot of damned rotters. The grub is improving some; yesterdays dinner was OK & there was rice pudding to finish up on – Mistake re Church. A Y.M.C.A. chap chatted to us for half an hour or so & then I trekked for the Ref Canteen & demolished tea & sandwiches. The Parson spoke fairly well, but he’s young – younger than yours truly – & that’s saying a lot. Put up a score\n\n Sunday\n","219":" on the Bols table. Not bad for a little un. Fairly decent town this Boulogne despite its cobbles & its narrow winding streets Market day in the Square is rather a busy day, war or no war, & of course all the selling is done by women or old men. The G.P.O & the Cathedral are both fine buildings, the former being right down near the Quay; But strange to say it only appears to have one entrance & exit, IE. through a large swing-door. Many of the shop windows are tastefully dressed, but I haven’t noticed any English business places. The one everlasting complaint from our boys is, \"what a rotten climate\" & they are all longing to get back to Sunny Australia, & the free open spaces – And being imprisoned in this Camp for 20 hrs out of the 24 is literally killing us. Why in Egypt we could do what we darned well liked the greater part of \n\n Sunday\n\nMay 14 the day & we were paid our 2\/- a day also. – Rec’d letter from J.

Round 2 sides of the church & some distance from it runs a wide shady walk hemmed in on both sides by stout brick walls. From the top of the outer wall (which is 5 ft thick in one place) one can look out over the city below. Alongside the wharves were scores of fishing boats, (mostly sailors) & several liners & a Hospital ship. On one part of the wharf was a mine about 3 ft in diameter, which had been raked out of the Channel. Trains & trams were everywhere (almost as common as soldiers). Weighed myself 75 Kilos & then had a look inside the Post office.\n\n16 Woke up during the night to the accompaniment of bombs – evidently from enemy aircraft. Am not going before todays board\n","221":" Spose a fellow will get away some day.

Gee its lovely up here above the crowd & the City. Heard a whisper that im booked for Eng.\n\n17 Paraded down to C.M.I.R. this morning for what I don’t know. Evidently the Heads like to muck a fellow about as much as possible Rather heavy fog, so the day should be fine – Here I am again at No. 13 Stationary waiting for the Doc to turn up. Must word him & see what can be done. – Later – Met the Doc & he straightaway sent me to Hospital again & marked me for England. Guess my luck has turned at last, he’s some Doctor too & you bet I’m jolly pleased to be back again in the same Ward. Some of the boys are still here.\n","222":" Went to short sing song & service (C of E) & rather enjoyed it.\n\n18 Had a chat to Sister last night & then straightaway slept until the Orderly woke me at 5 am & wanted to wash me. Guess I can do that little job myself. \n\nWent for a little stroll to the head of the lane – The Channel lay- shrouded in a thick fog blanket, through which issued at odd intervals the roar of a fog horn from an incoming liner. The sail of a fishing smack, the Pier-head & a few scattered rocks close inshore were dimly discernible. – \n\nThe night orderly looked rather hard at his slippers this morning, because don’t you see, I pinched them last night. Going to England tomorrow, so hope the sun keeps shining. Today has been glorious. A waterplane just slipped in from the Channel, dipped lightly into the water & thence into the Harbor. They’ll be having aerial submarines soon.\n","223":" Leaving for Eng this morning. An Australian Sister whom I had known in Luna Park Hosp. came in to see me this morning. Am marked for the 2nd London Genl Hosp, St Marks Chelsea – per the St George, Southampton.\n\nTakes us about 9 hours to do the trip to England. Sailed at 12 noon. Lovely day, & the sea is calm – no end. Nearly all Tommies in this ward (E) \n\nSomehow I always seem to strike Ward E wherever I go. She’s pretty slick this boat, 17 to 20 or more I reckon. Jolly nice Sister in this ward, good beds.\n\nChoc’s & plenty of reading matter. Passed the Isle of Wight – on our left – (& a nifty little Isle it is too) & are now heading for Southampton. The County is pretty & beautifully green – but low. You should have seen how we zig-zagged coming in to dodge our own mines & Torpedo Nets. Must write Uncle & Harry tonight or tomorrow. Anchored here for the \n","224":" night just off Southampton. Cigs dished out after tea,\n\n20 Glorious morning. One or two tramps passing along the fairway. On our Right is dear old England & on the left the beautiful Isle of Wight its foreshores literally covered with trees out of which peep a few fine old buildings or mayhap even an ancient Castle. \n\nLeft the boat about 9.30 waited on the platform for over half an hour & then entrained. We are now waiting just outside Southampton – what for I don’t know. – Just finished a bowl of tea some bread & jam & a cig! There are several women carriage cleaners outside yarning to the boys, mostly middle aged & grey haired women. \n\n(3rd London Genl Hosp Wandsworth SW) Arrived here per motor from Waterloo Station about 3.40 had Cocoa, a hot bath, & then tea. Am in Ward D3, & there are some of our boys here.\n\n London\n","225":" Jolly good open air Concert in the grounds. Rather a decent Hosp this, & the grounds are A1, & of course the Nurses. You bet.\n","226":" And at 2 am today the clocks were put forward one hour & this morning we got up an hour earlier. Lord is it any wonder that I felt sleepy. Gee! Last night at 8 oclock was real daylight (or twilight) & 8 is our bedtime, so whats it going to be tonight. The sun will be shining im thinking.\n\nFeeling A1 after a shave & a brush up. Went to Church (Non Con) & meanwhile the Sister was looking all over the place for me. Big crowd of visitors in today. Rather warm in the Sun. Struck a couple of our chaps & we were yarning together when a lady took our photo & promised to send the result along later. Not a bad Hosp, no men orderlies & good nurses. In fact its better than being in France.\n\n Sunday\n","227":" Another Roo came into the ward last night suffering from eye & ear troubles. This morning we had to undress again & go to bed, just for the Quack to make a cursory groin inspection. Dinkum, it’s a prison this joint, although otherwise we are treated alright. Gee i’d love to be back in sunny NSW. Just been to the Aust Store & drew tooth paste, razor etc, jolly handy little place it is. Aunty (Mrs Firth) Mary & Phyllis came along this afternoon & we had a long chat. Rather like them all, & hope to see Uncle later on. Was surprised to see 2 girls because I had forgotten all about Phyl (The Child) Seemed funny too calling Mrs F \"Aunt\", but spose ill get over that.\n\n23 Turned out about 5.30 (:- 6.30 new time). There are a couple of ladders near\n","228":" the boundary wall so I perched on top of one & got a good view of the Street opposite. Nothing much doing though – a couple of veterans levelling the grass, a milk cart or two, & sundry John Hops & civvys. Dinky weather though. \n\nWomen carriage cleaners get 2\/8 a day the same as those in Hosp, Gangers 4\/8, Telegraph Messengers 7\/- a week with 1\/- rise every year, the latter have pretty good uniforms & black caps.\n\nAccidentally burnt Auntys address so had to wire to Uncle Jim for it in order to post a couple of Hospital passes. Just yarned to a couple of girls over the wall & made an appt’ for tomorrow afternoon. Oh wretched soldiers! Am afraid though I’m out of it as Uncle will no doubt be coming tm’w. \n\nGood Concert tonight - in the Rec Room. The specialist (a Qld’er) said I could have a glass eye so expect I wont be here long. M\n","229":" Up late as usual. Visiting day today, & the weather is tip top.\n\nWas perched up on the barbed wire fence t’other night yarning to the people outside & listening to the band when a Tommy Officer ordered me down. \n\nAm afraid I hastened slowly, but then Tommy officers are enough to give a fellow the pip. Aunt & another lady came to see me this afternoon & brought sundry bunches of flowers which the Matron straightaway took possession off. We sat on the Lawn in a nice shady spot & yarned for an hour or so until the whistle sounded Rec’d letters from Ethel & Uncle Jim. (Mill)\n\n25 Rather cool with a little wind & rain. 2 more letters from Sue &\n\nUncle Jim. Did a bit of brass & floor polishing & feel better for the exercise. Just been watching the LSWR trains rattle past. There are electrics & ordinaries running R, AD\n","230":" every few minutes. Feeling a wee bit tired I lay down on the grass & straightaway went to sleep. Had a real fine game of Croquet this afternoon There were 8 of us all told, & we enjoyed ourselves no end, also played Bobs for a while.\n","231":" The boys pulled my mattress & all off this morning so I slept on the floor for a while. Another game of croquet. Its like old times & Cotswold. \n\nThis afternoon \"The City of London Police Athletic Club\" gave a tip top entertainment this afternoon in the grounds. The Ex Queen of Portugal was present & enjoyed herself as much as the boys. As for me well, - two rather nice girls sat down beside another chap & I & we were (shall I say) in our element. Rec’d 2 letters, one from Ethel contained a Postal Note & I don’t know whether to return it or not.\n\n27 Pulled clean out of \n","232":" bed this morning & deposited on the floor clothes & all & then the bed was upended, so thought it was time to wake up & have a bath. Beautifully cool & clear Going Harefield today or Monday. Am to see Doc this morning. Later saw Doc & expect to leave here next week. Unable visit Auntie Em, so wired them. \n\nMotored out to St Annes Hall where we were well entertained by the Ladies & gents & pupils. The Kiddies dancing was splendid & Miss Maxted singing couldn’t be beat, & the boys clapped & stamped a treat, one little tot – \"6 year old Questa\" - brought the house down with her dancing. Altogether we had a ripping time & returned home just in time to listen to the last 3 items of another Concert.\n\n28 Sleep did you say? I should think we did after the excitement of yesty. Wonder how the boys Sunday\n","233":" at the front are faring. Missed Church, but finished \"Ravenshoe\" one of Kingsleys. Auntie, Uncle, Phyl & Mary came along this afternoon & we \"sprawled\" on the grass for an hour or two – watching the trains & buses whiz by & yarning a treat. Talk about perfect weather – its \ngreat\n! Am leaving for Harefield tomorrow. Didnt know until 5 pm today, so have written Auntie Em. Nearly forgot to mention the fruit flowers, eggs & cigs which they brought me. Met several chaps in the adjacent Wards who were with me in E Ward over at Boulogne, & one of em the Canadian, straightaway apptd me as Sec’y, & gave me 2 letters to write, & then shortly after, one of our own chaps got me on the same gag. They reckon that they cant see to write. We soon polished off the fruit, & one of the boys fastened onto the cigs. \nSunday\n\n29 Leaving for Harefield at 2 pm & am now\n","234":" togged out as a Kitcheners Army man. Oh Lord! These women! & their letters. Have just received three long effusive epistles from Leeds. Ewart my son, I’m afraid you’re in for it; & it’s a pity too, because you hate visiting & kidstakes. And again you’ll have to behave real well – perhaps \"Gods demesne, Australia\" is for \"mine\" always. Just licked a couple of other patients at Croquet; rather a nice, quiet game it is – for one eyed men. Left for Harefield per motor bus at 2 pm. My mate & I were on top & had a glorious view. We passed through some beautiful Country, made a fellow feel happy to be alive & well. Arrived here about 4.30 changed into Hosp suits, saw the Doc, & then had tea. It’s a ripping place & our own nurses too! The village is just close by & the grounds & country round about are beautiful. A fellow can go for a nice\n\n Harefield\n\nMay 29 long ramble too, & although its dead quiet one doesn’t mind that in the least. It’s a relief too to get away from the squabbling of the Tommies & all the red tape.\n","235":" Slept real well after a good shower last night. Pratted my frame through the door & got a job. You bet I handled that mop to some purpose. First came the brush on a long handle then two rubber scrapers – also on long handles & last of all the mop. Each bucket of water was diluted with fenile, & we did the job in no time.\n\nPlayed croquet nearly all the afternoon, but was licked 2 out 3 times. Jolly good games they were too. Slight rain but nothing to speak of. Wrote several letters – incl one for another chap. Everything one wants here, Library, Billiards & Concert Rooms, Canteen Croquet Lawn, Red x store etc.\n\n31 Dodged toil this mng, & went for a bit of a stroll round the grounds\n","236":" The Colonel said I would be able to go back to my job at home, but he didn’t say when! & I don’t want a job on the staff. Went to the Dentist this morning & suffering a few more twinges, he’s not finished yet either by a long way. Played several games of croquet & then went to listen to & watch the Concert which was given by several tip top artists – mostly juveniles, and it was good too – real good & the surroundings perfect. You bet the boys appreciate it all - Being wounded & sick isn’t half bad I can tell you. Our suits (Hospital) are black & look better & feel more comfortable than the blue’s we had at No 3. London.\n","237":" Board sits today I believe, but don’t think I’m for it. Later. Am marked Unfit for Active Service, but fit for light duties & go before the board this afternoon. Hope they don’t give me a job in England. –\n\n\"Been before the Board & the Colonel & I spoke\n\nJune 1 thusly – \"You were unlucky enough to stop one\"? – Yes. \"Alright – you needn’t wait\". Exit me.\n\nTip top Concert tonight. First class singing, reciting & acting, & a slashingly original comic – one of the best ive seen. The party comes down to Harefield every Thursday night.\n","238":" Reveille woke me this morning. The twilight lasts for such a darned long time in this country, that a fellow cant get to sleep. Passed one Board but have to go before another tomorrow mng. Rec’d 9 letters from Aust & 3 from Eng – all addressed to Egypt. Waited round the Office for 2 or 3 hours, & was told to come back – later –\n\n3 Won a game of Croquet; \"for a wonder\" Rather chilly in the shade but good on the Lawn.\n\nWent before the board, but know nil. Also saw the Major re a glass eye. Am to visit him again on Wed & the dentist on Monday.\n","239":" Jolly good Concert after tea, given by a Choir from London. Guess we don’t suffer from lack of entertainment. Also received two letters (1 from Australia)\n","240":" Shall we go to Church? Or! Think I’d better sweep out the Ward & then have a shave. Coot of a day, been raining like the very devil all day. The boys are busy playing cards, stretched out on their beds, or else walking up & down outside the Wards trying to keep warm. My job is letter writing. \n\nSister just collected some cash from the boys & provided us with tea & cakes. Premier Ryan of Qld gave a short address tonight in the Mess Room He speaks well too & the boys, as usual fairly made the rafters shake. \nSunday\n, Ess\n","241":" About 1 am No 17, who has only one leg, let out 3 awful yells which woke himself & everybody else, & then he calmly asked the AMC Sgt for a drink of water\n\nThe Sgt I may say hurried not at all & poor old 17 is being bantered no end this mng. Raining nearly all day, but managed to have a few games on the lawn. Am booked for Australia the Doc says.\n","242":" Received 6 letters from Australia all pretty old though. Finished with the Dentist thank goodness – for a month or two. Eye still discharging a good deal, & my nut aches. Dished em up on the croquet lawn today. Rain nearly all gone.\n","243":" Beautiful day, just like Sept in New South Rec’d 6 more letters – including 3 from Australia Cabled Dad for a fiver. Wonder will he bring it along, because I want to buy a tunic. \n\nRaining like blazes again. Going to London tomorrow to have a glass eye fitted in, but have been refused leave. (Later) Granted 10 days leave & a free pass. R\n\n8 Going London this morning, & as the weather is tip top we\n","244":" should have a nice drive in the car. This Tommy rigout kills me though, its dead rotten. Arrived London (per train) about 11, fixed up things generally at Horseferry, drew £ 4 & purchased a tunic for 45\/- & had dinner at the Anzac Buffet They dish it out for nix too) Met Arthur Kingsbury there. He has been on the sick list & is working now at Horseferry Road as a clerk. The major could not supply me with an eye, so im going to wait until the 17th for one. Had a real nice trip to Bristol where we arrived at 5.50. The Portishead train leaves at 6.20 & I’ve wired Uncle Jim to meet me. Passed through beautiful country but theres not the cultivation one sees in France. The trouble is that the towns are too thickly populated , therefore the country suffers for it. Uncle Jim met me at Portishead Stn, & knew me instantly. Hes just like\n\nJune 8 Dad only for the whiskers. Drove to the Cottage about 3 miles, & discovered Auntie feeding the chooks. It’s a natty little cottage, good big garden, plenty of ducks & fowls & of course heaps of grass. Guess Uncle put in a lot of hard work because the ground is very stony (turned in at 12)\n\n9 Up about 8 after a good night, in fact I didn’t like getting up at all. Ethel wants me to go to Leeds, but I’m nearly broke. Uncle says he’s going to pay my fare but I don’t like the idea. Hope Dad cables that fiver. \"Oh this confounded cash! Went for a long walk with Uncle in & around Portishead. The scenery here is simply glorious ( & of course there are the boats in the Channel. I tell you we walked a devil of a long way too Had a splendid dinner, Auntie is a first class cook alright. After dinner we walked through a lovely valley (about 3\n","245":" miles distant) to the pretty coastal town of Clevedon, with its beautiful coastal scenery. In fact it surpassed anything I have yet seen & English people are justly proud of their little Island, & have no need to go abroad for sight seeing purposes. We had some excellent tea at a nice clean café, for which Uncle paid. (only hope Dad Cables that fiver) & then wandered along the sea front & through lovely tree lined streets. The buildings are mostly of stone & are tile roofed & the majority of them are covered in many places with vines. Dodged the rain fairly well & landed home at 9 oclock\n\n10 Rec’d a wire from Ethel so got £ 2 from Uncle & left for Leeds this mng at 6.50. Uncle came part of the way with me though & saw me safely on the Midland train. Had a good trip, although it was raining at Leeds when we arrived. Met a traveller from Australia on board, & we\n","246":" a good long yarn about N.S.W. & the boys. Arthur met me at the train & we walked to the nearest tram & then home. Ethel is rather jolly & I like her, but I decline to go visiting – (Later) Ethel & I \ndo\n go visiting but the people are really jolly & I enjoyed it no end. Also saw Isabel (in fact we stayed there for tea) but I was rather disappointed in her. \"Such is life – ∧: photographers\". Caught some rain but only a little. After tea Arthur & I strolled through the main part of the City & then trammed back, called at the Liberal Club for an hour or so & from there home. Leeds is far bigger than I thought it was (pop of 400,000) & it isn’t a very dirty City. The tram service is good, & of course they are all double deckers & not single like Sy trams. \n\n11 Up at 7am & went for short stroll & bought a couple of papers & some chocs. After brek we all went to Church & I’m sorry to say! Giggled muchly, but such is life \nSunday\n","247":" He wasn’t a bad poor beggar of a parson but still he could have been better. After Church a middle aged lady nearly fell on my neck & kissed me. Of course I didn’t mind but would have preferred one of the girls. The rain still hangs about. Trammed to the gardens this afternoon, & then walked back. Would like a few days more to have a good look round & as for girls – gee! There are hundreds of them – in fact thousands! Isabel smokes cigs! Good time tonight, 3 lady visitors & 1 gent.\n","248":" Still like rain, must visit the Barber. Arthur & I went for a run through the City. Mr Wilson showed us over the Electrical Show Rooms & it was jolly interesting too. Rain Mafeesh so far. After dinner we went to the famous Old Abbey – (1058) then to the Jewish School for Ethel. The Kiddies were characters too. Had tea & the \n\npicture palace, & then listened to the orchestra & enjoyed the pictures for a couple of hours. After that an evening at Mrs Wilsons & it was tiptop. Landed home at 12.15 feeling tired & sleepy, but happy.\n\n13 Up late of course, about 8.15. Left Leeds for Swindon at 10.55; both Ethel & Arthur were at the Station to see me off. Cold as blazes & like rain. Left Cheltenham at 3 for Swindon. Feeling jolly tired & a bit hungry Uncle Jim met me at Swindon & we strolled down the main Street to Auntie Nances where we had tea with the family Nance is very much like Em, & they are both like Dad. Ike was at Wootton Bassett Station to meet us. I had no idea that Auntie Sue was so small, but she’s jolly nice & I can understand why she got on so well with Mum. Ike looks real well, the single life I guess. What caught my eye was the old town Hall in the \n","249":" centre of the main street (High St) The town itself is quiet & old-world Pop’ about 2,000\n\n14 \nSome\n winter weather this Wonder what Dad would think of it. Sue uses the room in which he was born. Little did I think a couple of years Since that I would ever set eyes on England, let alone come right here. On the way down from Cheltenham I noticed several familiar names which I had often heard at home. On the other hand we passed (on the Bristol line) the town of Tamworth & I felt almost inclined to get out & pay a visit to the Office, but \nthat Office\n is over 12,000 miles away from here. \n\nThe Wesleyan Chapel just opposite is dated 1858, so it must have been built before Dads time. Had a good look round, inspected the C of E & the graveyard. The Church is very old – having been built in 1300 & it has all the latest improvements, \"heaters etc\" Saw Grandmothers & Grandfathers graves –\n","250":" & visited relations to no end. Tonight we were entertained at Kings until nearly midnight. Seems strange seeing all the old spots where Dad played as a boy. Tinkers green is just behind us. The Sexton (aged 50) related tales of long past.\n","251":" Dull & cool but no rain. Visited the old town Hall which stands in the centre of the Street & its interesting too; the ducking stool, the stocks, the old Russian Cannon & several other relics paintings & silhouettes. There is also a fairly good library & pipes for heating purposes run round the sides of the room \n\nLeaving for Portishead this afternoon. Later – Quite a crowd at the Station to see me off. Some swank! What? Just caught the train at Avonmouth after a sharp run. After tea we all went for a walk along the coast past the Nautical School & back It’s a lovely walk too\n\n \n","252":" Up late as usual. Uncle & I strolled down to Portishead, but no luck. Wonder why the Dickens Dad hasn’t sent that fiver? Perhaps its in London at the Com Bank. There are some beautiful views along the coast & to make things better we scored a couple of glasses of good cherry cider. Wish I only had the cash & could stay for a few weeks. All three went for a long walk about 8 oclock & called in at several places enroute\n\n17 Left Auntie at the gate but Uncle came with me to Bristol & saw me safely on board. Weighed in at Portishead Stn (12 St 1) Beautiful weather now, something like a summer Guess Im coming back again to England one of these days! Arrived London about 12.20. Had dinner at the Anzac Buffet. Taxi to Marleybone – which I left at 3.7 for Denham. Bought a few brooches etc in Horseferry Road. Arrived Hosp (per motor) about 4.30, & expect to go to the \n","253":" Transport next Tuesday although I believe one eyed men are now put on Transport duties. Am back in the old ward & feeling good.\n","254":" Jolly good long sleep last night thank you. Had the clothes hoisted off me this mng & a couple of the boys had a pillow fite Going on Tuesday alright & the Doc says I may not get my eye until I reach Australia. Sort of impromptu Concert & dance in the Hall this afternoon & we had rather a good audience too including several girls & a couple of Frenchmen who appeared to be enjoying themselves no end. There was a good pianist on the job too. Am writing this by the side of a shady hedge far from the madding crowd – So far. An Aust from the \"Warspite\" gave an interesting a\/c of the Jutland fight. \nSunday\n\n19 Drawing kit at 1.30 today & leaving here tomorrow. The long wavy grass is like a carpet underfoot & a myriad\n","255":" buttercups & daisies sway gently to & fro in the breeze. From the oaks & beeches which border the Road come the horse cries of the rooks; & thrushes, blackbirds & robins fill the air with song. \n\nMany thoughts flash through my mind as I lie full length on the yielding grass beneath the overspreading branches of a mighty \noak\n. Gnarled & weather beaten he is, like some old veteran, & yet firm as a rock.\n\nBut now the sun lies hidden behind the cloud veil & something of a quiet seems to creep in almost unawares; the wind grows colder & not a few of my feathered friends cease their carolling – and here in this quiet spot I say farewell to England – the dear Homeland, but still my thoughts stray ever to \"Gods Demesne\" Australia! & the loved ones waiting there, and let us breathe a prayer for our gallant boys in the trenches – aye - for those who die suffering silently in the Hospitals.\n\n"}}
