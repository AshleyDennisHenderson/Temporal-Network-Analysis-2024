It is a great pity that when the men here are giving their lives, or if not their lifes 10 or 20 years of it for their country, the politicians or men so called cannot pull together and do their bit by trying to make Australia self contained in regard to munitions. It seems to me the only remedy is to have one house of parliament\n\n72\n\nand put in that house men who have had the training to look ahead and see what is before them. It seems also that Aust. has made an irreparable mistake in attempting to put in the field 5 divisions, the loss of which it can ill afford.\n","223":"\n\nLeft Poperinghe by 6.15 a.m. train changed at Hazebrouck took train at 8.05 a.m for St. Omer.

Myself on an AMC stretcher. Bourke on a sheet of galvanised iron, Helms on a sheet of paper & Rouse on a biscuit tin with a candle inside, slept a little.\n","283":"\n\nWhen awakened this morning had to feel for my legs, they were so cold.

How men can stand it at all is wonderful. Father Clune came back this afternoon very tired. Stan went yesterday to England.

Saw a tank, oval in shape about\n\n91\n\n30 ft long & 10 ft broad with pr of large iron wheels behind for steering, moved by an oil engine along centre inside & which works 2 endless chains around both sides. Chains are fitted with plates which dig into ground & drag it along fitted with 4 m.guns and 2 6pr guns, iron covering of sufficient strength to stop pieces of shells & bullets but not direct hits. Padre was wounded over the eye, not seriously. Bat. relieved by 26th Batt, 17 and 18 going into huts at Mametz & 20th to Carlton Camp.

Middleton going to a school so Dent took over C Company was Batt. was ordered to \n\n92\n\nattack german front & support line at 6.45 am next morning. was looking forward to a lively time when at a meeting of the officers to discuss the operation I was told I would be liason officer to the 149th Bge who were attacking on our left. Rather a surprise when I had made up my mind to go over. must say I was not disappointed to any great extent. Had the same feeling as I had before the 2nd time in at Pozieres that all would be well. I left the Batt at 11.45 pm and proceeded across country. I arrived at Bge H.Q. very tired and wet & 1.15 a.m. and bunked in the mess room.\n\n14\/11\/16\n\nThe artillery opened exactly at 6.45 a.m. and continued to fire heavily for 30’ when our barrage lifted to rear of second objective 300 yds. All communications with Bge at front line was cut by 9 a.m. The Batt. commanders of 5 & 7th Northumberland Fusiliers \n\n93\n\nassumed that all was correct and did not worry with the result that at 2 p.m. there was no information through regarding front line. General Owen co. 149th Bge took me down to the Batt H.Q.’s of 5 & 7th Batt’s to straighten things out the result was that he ordered the Batt. Commanders to make a reconnaissance in force under their personal supervision. This attack which was ordered for 6.30 p.m. did not come off until after mid-night such was the congestion & lack of control in the front line & C.T.’s. When this attack was made it transpired that all the success of \nthe\n early in the day had been retaken by the German probably at 11 a.m. when we knew he had counter attacked but did not know the result. The only part held was a small portion of the gird trench in conjunction with the","288":" A.I.F. Our Batt. gained both \n\n94\n\nobjectives and held on to them despite heavy counter attacks.

Anderson & Somerset & Burke were wounded and Stewart, Dent, Gurr & Helms killed. On returning to Bge H.Q. the General in trying to dodge some shrapnel twisted his ankle and I had to practically carry him for about 800 yds.\n","289":"\n\nArtillery practically ceased firing, reported to Bge & learnt that there were only 5 officers & 85 men left.

Firstly tried to stop the signalling business from behind. The Hun then started to retire in 2s & 3s seeing this I sent out 5 patrols to hurry matters & the first batch that they brought in was 77. the prisoners altogether numbered 150 & 4 officers. 2 german maxims gun & 2 lewis captured by him some time before. In 2 hours from the start all was quiet. I was recommended but dont know how things have got \nup\n on.

Barrage marked by L.H. carrying flares. At zero hour this Batt was the only one ready to move, others very late. 17th caught up on German wire, rather spoil show, moved back to tents & then to trench. later on we moved back to the tents will remain here until stunt.\n","446":"\n\nBeautiful day very comfortable in tents, drilled this morning practice stunt in conjunction with 20th Batt. in the afternoon. Rec. parcel from Alice.\n","447":"\n\nSunday went to church in morning. ","448":" Bge band played us home through Favreuil. Band played all the afternoon in camp. Summer weather.\n","449":"\n\nDid another practice 2 Bges. Zero hour 4 a.m. went off all right, have orders to be ready to move forward\n\n141\n\nit looks like the real thing. Such a beautiful day, did not go to sleep, rec. orders at 10.0 p.m. to move to Noreuil.\n","450":"\n\nLeft camp at 12.0 midnight and arrived at Noreuil 3.30 a.m. relieved 7th Bge, very tired, had a sleep remained there all that day, drew bombs etc.\n","451":"\n\nAnother fine day went up to have look at Reincourt. a German aeroplane brought down by m.gun fire. \n","452":"\n\nSpent day in getting final instructions and issuing colours, bombs etc. Davies, Avard , Mason and myself lay down for a few hours before we moved off all were in the best of spirits.\n","453":"\n\nBatt moved off at 12.30 a.m. \nA,B\n B.A. D.C. few shells fell near on way to jumping off tapes.\n\n142\n\nEverything fixed up by 3.30 a.m. Zero hour 3.45 a.m. The barrage started on left towards Bullecourt first and then our own started. The front lines were slow to move, they could be distinctly seen owing to the flashes of the shells. The Hun m.guns and barrage started at the same time. The waves in front of me lost direction and moved too much to the right and the rear lines 20th Batt moved faster than our line, and on the right of the Reincourt had passed right through them. The lines up to the wire were fairly good it was reached at 3.50 a.m. leaves 2 minutes to go before the barrage lifted off O.G.I. this necessitated \n\n143\n\na halt when the 2 first waves were in the wire and this halt proved our undoing. The m.gun fire of the hun was terrific and the men who were in groups of 2 and 3’s did not move forward as a whole when the time was up. On the contrary an order seems to have been given by an officer (unknown) to pull out. The result being that the men who were practically without officers or N.C.O.’s retired. I continued and pulled up in a C.T. joining the Hindenburg line with 30 men. There were with me Lt. Hinds and Lt. Kant, who was afterwards killed. We made a block with sand-bags & wire near the Hun mail line & prepared to stay all day.\n\n144\n\nAs soon as the Hun found where we were he started to bomb but was beaten off. the men \nwere very\n with a few exceptions displayed no spirit at all even when the hun got within a few yards of them they had no intention of fighting, there only thoughts were how to get out. Had at one time made an attempt to show a white flag. We successfully held on all day losing men both from our own and Fritz artillery. At night fall, seeing that the bombing on our left did not advance near enough for us to effect a junction, we decided to withdraw so at 9.30 p.m. under very heavy m.gun fire the wounded were sent under good men out of \n\n145\n\nto the rear end of the trench. By 10.30 only 6 of us were left 2 of these I sent away and at 11.0 p.m. moved off with the last party. At the end of the trench we found a man with a broken thigh. Sgt Carter of the 17th Batt myself and 2 others started to get him out. The first man to leave the trench got shot in the arm. Carter bandaged him & sent him away. The wounded man was now shoved over the parapet and dragged forwards a few yards by Carter. I next moved out and found that to move him any further he had to be lifted over the back wire, so getting a good hold we tried our luck. 3 m.guns where immediately \n\n146\n\non to us and though sparks flew out of the wire in all directions we managed to reach a shell hole a few yards away clear of the wire. From here on with the aid of the other man we managed to \nget\n make progress by means of short stages, shell hole to shell hole until we reached the Reincourt Rd where we were too far away for the m.guns to do accurate shooting. ½ way to the railway cutting we found a stretcher and completed the journey in comfort. I arrived at \nthe\n H.Q. at 3.0 a.m. had sleep & then moved to Vaulx where the Batt spent the day. The officers lost men killed Davies, Avard.\n\n147\n\nMason, Kirkwood, Kant missing Breckenridge and Fitzgerald wounded Blumer, Townson, McMeckin, Foster.\n","454":"\n\nAt 12.30 p.m. rec. orders to move to a camp (tented) near Biefvillers.
