Called at British Embassy where an Irish Guards Captain was very kind, prepared documents, sent me to British Consulate General and Prefecture of police with the result that Passport now only requires Visa from Swiss Legation to complete. Called at American HQrs re Sports on 22nd. Dined at Hotel and with Denning later attended a performance of \"Figaro\" at Opera Comique. \n\nMileage 78 miles\n","168":"\n\nLeft Hotel at 10.30 am for Swiss Legation. Finally completed Passports for Chauffer and self. Afterwards called on American General Commanding troops in Paris. Then spent half an hour in the Bois de Boulogne. A very bright scene especially on Sunday mornings. Lunched at Hotel Scribe and at 1pm left for Pershing Stadium to represent Australia at opening Ceremony. A splendidly designed and constructed reinforced structure capable of seating 22000 persons. Troops made a splendid show in opening display especially the French Regiments with their tattered colours. Then arrived President & Mme. Poincaire with Gen Pershing and party. President Wilson, Clemencau, and other notables not present. (Have heard a rumour that the Germans have sunk their fleet at Scapa – perhaps this has necessitated an Allied Conference)\n\nFollowing inspection of the troops by the President, the allied athletic teams made their appearance. A splendid body of men representative of the Allied Armies. The Australians were led by Capt Caphill of my old 9th Brigade. The day was a huge success and reflect the greatest credit on the American army. The sports on succeeding days will be well worth seeing. Col Watson & Capt Savage managing for Australia.\n\nLeft Stadium at 5pm for Epernay via La Ferte and Chateau Thierry. We had a \"blowout\" of near rear tyre after passing La Ferte luckily pulling up under the shadow of a wayside cherry tree carrying plenty of fruit above the level at which small boys could reach.\n\nWe succeeded in getting all we needed. Had an excellent dinner\n\nat Chateau Thierry. Reached Epernay at 10pm. Arranged rooms at Hotel Europe, now being inundated with American tourists who are out to see the local American Battle fields. I am informed that Mr Lloyd George has stayed at the Hotel on three different occasions.\n\nThe valley of the Marne is very beautiful, and the journey from La Ferte to Epernay was particularly enjoyable. We make early start tomorrow for Rheims. Milage 96 miles.\n","169":"\n\nLeft Epernay 6.30 am for Treves via Rheims. Rethel –Mezeires – Sedan, Verdun, Briey and Luxembourg.\n\nRheims rather surprises me. From descriptions I had read I expected a city absolutely flattened like Ypres, Ballieul and Albert. Not so, however. Tho' much damage has been done, many buildings will readily admit of restoration, and this particularly applies to the Cathedral, the stonework of which is only about 25 &percent damaged. Fire has however absolutely destroyed the roof. Breakfasted at Continental Hotel, then journeyed on. From the high ground to the North East of the town one gets a splendid view of the City and the surrounding country including the ridge to the Westward, and one spontaneously admires the tenacity of the French troops in denying this city and the splendid ridge to the Southward to the enemy. \n\nThe battlefields show little signs of shelling, but nature has also been kind and the ground is now covered with luxuriant grass growth, filled with scarlet poppies, blue cornflowers and purple thistle, a perfect blaze of colour.\n\nSedan of 1870 fame has little of the old relics left. Verdun I have always wished to see, and here certainly are the unmistakable signs of heavy and continuous battle. The ground outside the town is pitted very liberally with shell holes, and Forts Vaux & in particular have been well strafed, while the town proper is really a ruin. Lunched at an improvised restaurant at the Railway Station. Here also my previous remarks re poppies at Rheims held good. Journeying eastward one gets a magnificent panorama of the surrounding country from the ridge 1½ miles out of the town, and one appreciates the heroic defence of Verdun by the French – at bitter cost – but successfully.\n\nWe had not time to visit to the fulll just to the Southward – especially American soil - \n\n \n\nBriey noted for its iron mines is very interesting. Works are scattered along the roadside well towards Luxembourg.\n\nLuxembourg is intensely interesting and picturesque and occupies as prominent a place in history as it does in the Duchy of Luxembourg. \n\nWe stay tonight at Treves, also a very ancient and interesting town.\n\nNow we are in Germany proper, and hear German spoken on all sides. \n\nBy the Courtesy of the HQrs American Army, we are staying at the Hotel Porta Nigra, and very comfortable we are too.\n\nGenerally the journey today has been exceedingly interesting and the scenery very fine. The Roads are very bad generally - flanked in the main by fruit trees, cherries being in full bearing. Before reaching Verdun we passed many small obelisks erected by the 5th American Division to commemorate incidents in their advance. What if the Australians were to do likewise???\n\nEpernay and Rheims noted for their Champagnes are in the midst of vines – the hill sides full of them. The Valley of the Moselle between Luxembourg and Treves is indeed charming. Here again vines are everywhere in abundance. Mileage 235 miles. \n\n","170":"\n\nLeft Treves at 6.30 am and journeyed to Strasbourg, Saarburg,and Thionville – Metz and Chateau Salino. From Treves to Saarburg one gets splendid views of the Saar river and Valley. Here also plenty of vines. On the way to to Thionville one gets splendid views of the Moselle. Thionville itself noted for its blast furnaces and steel works – Included in the 1870 Battlefields. Here we breakfasted. Many signs of British bombing. From Thionville to Metz also splendid views of the Moselle Valley. Metz very interesting, and on its eastern face hundreds of crosses mark the graves of 1870 warriors. Metz Cathedral is very fine. From Metz to Strasbourg we travelled practically along the old French frontier, and here we saw strong points heavily wired which had been constructed by the Boche. Now being demolished by farmers. Arrived Strasbourg 3pm. Called on Military Governor. Arranged for petrol for Swiss trip. Room secured for me at Hotel de la Ville de Paris, very comfortable if expensive.\n\nGreat peace celebrations tonight. The town has gone mad. In the main square by 8pm a huge crowd congregated. Here there was to be an assembly of troops and afterwards a \n\nMarch through the City. About 8.30 two Squadrons of cavalry arrived one in blue and the other in Khaki uniform. After much trouble they succeeded in themselves getting into the square, but it was another matter for them to press back the crowds sufficiently to admit of the troops and bands forming up. There was however very good tempered and by 9pm a square had been cleared and massed bands of and Jouaves assembled, also drummers and trumpeters.\n\nThe Military Governor arrived about this time and I joined him. Then the guns boomed out a salute after which the massed bands band played the \"Marseillaise\" the people frantically cheering at its conclusion. Then followed an inspiring roll of drums and fanfare. The square was brilliantly illuminated with arc lamps and projectors placed in the top floors of surrounding buildings, while Infantry carried hundreds of flares. The troops headed by the Cavalry at about 9.30 commenced a circuit of the City followed by thousands of the populace. Gradually the procession broke up into three parties, each with its admiring followers and each taking different routes, occasionally crossing or attempting to cross each other. The Military party first, then the City Band with its admirers, then a big crowd of apparent students.\n\nAt midnight the show was still in full swing and I am especially pleased to have seen this historic city (where the Marseillaise was first sung) in such a mood. Church and other bells are ringing everywhere and bunting is lavishly displayed. \n\nThis afternoon inspected the Cathedral with its famous clock, also many parts of the town. About half retains its old time interest, the balance is modern German.\n\nRoadsides everywhere today lined with fruit trees, cherries, pears, apples and walnuts – the latter particularly very fine.\n\nMileage 172 miles.\n","171":"\n\nLeft Strasbourg at 6.15 am for Constance vie Neuf Brisach, Bale and Winterthur. Breakfast at Neuf Brisach and then discovered I had left my money in my uniform jacket. I had changed into mufti for this trip. Sparks my chauffeur came to the rescue and thus avoided the necessity of going back to Strasbourg. Crossed into Switzerland just north of Bale – or Basle. First the French examined my papers and passed me without delay, \n\nbut with the Swiss Authorities the matter was quite different. Passports examined, car weighed and sealed, account for 880 franks charged as deposit for return of car. Rather a - leaving us very short for expenses. Sparks again to the rescue. Luckily yesterday we had bought refreshments of all kinds in Strasbourg and packed a hamper for the journey. Lt Denning not with us, he left for London today from Strasbourg via British Army of occupation to sit for a Diplomatic Service exam. After an hour's delay passed frontier. Arrived Constance about 6pm and reconnoitred the town as far as German Sentries would permit. Lunched near al Fresco. The scenery very beautiful, the Rhine valley here is indeed a beautiful strip of country.\n\nFrom Strasbourg to Bale very fertile, beyond very hilly and scenery magnificent. Discovered 2 leaves broken in near front wheel spring. Effected temporary repairs at lunch time.\n\nConstance beautifully situated on the edge of the lake. Sorry not sufficient time or opportunity to explore thoroughly. Stayed at Hotel Barndorf Constance. Mileage 178 miles.\n","172":"\n\nLeft Constance at 6 am. Miserable drizzling rain. Passed through Zurich, Lucerne, Interlaken, Saanen & Bulle where we stayed for the night at Hotel de P. Union. Very comfortable. Journey today entrancingly beautiful. Zurich a charming town charmingly situated, but pales into the background beside Lucerne which is absolutely delightful. Buildings a fine type - streets scrupulously clean.\n\nJourney from Lucerne onward to Bulle specially interesting. The rain and mist spoilt many of the best views.\n\nBreakfasted just before entering Zurich lunched on roadside overlooking Lac de Sarnen. Crossing of the Brunig Col especially beautiful. Ran into a heavy snow storm – imagine in mid summer and later on at ran into a second and much more severe one. View of mountains at Interlaken rather obscured but we saw sufficient to get a fair idea of the scenery generally. Jung Frau standing up majestically. \n\nWe had intended to go on to Geneva via the Southern side of the lake, but because of Customs troubles at the French frontier decided to take another road from Saanen and branched\n\n \n\nWestward and Northward along a most beautiful ravine – (Sarine river). I have decided to cut out visiting the actual town of Geneve, and will tomorrow go direct northward from Lausanne. I should love to spend a month here. \n\nPurchased photos of the chief towns through which we passed. \n\nMileage 199 miles\n","173":"\n\nThe morning broke quite clear and though a few showers fell, generally the day has been fine.\n\nLeft Bulle at 6 am for Neuf Brisach via Lausanne, - Fryborg – Berne – Langenthal and Bale. Again scenery especially good, particularly when dropping down to Vevey and along the shores of Lake Geneva. Hill sides covered with vines, and snow clad mountains dominating the lake. Breakfast a Moulton. Friborg very pretty, everybody gay, wearing small flaps in honour of peace. Fine suspension bridge over gorge. Arrived Berne at midday. Called on British Consul, and Brig Gen Russell at Legation, he being military attaché. Very interesting country throughout and intensely cultivated. An abundance of Cherry & Walnut trees. Farming are in many cases manuring their grass paddocks after reaping, with liquid manure. Cashed cheque at Berne. \n\nArrived at Neuf Brisach at 8pm after a journey covering 197 miles. Much heavy hill climbing but not a puncture and no car trouble. Had to buy 5 gallons of petrol at Bale. No difficulties in crossing the border. Total mileage for Swiss trip from Strasbourg to return to the same town tomorrow morning 619 miles.\n\nSpecial features noted on Swiss trip :- Country appears wonderfully prosperous, and fully cultivated. Buildings substantial in towns, and in villages and hamlets of wood typical and substantial design. Towns wonderfully clean. Speaking well for municipal government. Many new buildings just finished and in course of erection. Magnificent scenery – beautiful flower gardens, and window boxes.\n","174":"\n\nLeft Neuf Brisach at 7.30 am for Mayenne via Strasbourg – Lautebourg – Spina – Manneheim – Worms and Oppenheim.

Current rate of exchange 1 pound sterling = 39 francs. \n","302":"\n\nQuite comfortable night even without sleeper. Arrived at Aix le Bain about 9 am and reached Modana about noon. The last 20 miles to Modane very beautiful mountain country, covered in snow. Took a few snapshots. R.T.O. at Modana took us in hand and provided movement orders for Rome. Lunched at station, changed money and bought some postcards. Continued journey at 2.30pm. Shortly after leaving Modana the train traverses a seven mile tunnel (15 minutes run). On the Station side the scenery very beautiful. Mountain peaks covered with snow and all varities of foliage from brilliant Autumn tints to the dark green of the pines. Reached Turin after dark and continued journey to Genoa. Purchased cards at both Turin and Genoa, narrowly missing the train at the latter station. Arrived at Genoa at 10pm and left 20 minutes later for Rome via Pisa. Italian railway carriages not quite so comfortable as the French.\n","303":"\n\nArrived Rome about 10 am. I had previously been informed there were to be special peace celebrations today, but they had been cancelled. Took rooms at Grand Hotel. Called on British Military Attache, Lt Col Rocke, who is tomorrow to obtain necessary authority for our journey to the Italian Front. Lunched at Hotel. In afternoon walked to st Peters Cathedral, taking photos of Hadrians tomb and bridge en route also two views of the Cathedral. Rather disappointed with st Peters in comparison with st Pauls, London.

He has placed his Italian liaison officer (Lieut Magistrati) at my disposal. Today he has lunched with us at our hotel.\n\nThe Italian Minister of War has placed a car at our disposal, and this afternoon we visited the Coliseum, Arch of Constantine, Forum etc. and adjoining places of interest. Took a few photos. Architecture intensely interesting. Later called at Roumanian Legation, Foreign office, British Embassy and British Consulate.\n\nRail journey arranged to Verona, train leaving Rome tomorrow night. This time sleepers are available. Col Rocke has arranged tennis match for tomorrow between Sabatini the Italian Champion and O'Hara Wood. Play to commence at 2.30pm. The British Ambassador, Sir George Buchanan will attend. It has been arranged that tomorrow at 10 am I call a General Diaz the Italian Commander in Chief, and at 10.30 on British Ambassador. Very fine weather so far.\n\nInteresting talk with Military Attache re effect of Italy's neutrality at Commencement of war, making it possible for France to move two Army corps from the French – Italian Frontier. These Corps really saved the situation at the battle of the Marne. Understand that relations between Italy and England at the moment are not of the happiest, owing partly to the Fiume episode, and partly to the believed lack of support of Italy's demands against America demands.\n\nThis morning we walked down the main business street and made purchases of post cards and photographs. Italian officer accompanied us around the old Roman buildings. Could easily spend a month in this city viewing its wealth of Architectural and Art treasures. \n\nArrangements are being made for me to receive from the Commando Supremo a set of 100 typical Italian Army photos, illustrative of their various battle fronts. The British Military Attache is very kindly helping us all he can tho' I fear he will not be able to arrange an audience with the Italian King owing to His Majesty's absence from Rome. He is at present near Pisa, while I hear the Queen of Roumania is at the moment at Florence.\n\nItalian rate of exchange 1 pound sterling = 58 lire.\n","305":"\n\nWith Col Rocke called on General Diaz, the Italian Commander in Chief. He was delighted with his reception in England, during his recent visit and had a most interesting talk with me concerning the future of Italy and England. Both he said are Maritime Nations, and he hoped that Italy and England would ever remain close friends and allies. The problems of war said he were as nothing as compared with the problems of peace. Later called on Sir George Buchanan, the British Ambassador in Rome and our late Ambassador in Russia, in which country he has lost his home and all its contents. Had a most interesting and instructive conversation with him concerning the future of Russia.\n\nArranged sleeping berths for tonight.\n\nAfter lunch attended Army Equestrian sports, and here met the Minister of War, Lieut General Albricci who commanded a corps in France in 1918 and was associated with Gen Godley. Also met Gen Johnston the American Military Attache who earlier had commanded an American Division on the Western Front. Called on the Roumanian Minister, and had Passport Visad by the British Consul.\n\nLeft Rome at 8.50pm for Verona, accompanied by Lt Magistrati, who is to go with us around the Italian front. He speaks English modestly well.\n","306":"\n\nIn early morning passed through Florence and Bologna, reaching Padua about 9.30 AM, a half hour late. The town was, during the latter phases of Italian fighting, the HQrs of the Commando Supremo and also of General . Walked round this interesting old town and inspected the two principal churches. Much arcading along the streets. Had breakfast at an old historical Café named \"Pedrocchi\". Lunched at Hotel Stella B'Oro and caught train at 1.21pm for Verona, which we reached via Vicenza at about 3.40.\n\nAt once made our way to HQrs of Army Corps stationed here. Met Chief of Staff who had received intimation of our visit from War office in Rome. He has placed a car and Col Varizetti at our disposal and we leave tomorrow at 7 am to see the Trentum, Asiago and Piave fronts, later visiting Udine, Gorizia and Trieste.\n\nCol Varizezzi this evening showed us round Verona. Full of interest. Here is a miniature Colliseum in an excellent state of preservation. Enemy bombing both here and Padua caused many casualties. \n\nWe are staying at Hotel Milano and are quite comfortable. The Corps Commander stationed here, whom I met, is Lt General Rias–Armain, and his Chief of Staff Brig General Cornars\n","307":"\n\nPunctually at 7 am a fine Fiat Landaulette car, capable of seating six arrived at the Hotel with the Colonel. At once put baggage aboard and moved off, via Riva and Trento to Bassano. The Col halted at and showed us the position of original line of forts, Austrian and Italian. Mt and Mt Altisimo. Inaccessible and exceedingly difficult country. Our route lay along the valley of the which we crossed at and went on to Riva on Lake Garda. Beautiful scenery en route. The Col showed us Mt where Italians so often unsuccessfully attacked, suffering enormous losses. Here some 13 brigades were decimated in the attempt to scale the mountain, but never did the Italian troops succeed in gaining more than a foothold at the base of the mountain in the vicinity of the village church. Here stones were freely used by the Austrians to hurl down on the Italians below while endeavouring to scale the cliffs. Lake Garda and the town of Riva very beautiful. The town has been a good deal damaged by Artillery fire. Austrian forts and posts in many places in the mountains guarding narrow defiles and approaches. Took a number of photos at lake Riva. Reached Trento at noon. Called on Zone Commander Lt Gen Ghersi and also saw his Chief of Staff Brig Gen Inigone. Lunched with them and their officers. Left Trento at 2pm for Bassano, but owing to heavy falls of snow had to skirt the Asiago plateau instead of crossing it as we had intended. Mountain scenery very grand indeed and roads marvellous. Many are new Military roads designed and executed under Italian Engineers, and they have indeed much to be proud of. At Val in particular there is a magnificent example of a zig zag road of easy grade having been cut practically on a perpendicular face of mountain. Indeed it gave one rather an uncanny feeling to drive down it. Reached Bassano at 6.30pm and engaged rooms at Hotel Mondo.\n\nAutumn tints everywhere gorgeous, and people most industrious. Many fruit trees and vines. Trees in rows about 30 yards apart with grape vines trained along each row of trees. Orchards well kept.\n","308":"\n\nLeft Bassano for Venice via Montello Plateau – Piave River – Trevise – Maestre. Commenced journey at 8.30 am. Montello very interesting. A steep climb up to the plateau up a rather bad road and owing to greasy surface of roadway due to light rain, we had great difficulty in getting the car to the top – everybody pushing including a local peasant, whose wife and 10 small children looked on with much interest and amusement. A great deal of roadmaking has been carried out here by the Italian Army. On the plateau hard fighting has taken place- at one period for a month continuously. Pass also very interesting. Bridges only temporarily repaired. One can imagine what a terrible obstacle this river becomes in the rainy season – a rapid and turbulent stream. Lunched by river and went down eastern bank recrossing again at and passing through Trevise reached Maestre about 4.30pm. Motored through Guiliano where at 5pm we took ferry for Venice, reaching the Grand Canal in about 20 minutes. Changed to a second ferry and traversed the Grand Canal to its end. Took rooms at Royal Daniele Hotel where we are very comfortable. Dined at hotel. Our Italian Colonel guide left us and is staying with an Aunt near by. After dinner we roamed round the Piazza of st Mark and environs. Most shops closed. Beautiful moonlight night. Very fine effect on S Marks Square\n\nMonday 10th November\n\nRather foggy in early morning. At 8.30 took gondola down Grand Canal to railway station and returned by a short route along devious narrow canals. At 10 am met Col Vangetti and with him visited st Mark's. Beautiful internal mosaics. History of fall of Man in the Garden of Eden depicted in Mosaic. Took several photos.\n\nBronze horses removed during the war are now being replaced and the necessary scaffolding is all in position. Saw \"main\" business street , bought some nice views of Venice buildings (which are being sent for me direct to Australia) stamps for Chris and a bronze model gondola. Sun now shining a little through the fog. Lunched at Hotel at noon. At 12.30 took gondola for station and caught 1.30pm train for Maestre. Our chauffeur and car here awaited us. Commenced journey at 2.30 for Udine again crossing the Piave at the spot where we crossed on 9th inst. Later in afternoon crossed the River Tagliamento at this point approximately wide. The bridge has been thrice destroyed and is now in process of reconstruction. Solid stone piers & arches. \n\nArrived at Udine at 6.30pm. Reported to HQrs 8th Army and arranged tour for tomorrow which will finish at Trieste. Guides will be provided for us at Gorizia. Stayed at Hotel Cross of Malta where rooms had been kindly provided by 8th Army. Not yet quite in running order. Dined at Restaurant Nazionale. General Badoglio commanding","309":" Army is at present away from Udine but his Chief of Staff treated us very kindly and did everything possible for us.\n","310":"\n\nBreakfasted early and with Col Vangetti strolled round the town Square and looked at the Castle sited on magnificent high land. Col Vangetti now leaving us and returning to his HQrs at Verona. Said goodbye to him at 8 am. He has been a splendid guide for the knows the battle fronts intimately and is in addition a companion full of wit and humour. A beautiful morning and the magnificent snow clad alps to the northward were particularly impressive. Crossed River Natasori the Italian and Austrian Frontier prior to the war, and here took photos. Just before entering Gorizia we crossed the , here a fine stream. Bridges had all been destroyed by the Austrians in their last big retreat but temporary bridges are in use. Here also took photos. On entering the town we were reminded that today is the anniversary of the signing of the Armistice Agreement. Buildings gaily decorated with Italian National Flags and parade of troops Marching off to sports. Called on General Paolina commanding the Zone. He detailed a Brig General to conduct us along the Isonzo Valley beyond Canale. This was a most enjoyable excursion. Our guide who had commanded a Brigade during the fighting in this sector and his description from the time we entered the ruined village of Saleaus where the two dominant mountains held by the Austrians stand up so prominently (Mt Sabatini and Mt Gabriel) till the end of our journey beyond Canale were intensely interesting. In particular the crossing of the Isonzo in 7 different places during the earlier Italian offensives was a noteworthy performance. Here to engineering difficulties tho' gigantic have been successfully overcome. Took some photos along this Isonzo valley or really gorge – returning to Gorizia about noon. The General then was replaced by a staff major who knew the Carso front, and after lunch on the roadside we continued our journey. The Carso country is quite unlike any country I have fought in or seen. Stone everywhere – Digging of trenches quite \n\nimpossible. In consequence battle lines are a series of breastworks and I am informed the effect of heavy shells in this country is really terrible. Numberless depressions are to be found in this area – natural – about 100 feet across and 30 feet deep. These have generally been used for Battalion and other HQrs . Arrived at Trieste at 4.30pm. Ascertained train leaves for Vienna at 1.15 tomorrow am. so we have decided to go on. Called on General commanding Trieste Zone. Obtained movement order from British RTO. Dined at Savoy (late Excelsior) Hotel.\n\nTrieste a very fine seaport town with excellent modern stone buildings. From the roadway along which we entered Trieste a magnificent view of the town is obtained. Roadway steep to level of town.\n\nTrieste brilliantly illuminated and bands playing tho' rain about 9.30pm rather dampened the ardour of the inhabitants. \n","311":"\n\nLeft Trieste at 1.15 am for Vienna via Udine. On arrival at the Austrian border town (Tarvisio) we were informed no connecting train would run to Vienna till Friday or Saturday, owing to shortage of coal and strike trouble. Passengers had therefore to go on to next station (Villach) by a train leaving in afternoon, or return to Italy by a train leaving Tarvisio at about 6pm. This rather nonplussed us and upset our programme generally. However we interviewed the Lt Col commanding the Sector (Italian) who promptly invited us to lunch (we had already had a mediocre breakfast at the Railway restaurant) and providing a car sent us down to Udine a 2 ½ hours very interesting run down mountain gorges where many traces still remain of fighting between Italy and Austria. Arrived at Udine about 5pm the latter part of the journey being wet and cold. Snow everywhere. GHQ at Udine rang up Trieste and arranged that we should be met at the train with a car on arrival. Left Udine at 8pm by train for Trieste arriving about midnight. Officer with car met us and took us to room at Savoy Hotel as guests of the zone commander. Much snow on mountains, very pretty run by train up valley of Tagliamento and Gill rivers. Tomorrow we May possibly visit Fiume.\n","312":"\n\nBreakfast in Hotel Café. Car arrived for us at 9 am. Saw R.T.O. and arranged our new routes direct to Belgrade and Bucharest, for we now shall not have time to visit Vienna and Budapesth. Called on G.O.C. Zone. Political and transport difficulties in the way of \n\nour seeing Fiume in the time at our disposal so abandoned the idea. Looked round Trieste in morning and took a few photos. Lunched at Hotel, wrote letters in early afternoon, later had a sleep somewhat making up the shortage of the two previous nights. Dined at hotel. Arrived at station at 11pm and occupied a Coupe Compartment. Belgrade train awaits arrival of Paris express, which now regularly runs some hours late, so we slept during the hours of waiting.\n","313":"\n\nTrain actually moved out at 4.30 am. We have the Coupe Compartment to ourselves. Very interesting journey thro' snow clad mountains to Laibach and later along the River Sava to . Here at 2pm a refreshment car was added to the train and we lunched. While waiting at this station a gentleman in plain clothes came to us and asked us if we would take some letters for him to the British Consul at Belgrade so as to catch the weekly mail to England. In course of conversation we ascertained that this gentleman (Capt McGrath) had been an RE officer during the war and was actually attached to Australian troops during the fighting at Bullecourt. He speaks Russian and is representing some British interests in Yugo Slavia. \n\nAn awful bable on station. Very crowded and all possible languages spoken simultaneously. Reached force about 10pm. Here there was a huge crowd of soldiers and civilians and again babel. After leaving the mountains we have passed through good agricultural country. \n","314":"\n\nArrived at about 4 am and was gratified to find we could go on direct to Belgrade, the railway bridge over the having been temporarily reinstated. Arrived at Belgrade station about 4.45. Passed baggage and left it in Stationmasters office. No conveyances available. Walked to Moscow Hotel in drizzling rain. No accommodation available – similar experience at Grand Hotel. Eventually secured rooms at the Crown of Serbia Hotel. Turned in at 6 am dead tired. Breakfast in Hotel Café at 10 am. Ascertained whereabouts of British Military Attache, Gen Plunkett, thanks to the kindness of a Salvation Army officer, who ran us round in his lorry. The Salvation Army has in Belgrade over £ 100000 worth of goods and stores of all kinds in order to help the local population, who have been for some time in a bad way and are short of many of the necessities of life. With Gen Plunkett called on Gen Michitieh Chief of General Staff of Servian Army. He arranged we should travel by boat tomorrow down the Danube from Belgrade\n\nto Orsova. This suits us excellently and gives us a chance to see the most interesting part of the Danube. The General has given instructions for cabins to be reserved for us. Called at Consuls office and had Passport visad. Met Sir Aubrey Young, British Minister. Called at Royal Palace and signed Visitors book. Made sundry purchases. Lunched at Hotel Moscow. Afterwards walked round Esplanade, Fort etc. A very fine panorama tho' the weather and light was unsuitable for photography. Called again at Gen Plunkett's office and had some official letters typed.\n\nDined at Grand hotel. Electric light failed during dinner and acetylene lamps brought into use. A frequent occurrence I am informed.\n\nTook carriage & boat. Gen Plunkett's corporal assisting with baggage. Arrived on board at 8.30pm. Cabin reserved. Wrote up diary.\n\nServian troops in Belgrade of splendid physique especially Palace guard. City poor – one main business street. Had very interesting conversation with Gen Plunkett concerning relation between Italians & Serbs, blockade of Fiume affecting as it does the Servian people. Serb army still mobilised. Communications generally are very bad.\n\nRate of exchange 1 pound English = 91 dinar \n","315":"\n\nLeft Belgrade at 5 am. Turned out at 7 am. Very restless night. Bed companions numerable and aggressive. Primitive sanitary and water arrangements. Decks crowded with an extraordinary mixture of humanity. A few well dressed evidently well to do people, the remainder Serb soldiers, peasants & refugees. All sorts of costumes. Soldiers smartly turned out. Peasant women in gay shawls and aprons, with kerchiefs for the head. Men wearing all sorts of garments, puttees wound round boots as well as legs. Astrakan and fur caps. Many wearing a light grey (nearly white) material similar to blanketting for trousers, baggy at hips and cut close at ankles. Seams and pockets outlined in black braid. Cargo miscellaneous – old agricultural implements and vehicle, hide etc. A British gentleman named Mr Parnell whose HQrs are at BudaPesth accompanied us. He is interested in wheat purchases for British Government. An RNVR officer Lt Higgins on boat last night. He is one of Admiral Troubridges staff, and told us much of interest re conditions of life in Servia and Roumania, relation of to Serb re Fiume and how the actual blockade of this town is seriously affecting the Serbs. He also gave us details of the Austrian Naval base in the Adriatic (Pola) and of two submarines about to be launched \n\nwhen Armistice was signed. At Pola I am informed the Austrians had an arsenal with huge stores of naval fuses and equipment of all kinds. Lt Higgins wife is a doctor who has worked among the Servian people for a very long time. We were also told in brief the doings of Flora , a woman who has fought with and among the Serbs for a long time and has won much distinction.\n\nAt 8 am stood onto wharf at - a very interesting old Turkish fortress here with walls crowned with towers. Indeed from now onward we shall see many interesting reminders of the Turkish conquest of the 16th century and subsequent occupation. A comparatively new building in the town with a high tower has been damaged by shellfire, and there are also other evidences of bombardment. Beside the local civilian Cemetery is a large military one. Austrian I think – with a large stone monument erected in the centre. Danube at this time about a mile wide. A murky stream – muddy coloured and rapidly flowing water, I should say from 6 to 8 knots per hour. It was interesting to note the type of breakfast partaken of by the peasants on board. Dark bread only – while soldiers had good white bread. Country hereabouts is not particularly interesting but passing Omoldova one sees the peculiar pointed rock Babalay rising up in the middle of the stream standing as a sentry guarding the entrance to the Defile of . On a pinnacle on the right bank there are the ruins of an interesting fortress looking backward from the steamer the towers stand up silhouetted against the skyline.\n\nPassing the small village of Dreukova the rapids of the Danube begin falling over many ledges of rock. Here and lower down at the Irongate Austrian Government has blasted out channels to permit of navigation tho' much more remains to be done. In the Defile of Kayan the Danube is only about 160 yards wide while its depth is over 200 feet. On the left bank continuing on to Orsova is the Szechenyi Road built in 1834-37. On the right bank May still be seen traces of a narrow road 5 to 6 feet wide constructed by TraJan in A.D. 103. The scenery in the Defile is magnificent and I took a number of photos. Arrived at Tekija on the Serbian side of the river off onto Orsova at 4pm (5pm Roumanian time)\n\nWhile waiting for a launch to come over from Orsova we saw a wedding reception and the Kola dance of the Serbs – very interesting but rather monotonous. Music two crazy violins, yet young and old entered into the dance with great gusto. Lt Commander Fletcher the Port Commandant at Orsova had in the meantime arrived with his launch and took us over to his quarters where he put us up. We dined with him at the Imperial Hotel \n\nHe is an extraordinary character evidently full of presence and is known as the King of Orsova. After dinner called on some friends of his and had some music.\n","316":"\n\nBreakfast late. Fletcher had much business to transact during the morning, so I did some reading. Lunched at Imperial Hotel and afterwards motored to the Iron gates and took some photos. The name \"Iron Gates\" does not as would imply refer to huge mountains guarding in a narrow passage the river proper. At this point the river is about ¾ mile wide – but the river here was barred by rapids until the Austrians cut away a canal on the right bank. Passed the island of Ada Kaleh still occupied entirely by Turks, but did not have time to visit it. At Orsova there is a big Sturgeon fishing industry with its attendant Caviarre. \n\nThere is no love lost between Serbs and Roumanians. The ships of neither country dare touch at the wharves of their neighbour, and there is constant friction, which admiral Troubridge and his Staff generally have to settle. Orsova is now occupied by Roumanian troops, who are not at all considerate to the Hungarian population. They loot what they will and on the slightest provocation apply the lash apparently never more or less than 25 strokes. Caught train from Orsova at 7pm for Bucharest. Dined on train. Our carriage and indeed all carriages, filthy damaged and insanitary. A bitter cold night no glass in windows, and no light other than candles provided by ourselves. Our two companions were Roumanian nuns. Much snow.\n","317":"\n\nArrived at Bucharest at 9 am. Secured room at Grand Boulevard Hotel with the assistance of the Staff of the British Military Attache. Lunched with Col Duncan (M.Attache) and , afterwards called on Commander in Chief and Minister for War, presenting letter of introduction. Arranged for trip to oil and battle fields commencing 8 am tomorrow and lasting three days. A Major as guide and a car provided by Minister for War. Dined at Hotel with Col Duncan Parnell and O'HaraWood. Bucharest a much finer town than Belgrade. Wood and Parnell off to the theatre. I remained in Hotel and entered up diary.\n\nRoumanian rate of exchange 1 pound British = 100 lei \n","318":"\n\nWe were supposed to leave our Hotel at 8 am this morning, but car did not arrive till 9. We set out to reach the oil Wells at Campania by about 12.30 or 1 o'clock, but owing to sundry punctures we did not arrive till 3pm. We were very hospitably entertained by the Manager & his wife to lunch even at that late hour, and afterwards went over the works. There are innumerable wells close together of an average depth of about 500 metres. Oil is withdrawn from the wells by means of long iron tubes about 8\" diameter with a valve at bottom. This is lowered down the well automatically fills and is withdrawn, all in the space of about 4 minutes. Works are again almost in full working order, having been reestablished after the British destruction when Roumania was overrun by the Boche. The refinery is an up to date concern and here we saw the crude oil as it comes from the earth being treated in various ways and the resultant products Benzine, benzol, petrol , , paraffin etc. Boilers are fed with \"oil fuel\". The main seaport is Constanza to which there is a pipe line some 4 hundred miles long for delivery of purified \"benzine\". Had almost interesting encounter with one of the chemists, concerning the future of Roumania. He reminded me that though the people are naturally intelligent their system of government and education in the past has been badly arranged. The residents in the town have had all the representation and all the education to the detriment of country classes. Now however voting privileges have been extended, votes must be recorded in default of which penalties are imposed and now all classes have their representation in parliament. Left Campain about 5.30 to 6pm and arrived at Ploesci at 8pm. Rooms arranged at Hotel Europe.\n","319":" \n\nLeft Ploesci at 8 am for Marasoti Battle fields, Halted at Buzeu at 11 am for petrol and oil. Roads very bad indeed. Arrived at Foscani at 2pm lunched by the roadside, then went over battle in detail with map. Battle lasted 15 days and was evidently of a very strenuous nature. Russians assisting Roumanians at outset of battle but gradually retired from the field. Returned to Buzeu arriving at 9.30pm, delayed owing to punctures. Billeted in the private home of a deputy, Wood and Roumanian Major in Hotel. Interesting country magnificent agricultural ground. Villages poor and filthy, towns better. Sanitary arrangements generally very defective. Roads desperately bad. Bridges have all been \"done in\" but are now in most cases repaired and useable.\n","320":"\n\nLeft Buzeu at 9 am. Car not satisfactory. Lunched at Ploesci rail station, continued journey by car arriving Bucharest 4.30pm. Interesting discussions with peasants on roadside re cattle horses etc taken from them by the Germans, and their non participation in present loot from Hungary. Bitterly cold day, we have found it specially so in the open car.\n\nCalled on Minister of War in Bucharest at 5pm and thanked him for his provision of car and guide. He has given us a car for our journey to the Danube tomorrow morning.\n\nWith Col Duncan called on M. Michu, but did not get a chance to see him. There is great excitement in Political Roumania over the Allied note calling on Roumania to take certain courses of action before October 2nd otherwise diplomatic relations will be broken of. The opening of Parliament yesterday was apparently a brilliant function tho' it is difficult to get a truthful indication of the peoples feelings, yet judging by the attitude of all deputies (including those from Transylvania and other new territories) there seems to be genuine loyalty to the Roumanian Crown.\n\nDined at grand Hotel with Col Duncan an American University Professor named Clarke, who is doing publicity work in America on behalf of Roumania and Italy. Owing to Grand Hotel being full Wood and I had to share room at the Palace Hotel.\n","321":"\n\nCar arrived at Hotel at 6 AM, at which hour we left for Rustchuck in Bulgaria via Giurgiu Arrived at Riverside side at 8 am. Left baggage and returned to town for usual light Continental breakfast. Actually crossed river at 11 AM, here nearly a mile wide. Lt British Intelligence Officer stationed at Rustchuck very kindly met us, looked after our baggage, arrangements for lunch, sleeping berths etc. Excellent lunch at Rustchuck consisting of soup, steak, bread, apples and wine for 3 persons plus wine and apples for our hamper 48 lap = 6 \/- stg. Sausages grilled and served on wooden plates, relic of old days.\n\nGuigiu much damaged, Rustchuck very little. Most Roumanium shells \"duds\". \n\nExcellent country from Bucharest to river, like that seen on our northern run. Much everywhere, as far as the eye can reach.\n\nHeavy snow all afternoon. Left Rustchuck for Sofia at 1.5pm. \n\nDined on board train from contents of our hamper.\n\nBulgarian rate of exchange 1 pound English = 170 \n","322":"\n\nMountainous Country (Balkans) and rapid rivers for final run to Sofia. Train running four hours late. Arrived at Sofia at 2.30pm. Car from British Military Mission met us and took us to the Legation where we are to stay. Gen Baird who is in charge of the British Mission is absent in London. The General's chief assistant is Major Neate RFA. He was for some time on Gen Chauvel's staff in Palestine and is looking after us well. Sr Lamb also present and other officers. Servants are employed who are Russians and had been prisoners for some time. They gave us some nice orchestral music during and after dinner. Arranged to continue journey tomorrow to Constantinople, also for food for our journey. Sofia a modern town with some good buildings. The British Legation buildings are very good indeed. I had a most interesting talk with Major Neate re Balkan states generally and their future. He also showed me copies of some most interesting reports sent by his General to the War Office. \n\nMonday 24th November\n\nAt 7.15 am caught train for Constantinople. Sleeping accommodation secured for us by British Mission Staff and also necessary provisions for the journey. Country snow clad everywhere. Rising sun on mountain tops as we left. Sofia very beautiful indeed. Mountainous country for some distance (Balkan Ranges) then wide valleys come into view – excellent soil and carrying heavy maize crops. Took a number of photos en route of country generally and Bulgar peasants etc. Philippopolis a good town passed about 4.30pm. \n\nTuesday 25th November\n\nI had an excellent nights rest. Refreshment car attached to car at 9 am. At 8.30 am passed Kouleli the Turkish Junction station for Salonica. Entered Turkey and passed through Adrianopole during small hours of the morning. Country now comparatively poor and uninteresting. Because of shortage of time our visit to Salonica front and Athens now cancelled. Lunched and dined in Restaurant car. Trains controlled by French. Our entry into Constantinople by rail from the North West rather tragic remembering our hopes and aspirations of","323":" Unfortunately it was dark before we entered Constantinople and in consequence missed the beauties of the last half hours rail run. Arrived at Station at 8.30pm. Officers from GHQ were there to meet us with car for ourselves and light lorry for our baggage. As we had been travelling very light this latter vehicle\n\nwas not required. Arrangements had been made for me to stay with Gen Milne the C in C at Therapia on the Bosporus, but on our late arrival and brevity of stay in Constantinople made me decide to accept the hospitality of \"A\" Mess in Pera. OHara Wood being accommodated in \"C\" Mess. General Duncan MGGS, late of 4th Aus Div whom I had hoped to see here, left a few days since for England. Had an interesting talk with Col Rawlinson an Engineers officer who is doing diplomatic and political work in Anotolia. He is a brother of Lord Rawlinson and incidentally told me of the high estimation in which his brother held the Australian troops. Rate of exchange £1 English = 350 Piastres\n","324":"\n\nAfter breakfast went to GHQ to arrange re tour of Gallipoli Peninsular. Saw Gen Anderson (GSO 1 acting for MGGS) and discussed details with him. Saw Gen Milne and had a most interesting conversation with him concerning the Campaign in Salonica and conditions generally in Turkey and Asia Minor. Received cable from London saying that Orsova had sailed on scheduled date (22nd inst) and that my family had embarked. It now only remains for me to ensure embarkation at Port Said. Called on Admiral de Robeck, High Commissioner as was as Naval Commander in Chief. He has arranged for a sloop to take us tonight to Chanak so that on","325":" inst we May look on Gallipolis fields. GHQ has arranged for S.S. Hapsburg to call at Chanak on morning of 28th and take us to Port Said. Arrangements made for Col Hughes A.I.F. to show us round Gallipolis fields. Col Anderson in the afternoon took us to see as much as possible of Constantinople in the limited time at our disposal. Visited three mosques. S. Sophia, Validech and mosque of Ahmed I, all intensely interesting. Took several photos. Tile work and mosaics of interiors very fine. Then on to the \"Great Bazaar\" where we made sundry purchases including a specimen of the Turkish Gallipoli medal and ribbon. Here we met Col Butler & his wife, Col Butler who was for so long doing intelligence work at Australian HQrs is now on the staff of Admiral de Robeck. Visited Turkish delight shop, saw sweets manufactured and bought some for the family. Bought some stamps for Chris, also Attar of Roses for Nell. Postcards will be secured for us by an officer at GHQ and sent on by the Hapsburg tomorrow. Everybody has been exceedingly kind to us and, and I regret exceedingly we could not stay here for at least a week. From Pera splendid views are obtained of the Bosphorus, Scutari, Golden Horn and the Princes Islands including Prinkepo. Had Passport Visaed and caught Naval Sloop (the \"Overton\") at 6.30pm. Constantinople entrancing by night, with its city, ferry, and shipping lights.\n","326":"\n\nFortune is not favouring us today. Owing to bad coal we are making very slow time and instead of arriving at Chanak at 7 or 8 oclock we did not disembark till 2pm. Exceedingly interesting journey down the Dardenelles. French warship aground at Gallipoli with salvage ship trying to get her off. Gallipoli an interesting town and old sites of ancient ruins still visible Sestos, Abydos, Dardanus etc. Took a number of photos including one of Saribair from the Maidos side. Passed wrecks of two Turkish ships torpedoed by our Submarines. \n\nBritish Naval Commodore at Chanak sent us on by launch to Kilid Bahr. Here French troops are in occupation and the French Commander did me the honour of a salute with a fanfare of trumpets thrown in. Troops are all Colonial. At \"Retreat\" the French troops have quite a pretty ceremonial, somewhat on our lines. Col Hughes took us in a Gossley Tender to see our old haunts on the Peninsular. It was intensely interesting to pass through the ruined town of Maidos to Gun Ridge and Gaba Tepe via Boghali, and Olive Farm - in reality the latter is an Oak Grove. Had to return in the dark, tho' a slender new moon was very helpful. I regret more than I can say that I had not time to spend a few days here – but my ship is getting nearer & nearer to Port Said and I cannot risk missing her. Stayed the night with our Australian officers who are looking after Australian graves in Gallipoli. They are located in Fort Kilid Bahr now named Marchand after French General. Magnificent fish for dinner. \n","327":"\n\n\"Hapsburg\" arrived at Chanak at 8 am. After breakfast at Kilid Bahr took a few photos, including a group of our Australian officers, then crossed in a Motor Launch to the ship. As I was boarding my ship, jumping from the launch to the gangway, my camera became detached from my belt and fell overboard – My only consolation is that the accident occurred almost at the end of our tour and not at the beginning or the middle.\n\nMet Col Broome RE on board. Last saw him in Berlin. He is off to Vladivostock in connection with repatriation or Russian prisoners. The son of a former Governor of West Australia he knows that Country very well. Ship Comfortable tho' the food very poor. She is an Austrian Lloyd liner of about 5000 tons Home port Trieste. O'Hara Wood and myself each have a double Cabins. Dead calm sea and beautiful weather.

Spending several months at Tidworth in control of the A.I.F. in England during demobilisation apparently was of no consequence or importance to Departmental or Ministerial officers – Fortunately ones Service generally was given - not for material reward, and the knowledge within one's own breast of having done the best possible under all circumstances is reward enough – At the hands of His Majesty the King I have all I need in the way of recognition.\n","350":" Left Melbourne\n","351":" At Sea\n","352":" Back home again in Sydney.
