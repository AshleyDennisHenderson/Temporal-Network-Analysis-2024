Unloading stone, timber, and cement, for use in building railway, also foundations for Big Guns etc. The arabs convey the stone etc. in small skips which means moving a little in a long time. The dhows are most clumsy looking craft, almost square in shape, with furrows sharply upturned, and big clumsy looking rudder. Masts which seem to almost touch the sky. In a favourable wind they have a good turn of speed. Saw most interesting incident. A big bull camel refused to work for an Arab, he pulled it down to its knees, then burying his teeth in its lip, bit until blood came.

Waterwheel (the same style as used two thousand years ago) pulled round by an old cow, blindfold, also plow, drawn by two cows, just a log of wood sharpened one end. Boy made us a present of peanuts. The Arab women no matter how dirty all have their faces veiled. \n\nThe Arab and the Egyptian Women are very graceful when young, especially when seen carrying water they used stone vessels for water, and seem to carry everything on their heads.

Revielle blown at 6 instead of 6.30 and first parade at 6.30 instead of 7. Reminds us of the old days at Liverpool and the 2 parks. Arab came round our hut selling eggs, 2 for 1 P.T. we beat down his price to 12 for 4 P.T. and purchased 3 dozen He gave Payne a bottle of \"bakshee\"milk, so we made egg flips in the morning, had poached eggs with our meal for dinner, and with the eggs and milk left over we made a custard for tea. The best days feed we have had for some time and didn’t we enjoyed it.\n","87":"\n\nYesterday we were issued with tobacco and matches (2 boxes matches, 2 oz. tob. per man.) tobacco in 4 oz tins. I tossed \"Bricky\" and won the whole 4 oz. Wrighty got into holds with \"Gerty\" yesterday over dropping a Tobacco tin and is \"tattoo\" this morning. \"Doby\" was paraded before the \"Col\" who talked to him like a father, Doby was dismissed, and then he brought a charge against Rumming for insulting language, but as the Col. appealed to him to drop it, he did so. Poor old \"Wrighty\" must have killed a bloomin’ Chinaman at some time, as his case was a very weak one, yet he got 4 days pack drill, so he’ll be careful with his tobacco tins now. Payne procured a billy-full of milk and we had cocoa for supper, we are living very high lately.\n","88":"\n\nParade in full marching order this morning. The crowd out for a route march.

This afternoon the Officers got a party of Arabs to give us a demonstration of mat making. It was very interesting and with a bit of practice we should be able to make mats for ourselves out of rushes and palm leaves. Bricky bought a camera and we spent the evening trying to make pictures, got a few good ones.\n\nThursday 10th\t\n\nIts about time we got a reply to our first batch of letters. Bricky took more photos. Brady, Bricky and self spent the evening printing gaslight pictures, some beauties. We ran out of supplies, so had to miss supper.\n","91":"\n\nWeather getting warmer. Bricky borrowed files from Cosier and we printed a few jolly good pictures, about 7.30 p.m., Ross, Woodsy, Doby, Kirby and I were just settled down to a quiet game of nap, when we heard several people sing out like mad \"Stop that man, Stop him.\" Of course we all rushed out and saw the whole bloomin’ ambulance rushing round in all directions, we joined in the chase, but who or what we were chasing no one seemed to know. After tearing around for a while we heard someone say \"They’ve got him\", so we returned to camp, and found out that the officers had raided the gambling school, and the chap they chased was one who got away. We returned to our own little game, played on till first post, then we had cocoa toast and jam for supper and retired to Bunk. \n","92":"\n\nThis morning on parade, the heads enquired for information regarding the gambling schools, but of course no one \nknew\n anything about ‘em. \n\nBricky and I taking more photos, getting real good at ‘em, spent the afternoon printing.

The train was not in so we played cards while waiting for it. Left Serapeum about 4, and arrived Teb-el-Kebir about 6.30, after a bumpy train ride across the desert. At Nefiche we pulledup for a while. \"Bricky\" took a picture of a charming Arab girl who was selling oranges. One old chap amused the crowd by dancing the can-can. On arrival at T-Kebir we had to turn to and unload all our gear. I was one of a party of 6 told off to carry a big table, and we were all jolly glad to arrive at our camp site. When the main body arrived we all had to pitch tents, and were very glad to get to bed, as we were tired out. It was quite the hardest day I’ve had for some time.\n\n18.\n","105":"\n","106":"\n\nLetter from Lill. Plenty of canteens around wet and dry. Plenty of gambling too.

Wrighty and Billsy and I walked around the canteens in the evening, plenty of beer flying, small parties of men with candles lying about every where gambling. Looked through curiosity shop, but must wait until pay day to make any purchases. \"Bluey\" Stanton and Bedville played up and were put in the Guard Tent. Peter H. left a note to say he’d call again tomorrow. While spotting around we came across \"Rass. asleep among the Big Guns.

Peter H. and Harry Maughn came to see me both looking very well. Harry was at Anzac for 3 months, and Peter is in the","108":" Battalion. Went for a walk and had a yarn which I very much enjoyed. Had a look around the cemetery where the men are buried who fell at Tel-el-Kebir in 1882. It is a very pretty little spot and is well cared for. Just behind it is another piece of ground where the men of the A.I.F. are buried. A pathetic feature about the old Cemetery, is that a number of the wooden crosses bear the inscription \"UNKNOWN\". We saw two English ladies in the cemetery. They were quite a treat for sore eyes, as the only ladies we have seen since leaving Melbourne were the ones who passed in Boats on the Canal. \n\nMonday Feb.28th\n\nTurned out at 6.30 with the rest of the crowd. The first drill I have done for nearly 3 months. Rather a stiff morning drilling, curried stew for dinner, stretcher drill in the afternoon.

We made some toast, and \"Lane\" produced some patent coffee with milk and sugar already mixed, so we had quite a banquet. Turned in about 2 and slept until Breakfast time. Passed away the time reading and sewing buttons on my pants. Time of parades altered. First parade 8.30 instead of 6.30. Breakfast at 7 instead of 7.45.\n","114":"\n\nVery hot Had field day, stretcher drill and bandaging. I was lucky enough to be sent out as patient, so had easy time. The label I wore was \"Bayonet wound, left thigh\" In the afternoon Lieut.

Sec. Men’s Rep. and later on was elected to the position of Secretary. \"She\" went with Capt. North, Ross & Woodward into Cairo to purchase Sports material. Now he drives us silly, as he even talks cricket and football in his sleep, and leaves his things lying about all over the tent. This evening at tea time, Alec our corporal cook and Pt. Poulton had a barney and Poulton gave Alec a crack. Now he’s on tattoo for striking an N.C.O. Bricky had some photo material, so now he’s busy again making pictures.

This morning we arose at Reveille, polished our boots and leggings were inspected by Capt. North. \n\nMonday 6th Trip To Cairo.\n\nThe orderly Officer. Dashed down to the station, purchased, our tickets, 13 P.T. return and boarded the train for Cairo, The train left about 7.20 and after a very pleasant trip in the train. We arrived in Cairo at 9.30 a.m. on both sides of the Railway the land is under cultivation as far as the eye can see. The sweet water canal, which is a branch of the Nile, runs right along and the water is distributed by a good canal system over the farms. At intervals there are small villages which consist of a heap of squalid looking huts many grubby looking children, a few dogs, camels and donkeys and fowls and ducks in galore. Each farm has its old fashioned water wheel which is usually pulled round by an ox or donkey. The women seem to work just as hard as the men carrying bundles of produce, milking cows and driving large herds of goats about to pasture. We saw an Arab, with an assorted team, ploughing, (a camel and a donkey) and they worked together well. We arrived in Cairo feeling jolly hungry, so we went to the nearest restaurant and had breakfast, which consisted of 4 eggs each, and bread and butter and coffee. \"Billsy\" May would have liked some jam, but was not \"game\" to ask for it. As soon as we had eaten we took the tram for the Pyramids. It took about 40 mins to get there and the fare was 1 p.t. It is very interesting ride, and we crossed the Nile. I \nthink\n 3 times. The Bridges are fine piece of work, but I forget their names excepting that of the Kaiser-el-Nil, which is the largest. On the way out we passed a big crowd of English Tommies marching along and they looked very well and in the pink of condition. We unloaded from the tram, together with an Arab Guide, who we engaged to show us round. \n\nFirst of all we gazed on the Pyramid of Cheops the largest of the 6, which rears its head up towards\n\n21.\n","118":"\n\nthe sky for 400 feet. There are 5 other Pyramids of various sizes, and then the other wonder, the Sphinx. This must have been a very beautiful piece of work when it was first erected, as it still shows signs of it, but a few odd thousand years will make a difference to anything. The Arab also took us into several tombs of ancient Egyptian Kings, and their wives and daughters. The carving on them was most interesting and the guide pitched a yarn about each of them. One thing I noticed in particular was that when giving us the history of the various Royal Families. He would say this is King so and so and his wife and his daughter but no mention of the Wives or daughters names, so evidently women folk didn’t count for much in those days, but what a difference \nnow.\n We also visited the temple of the Sphinse and Campbell’s tomb. This tomb is the burial place of some great Egyptian princess, and was excavated by Col. Campbell, whom it is named after. Her coffin can be plainly seen. It is carved out of a solid block of blue marble. After seeing all this we paid off our guide 15 disasters (5d each) and took a ½ P.Ts. worth of tram ride to the Zoo. This is a fine place. There is a good collection of birds and animals, and the gardens are beautiful. We ran into a party of Egyptian kiddies and they were very interested in Billeys gold tooth. I took a snapshot of them and Stan Wright took another, and I promised to send the teacher a picture, if they turned out good. \n\nWe returned to Cairo and had some light refreshment then we took a Gharry and drove to Mouskey St. where the Bazaars are. This is a very interesting part of the city and one could spend hours there. Here we saw the silk weavers, metal works in brass, silver, copper etc. grinding spices, making jewellery and amber adornments. There were beautiful things for sale and made one wish ones banking account was a large one. We wandered around these narrow streets for about 2 hours, then we returned to the vicinity of Shepheards’, had tea (not at Shepheards’) and by this time it was near 7 o’clock, so we got aboard the train and arrived back at Tel.el-Kebir about 9.30 p.m. after a most eventful and enjoyable day. \n\nTuesday 7th \n\nWoke up feeling jolly tired, went for route march. Wrote to Lill and developed the snaps which only turned out fair, the Sphinse was the best one of the lot.\n","119":"\n\nField day, Nursing Section cooks and transport all out, together for the first time. We were just settled down nicely to our work when Serg. Marshall arrived to inform Major Williams that Capts. North and Donald had received orders to join the 2nd Division at once, so he and Capt. Wooster returned to camp to say Goodbye to them, and our gallant B. Section was left in charge of Serg. \"Cut it out\" the result being – a days loafing. We got back to camp about 3.30 and I printed a few pictures.\n\n22.\n","120":"\n\nBusy morning digging holes for incinerator, we got down about 8 feet, then A.Section came along and finished it. \"Murph\" Kath Williams friend called to see me and we had a great old yarn about N.

Wrote straight away in return.\n","122":" \n\nCold windy day, had field day, with waggons, was lucky enough for once, and sent out as patient.

Picked up parcel ready for posting to Lill.\n","126":"\n\nInnoculated again. Made us all very sick. 48 hours spell to get it over.\n","127":"\n\nWe get a double dose next time so we are looking forward to a lively time. Bricky is in Cairo, having a good time, but his turn will come to-morrow. He has just arrived and laughed at the idea of his being sick.\n","128":" \n\nStill resting, our arms are all very sore and faces looking glum, it is very nice to have no drill or fatigue work to do. Bricky, the Hero, is in Hospital so now it’s our turn to smile. To-day a batch of War Fund Comforts came in. Tobacco, cigarettes, soap and lollies. I drew soap for my share, but as I have plenty of Tobacco it doesn’t matter. They say it never rains in Egypt, but it looks very much like it to-day.\n\nSaturday 18th \n\nHad my second turn on picquet. Went on last shift with Stan Wright. Poor \"Maud\" got kicked, broke her leg and had to be shot. The boys gave her a decent funeral, as she \n\nwas such a dear old thing. \n\nOur worthy Sec. Payney has arranged a soccer game with the Welsh Fusilies, who arrived\n\n23.\n","129":"\n\nYesterday and are camped near us so we are looking forward to an interesting match.\n","130":"\n\nChurch Parade, all of the 8th Brigade with the exception of the gallant F.Amb. paraded in their helmets and colours. Our helmets have been in the SM. Store for about a fortnight but they are keeping them for the flies to blow before issuing, as they do everything. The soccer match came off this afternoon and the Royal Welse Fusiliers were beaten, 2 goals to 0 Ben Harris, the cook of A. Section, scored both. I \nwrote a long letter to Lill\n using the new green envelope for the first time. Also sent a field Service card to Mother and one to Kath. We dug a trench round our tent to-day, as it rained very heavily last night and almost washed us out. Bill Lancaster, Payne and I missed Church parade as all our clothes were wet.\n","131":" \n\nStretcher drill, jolly warm work. Water cart in use at last. 79 horses and 30 or 40 men in the transport, yet the poor cooks fatigue have had to cart water.\n","132":"\n\nOn Cooks fatigue. It’s not a bad job now the water fatigue is cut out and A. Section were inoculated on Monday and our turn comes again tomorrow. One good job, it does ot have so much effect as the last lot.\n","133":"\n\nInnoculated again, by the time they have finished innoculating, we ought to be immune from every bloomin’ disease under the sun. They issued our crowd with helmets to-day, but they didn’t have one big enough for me, so I’ve got to wait.\n","134":"\n\nAnother days loafing to get over our sore arms. We paraded in our helmets to-day for the first time, and they looked very well. Gee whiz! Here I am passing over yesterday’s great events. The Prince of Wales inspected the camp to-day. We were busy all the morning making our camp look as smart as possible. Then for about 2 hours we were hanging around with our tunics and belts on, but the Prince didn’t have time to come and have a look at us. It was good to see him inspecting the Infantry Battalion. They looked real well formed up out in the desert with their bayonets flashing in the sun. As the Prince reviewed each Battalion they put their helmets on their bayonets and gave 3 roaring cheers. In the afternoon a big mail came in, and I got 3 letters from Lill 1 from Nell and the Photo, Hooray. It was good to gaze on Lill’s dear old face again. Although the picture is not too good. I wrote back, straight away, Bad luck my pen has gone bung, so now I’ve got to fall back on the pencil. There is some talk about our mail being kept back in Egypt for some time. This certainly looks like business.\n\nFriday 24th \n\nIssued with helmets and summer suits. The piggarees take some putting on, they are about 10 yds long\n\n24.\n","135":"\n\nand require some handling. I had an appointment with the Dentist for 12 midday, but as I arrived a few minutes late I had to put it off till to-morrow. We are still having a glorious loaf, after our painful period of innoculations.\n\nSaturday 25th \n\nSpent a few painful minutes in the dentist’s chair. My word, the dentists earn their money alright, every time I have been near their hut they have been up to their necks in work. We paraded in our summer suits and helmets this morning, for the first time and right well they looked. Something is evidently going to happen our tent Division went away last night for \"somewhere unknown\" To-day we have been busy loading up our gear, and taking down the few remaining tents. Last night, as the tent division took our tents away, we had to sleep in the open. Bill May and I went for a stroll down the lines and came across a circus (this was last night) and as every one seemed to be going in \"baksheesh\" Willy and I followed suit and got a good 2 hours fun for nothing. The people running the show tried to get the crowd without tickets to go out, but they stood no earthly chance and wisely decided to carry on with the show. This afternoon we were issued with tobacco and cigarettes, also some of us, who were lucky, got shaving and toilet soups. Tonight I am guarding the water cart so I can sleep in the guard tent, and miss the dew. We had Plum pudding for dinner today, they must have had a jolly supply of puddings, as we have had it 3 times during the last week.\n\nSunday 26th\n\nLast night I was on water picket, so this morning I enjoyed a \"sleep in\" while the others turned out on Parade. \n\nParcel went away\n, the remainder of our stores, have been taken away. It is a jolly hot day, and the flies are very lively. We are to leave here to-morrow morning early, for an unknown destination, so early to bed. Yesterday the parcel went home to Lill.\n\nMonday 27th\n\nMarch of the 14th Brig. across the desert.\n\nThis morning (after another night spent sleeping on the ground) we turned out about 4.30 stacked our blankets in heaps of 25, ready for loading the camels. Had breakfast tea, bully beef and bread, and loaded the remainder of our stores on the Transport waggons, then we formed up in readiness for starting on the \"Great March across the Desert\" from Tel-el-Kebir to Ismalia. This is the first time this march has been undertaken since 1889 when the force under Sir Garnet Wolschy marched from Ismalia and fought the famous battle against the Arabs at Tel-el-Kebir. I understand they took a day and a half and made a forced march, but we were given 2 days and a half to do the distance. We started off at about 7 a.m. and to the cheering music of the band started across the desert at a nice steady march. It was good going for the first few miles and then it commenced to get hot and the sweat began to pour out. The infantry carry a very heavy pack and as we got over a few miles they threw\n","136":"\n\n25\n\naway shirts and pants and any old things at all to lighten their load. A mob of Arabs followed us up and they were very well so far as wearing apparel went. Before leaving camp we were issued with \"Iron Rations\" Bully Beef and Biscuits, after marching for an hour we had a few minutes spell, which \n\nwas very necessary as it was getting rather warm, and the gallant 8th were losing more sweat than they had ever done before. It was not bad walking generally, but now and then we struck patches of loose sand, into which we sunk, over our boot tops and was very hard on the transport horses. Before we started we were given strict orders to be very careful with our water, the wisdom of which proved itself, before we had gone many miles. We halted at 11.30 for dinner, which consisted of Bully Beef and Biscuit a little jam, and water, the water in our bottles was quite hot, but all the same it was worth its weight in gold. During our dinner spell, a few hundred Arabs sprang up from somewhere, and hung around waiting for what was left of our \"banquet\". The transport waggons had kept up with us, and it was very nice to have even their shade as the sun was blazing hot by this time. We did not start off again till about 1 o’clock and this spell gave the stragglers from the Infantry a chance to catch up with their units again. We had not gone far when the poor old Infantrymen began to drop out with sore feet, and generally knocked up, so our O.C. Col.Shepheard sent some of us out in Stretcher squads to assist them, as much as possible. Lorry Trousdale was No. 4 in our squad, which consisted of Stan Wright, Billy May and myself. We had the First Aid satchel with us, also a Field Service Water bottle, and the chaps who fell out were very glad of a drink of water and a sprinkle of Boric Acid for their feet. \n\nAs far as possible we put their packs on the waggons and those who were very bad had to get a ride. We were all jolly glad when \nMoama\n, our first camp, came in sight, as although our packs were much lighter than the Infantry packs, and we also got an extra half bottle of water, we were pretty well knocked up, and the thought of a cup of tea and a few hours sleep was pleasant. Our blankets were brought along by camel train, and they arrived just as soon as we did. On arrival in camp we were issued with Biscuits and jam and best of all hot tea. After this was over we sat around and smoked and yarned for a time, then we got our blankets, made our bunks, and with the desert for a floor and the sky for a roof we slept as sound as a top until \"reveille\" next morning. \n\nTuesday 28th\n\nAt about 4.30 the orderly Sergeant, Bob Roberts called a lot of abuse on his head by rousing us. It was almost dark, what light there was came from the moon and a few odd stars. It was a great sight to see those 5 thousand odd men turning out, some bad tempered and some good, some growling others cracking jokes. We stacked our blankets again, rolled our coats, packed haversacks filled water bottles, then we had breakfast,\n","137":"\n\nTues. Mar.28 \n\nDesert March.\n\nBilly-hartsee.\n\nmore Bully beef biscuits, and jam and tea, a fatigue party was told off to stay behind and clean up the camp. We only received \none\n bottle of water per man, and with this we had to clean our teeth and have our morning bath. The sweetwater canal ran almost along our camp, but we were not allowed to use it, as it contained some germ, which was better outside of us than in. \n\nTo the enlivening strains of the Band the column moved off at about twenty minutes to seven. What a difference the Band makes to a march, the crowd stepped out like veterans and looked fit to march any where, but, oh, what a contrast to our arrival at Moaska, our second stop. Quite a number of men dropped out even in the first mile with sore feet, and generally knocked up and as the day wore on and it got hotter and hotter and the water bottles got empty, they were dropping out by scores and were scattered all over the desert. After each spell the band struckup its liveliest tunes, but music won’t heal a man’s sore feet, or quench his thirst and they continued to drop out faster and faster. We were sent out in squads again and did the best we could but our supply of water was very limited,, and we could not do much. The horses in the waggons were getting knocked up, too, so the wagon orderlies got orders to carry the mens packs for a mile and then put them off. Talk about being hot, I have experienced some hot days in Australia, but here with the sun beating down on the sand, and the flies biting us, it was enough to make one demented. The spell for dinner was very welcome and our squad just flopped down in the shade of a waggon, with our tongues hanging out. The force had by this time lost about a third of its number. I felt sorry for the poor beggars out there in the desert, with no shade of any description. It was a great relief to take off our clothes and have a rub down with a towel, to get rid of the stale perspiration. \n\nWe started off again at about 12.30 after having had a spell for an hour and a half. The Band struck up again and we started off to Moaska, about 8 or 9 miles away up to this time we had fairly solid ground to march on but now we got into the loose sand and it was jolly hard work plodding on, over the boot tops in the soft sands and the sun pouring on us. We scattered out across the desert in squads, doing the best we could with our limited supply of water. Some of the poor beggars were quite delirious. One chap we came across a Sergeant kept singing out for his mother, he had torn almost all his clothes off and was rolling about in the sand. We picked him up and almost carried him for about 2 miles when we came across a corporal of the same Company, so we left him in his care and made the best of our way into camp, as our water bottles were empty and we could do no good, besides being almost beat ourselves. Billy May and Stan Wright carried the packs of some of the fellows for a considerable distance, but were mighty glad to drop them again. It was pitiful to see the hundreds, or I might say thousands of men lying about\n","138":"\n\nin all attitudes, all singing out for water, and we hadn’t a drop to give them, some of them had erected shelters by fixing their bayonets on their rifles, sticking them in the ground and tying their waterproof sheets to them. Out of 5 thousand men who left Moama that morning only 300 or 400 managed to last out the distance, the remainder being scattered over the desert. \n\nSome of our chaps, who got into camp early filled their water bottles and went out again to the fellows who were stuck for a drink. The New Zealanders were camped here in great numbers and as soon as they heard how things were, they harnessed up their horses and went out with water carts, and ambulance waggons to pick up those who were left behind. Their cooks also turned to and made tea for us and did everything in their power to render assistance, which was greatly appreciated. It was freely circulated around that camp that a number of men had died from exhaustion, but I don’t suppose we shall ever get the true facts about the casualty list. Stan Wright Billsy May and I went down to the Canteen and had a feed. We got 3 eggs each, some bread a cup of coffee and finished up with ice cream, which we greatly enjoyed, especially Billsy May, his eyes actually sparkled when the Ice Cream came on. My word Mrs. A.J. Moore if ever your husband \"goes sore\" about any meal you put in front of him, just mention the word \"Egypt\" to him and he’ll close up like a book. We got our blankets, made our bunks on the dirty dusty desert and slept like innocent babes. The doctors had a busy time, giving what assistance they could to the men who dropped out, but, like us, they could not do much, as the one incessant cry was for \"Water Water\" About half way through the sand we came across an oasis, two beautiful lakes, with palm trees around. We could hardly believe our eyes, \n\nbut we did not waste any time before we stripped off our clothes and dived in and joined the hundreds of others who were there before us. If ever a swim was appreciated it was that one it refreshed us up wonderfully and we plodded on again like \"two year olds\" All the same we were mighty glad to strike our camp. Our squad arrived in camp about 4.30 after doing 21 miles across the sun scorched desert. It was easily the roughest walk I ever did in my life. Now we only have about 6 or 7 miles to do to get to our destination, some distance beyond Ferry Post.\n\nWednesday 29th\n\nArose about 7 and had a good breakfast, Bacon, Bread, Jam and tea, and got ready to finish our famous march. We left Moaska about 9. Just after breakfast the Prince of Wales put in appearance, and was soon surrounded by the crowd, who cheered him to the echo. He is not a bad looking boy and looks well on his horse. He was snapped by hundreds of cameras, so I am hoping to get a picture later on. As we marched out of camp we cheered the New Zealanders, as they had looked after us so well. The P. of W. reviewed us as we marched by and came in for more cheers. He must get sick and tired of cheers as he has to \n","139":"\n","140":"\n\nkeep saluting and smiling all the time. After about half an hours marching we came to Ismalia. This is a beautiful town, gardens and big shady trees everywhere. We marched along the canal banks for a good distance and the general remarks were, how different the outlook was not to yesterday. Now it is shady and cool and good roads to walk on, then \n\nit was raging hot and burning sand to walk on. 3 of our men were left behind. Bricky Howard, and –Pitt of A. Section in Hospital and Hugh Reid is still \"missing\" leaving Ismalia, we struck the desert once more and got a bit downhearted again, as we hoped to be camped near the canal. Instead of that we are stuck out here in striking desert, short of water and almost driven mad with flies even now we are not settled, but have to go out 8 miles further in the desert, where there is nothing but eternal sand. After dinner we pitched a few tents, then Major Williams took us down to the Canal, about a miles away for a swim, which we thoroughly enjoyed.\n","141":"\n\nIt seems as though our troubles are only just beginning. This morning we were looking forward to a decent feed of stew, but the cooks discovered there was kerosene in the water, so stew being \"off\" the menu, we had to fall back on bread and Jam. Just after breakfast a sand storm swept across and carried tents and everything before it. After it had passed we had to pitch our tenets again, and search for the things that had been blown away, and we are supposed to be \"resting\" to get over the effects of the march. Last night the mail came in I got 3 letters 1 from Mother and 3 from France. We have just got our kit bags back again, which we thought were gone for good. They are not sending any mail away from Egypt, so it is not much use writing, \"Lizzie\" Payne has just arrived full of news, so I’ll have to knock off writing.\n","142":"\n\nHad busy day pitching tenets. It was read out in routine orders that we were to get everything ready for receiving 150 patients. These were the fellows who got \"knocked up\" during our famous desert march. All the waggons and horses were in use and they brought ‘em in, in double quick time. A 6 of us were in our party, pitching tents and we had to move lively, as the patients were coming in on top of us. None of them were very sick most of them were suffering from blistered feet, and it only meant a couple of days rest to put ‘em right. About 6.45 the cry went up \"Fall in for pay\" – needless to say, we fell in very smartly, as almost everyone was \"broke\" I drew 100 P.T. but had to pay our 70 P.T. which I borrowed when we went on the trip to Cairo. I only had 30 P.T. left, but it is very nice to be out of debt again.\n\n29\n","143":"\n\nAll Fool’s Day, but the crowd are too jolly tired to play jokes. Most of our patients belong to Battalions who are camped near us, and many of them rejoined their units to-day, only the sick ones remaining. The 56th are on one side of us and the 54rd on the other. A big crowd came into camp to-day from around Cairo you can always tell a crowd of \"New Chums\" as they carry such a lot of superfluous gear, while the older hands travel light as possible. Most of the chaps that came in to-night had walking sticks. We had another hard day to-day. Billsy May, Rass, Trousdale, and I were carting stone to fill up a grease trap. It was a dusty job and I was glad when we had finished. Thenn we went down to the Canal and had a swim. When we got back we were issued with Cigarettes, I got 3 very \nwelcome papers from France today.\n","144":"\n\nAs usual just as we have our camp nice and comfortable we get orders to move again. No time for Church Parade to-day, its \"all hand on deck\" taking down tents and loading our stores to go out to the Road Head and join up with the","145":" Brigade Battalionss, who are already camped out there. I was one of a stretcher squad told off to carry our few remaining patients over to the 15th F. Amb. after this we struck tents and loaded them on the waggons. Jack Fallon had a film, so we had a few snapshots taken, one of us preparing for the march. We left about 5.30 and arrived at Rail Head about 7. We bivouacked here for the night, out in the open. We were jolly tired and all of us slept soundly. Even the crowd in the Arabs camp failed to keep us awake, although they were howling pretty well all night.\n","146":"\n\nI was told off as Picket from 10 till 12, and was jolly glad when it was over, so that I could get back to my bunk again.\n\nAnother busy day sorting out tents and stores. A.Section are to go with the 31 and 32 Batts. who are camped a few miles away from the","147":" and 30th, to whom we are to be attached. We had everything finished by midday, but did not start on the march till after tea, as it was so bloomin’ hot. Besides our full marching kit we had to carry our own blankets, as there was not any room for them on the waggons. This is the first time the two sections have been separated since the 8th has been formed. Major Newell went with A.Section, and Major Willliams came with us. It was only about 3½ miles to our destination, but we were all jolly glad to get there as we have done so much marching lately.\n\nTuesday 4th \n\nWrote to Lill.\n We pitched one bell tent for a couple of sick men, then laid our blankets out on the sand and slept peacefully till about 7.30 next morning. Our white Bags are not with us, and we haven’t any writing paper so I cant write home.\n\n30.\n\nBread and Jam for breakfast and Tea. Our stores were arriving, so we were soon hard at work again pitching another camp. We set up a cookhouse, pitched tents, dug garbage pits and were jolly buy making things comfortable. Phil May and I were told off to cart stones on a stretcher, to fill up a pit for fouled water. We had stew for dinner, and the usual ration of cheese and jam for tea. Our water is brought by canal pack for the Batties, but we have our own water cart and are allowed 2 water bottles full a day to drink and also to wash in and also to do our washing in, so it set us thinking for a while. Now we wash ourselves first, then wash our socks and things in the same water, then we strain the dirty water through a bag of sand and then the rinsing.\n\nWednesday 5th\n\nAnother busy day pitching tents, filling sand bags and making latrines. I wrote Home to Lill on some odd pieces of paper, which I got from the orderly room. Payney and I were told off to put sand bags under the stretchers in the hospital tent. We had bacon for breakfast, and curry for dinner. The afternoon we had to ourselves, and after tea we had to do a quarter of an hour each at digging a hole in the sand to drain away water and bury garbage. Then our days work finished.\n","148":"\n\nOn picquet with Mackinlay and Mason. The rest of the crowd went for a march with Capt. Lind. In the afternoon we got our \n\nKit bags and Capt.Lind gave us a few hints, on what to carry in our packs. Peter H. came over to see me, and we had a good old yarn.\n","149":"\n\nAnother busy day digging latrines, Jolly hard work too, in this boiling sun. This morning we had boiled bacon for breakfast, which was a pleasant change. We \"turned to\" again in the afternoon and finished off the job. Capt.Irving \"The big Roam\" sent over to the canteen and got 3 botts. of beer, with which we quenched our thirst. After this Capt Lind. inspected our kits, to see what was missing\n","150":"\n\nReceived a letter from Lill\n, blowing me up, but never mind. Hooray, on cooks fatigue. Gee it’s rotten wood they get and its jolly hard work cutting it, we had boiled rice for Breakfast and Risssoles for Dinner. Wrote long letters to Lill in the afternoon also one to France.\n","151":"\n\nChurch parade, 30th Batt. Band played hymn music and jolly fine it sounded, too, out in the Desert. I wrote a good \nlong letter to Lill\n in the afternoon also one to Mother, then I slept till tea time.\n","152":"\n\nOn picquet again. Our \"Long looked for\" colours arrived\". Bill May went down to Headquarters to take Wood’s place as waggon orderly. Woods has gone into orderly room. The Engineers are busy building a cook house and meat store, so that is a pretty good hint that we are going away, to-day Keeney\" and I \n","153":"\n\ngot some printing paper from Mac\", and we spent the afternoon printing.\n\nTuesday 11th\n\nWent for March with Capt.Lind. He had us on distance judging for a time, and then we sat down and he told us all about Anzac. After we returned to camp we got busy sewing on colours. In the evening we went out practising signalling.\n","154":"\n\nFierce wind sprang up and nearly blinded us with sand. We were out on a march but got back to camp in double quick time, where we were kept busy for a few hours pegging down tents and weighting them down with sand bags, Capt Lind is away on 2 days leave.\n","155":"\n\nSand storm still raging, Our tents were nearly buried in the sand when we turned out this morning. Capt Irving took us out for a route march. We were sitting down having a spell when an aeroplane flapped down almost on top of us. Something had gone wrong with their engine, so they had to alight and send back to the aerodrome for new fittings. It was very interesting to see the instruments they carry, even to a wireless outfit. They also carry a very serviceable looking quickfiring gun. When we got back to camp, the sand storm was so bad that the cooks brought the stew round to our tents and served it out. It was almost dark with the flying sand. Some of the sand hills round our camp are blown beyond recognition. We pegged out tent down and put sandbags on ‘em, even then it was just as much as we could do to keep ‘em down. The mail is a jolly long time coming, haven’t had a decent mail for quite a month, beginning to wonder what is wrong. Wrote a long letter to Cis.\n","156":"\n\nHooray, got 2 letters this morning one from France and 1 from Cis, telling me of Mother’s departure for Sydney, which must have been exciting. It poured in rain all the morning and the crowd out on the march got wet through. I was one of a party told off to square up the camp, so was lucky for once and kept dry.\n","157":"\n\nPeter came to see me, last night. His Batt. the","158":" and the 29th marched away this morning about half past five. Their bands woke us up, and we turned out and watched them go by. The 57th and 58th Battalions came in this morning and took their places. To-day I was told off as Sanitary Police for 3 days, with \"Mulga Bill\", for a partner.\n","159":"\n\nChurch Parade, without a band, miserable. We miss the music now the","160":" and 30th are away. \nWrote to Lill\nenclosed number of snapshots. Sanitary Police is a good job, as we miss all Parades, and are not killed with hard work.\n\nMonday 17th\n\nParty of 12 went into Ferry Post for a swim. This number\n\n32.\n\nare to go in each day, so it’s something to look forward to. We packed our tent around the sand bags and made it much cooler. It was read out to us on Parade this morning. The Light Horse had engaged with a party of Turks at a place called Jiff-Jaffa. We lost 1 man killed and 33 taken prisoners, four were wounded, also captured an Austrian Engineer Officer. This is the first scrap that has taken place since we’ve been on this Canal Defence, so we are all mighty interested. Tonight there is a Parade from 6 till 9, but thank the Lord I’ll miss it as I’m Sanitary Police. \n\nTuesday 18th’\n\nMade one of a swimming party, Jack Keen and Mac also in the mob. They both brought their cameras and took several good snaps which I hope turn out alright. We enjoyed a swim in the canal, then we went into Ismalia, and had a good look around. \n\nFirst of all we got a lift on a Motor Ambulance, then we got into a transport waggon, and finished the trip in an Arab’s cart. We had a good dinner, then took a stroll round the town. It was a great treat to be in town again, after having been in the desert for so long. We got the train back again at 3.30 p.m. and arrived back in camp just in time for tea.\n","161":" \n\nRoute marching with the big Roan jolly hard work walking through the soft sand. We did about 10 miles and were jolly glad to get back to camp and have dinner. Big Mail, came in I got 1 letter from \nFrance and a welcome paper.\n","162":"\n\nThis morning Capt.Irving took us out to the \"Spinx Outpost about 4 miles away from our camp, and set us on digging to make a dug out for a Dressing \"Station\" We took 10 minutes spell each with the shovels and I never knew 10 minutes to last so long. We arrived back in camp about 12.30, and did full justice to the Boiled Mutton awaiting us. As usual after a mail, papers scattered everywhere. The sanitary section are busy disinfecting and sterilising our blankets. A big number of Reinforcements came in today for the 57th and 58th B.\n","163":"\n\nOn picquet with Bricky Mason and McKinlay. Voluntary Church Parade at 6.15. No duties and no parades, so wrote to Lill and sent a few more pictures. Also wrote Mother and France.\n\nEaster, Sat.22 \n\nOn the dug out again, when our party arrived we discovered the Infantry on the, so \"the more the merrier\". We took turns about, and got on real well. In the afternoon I printed some pictures.

We miss the bands of the 30th and 29th Batt. and shall be glad to be with them again. Mother’s letter was from Sydney where she is evidently enjoying herself with Lill and Nell. \nI wrote a long letter to Lill\n and enclosed a good bunch of snaps taken in Ismalia. Doherty is away in Cairo, on leave.\n\nMonday 24th\n\nBuilding dug out at Sphinx Post arrived back in camp about 12.30. Wrote to France to congratulate on passing Exam.\n","167":" Anzac Day.\n\nGeneral Holiday in all the Camps, Church Parade at 7.30, after that we had the day off for sports, etc. it was too bloomin’ hot to do anything until about 3 p.m. when the sports commenced. The first item was the potato race, which was won by \"Mulga\" Bill after a hard struggle. Sack race was won by \"Bilsy\" May, Relay race was\n\nwon by Mason, May, Lancaster, Wright. 75 yds. Officers race Winners- Maj. Williams, N.C.O.’s race, winner Sid Royall, At 5.30 we sat down to a scrumptuous tea, Tinned Salmon tinned fruits, Biscuits, Tinned milk etc. A great \"blow out\" it was after tea we had a real ding-dong concert, in which everyone joined. There was a prize of 20 disastors for the worst singer this was won by \"Glaxo\" The boy Hero. Anyone who was called on had to either render an item, or forfeit 5 disastors, Very few paid the forfeit, and we had a most enjoyable evening. Even Capt. \n\nIrving obliged with a song, and the \"one and only \"Hustler\" gave a good recitation. After supper we had cocoa and biscuits and the singing of the National Anthem brought a very pleasant day to a close.\n","168":"\n\nOut to Hog’s Back Hill again for more sandbagging. I was on Cook’s fatigue so luckily was left in camp. Capt. Lind went down to Rail Head, Capt. Nance took his place with B. Section.\n","169":"\n\nOn swimming parade to Ferry Post. We took about 40 minutes to walk to rail Head, then we got the train and went into Ferry Post, and to the Cabal and didn’t we just enjoy a good swim. Some of the crowd went into Ismalia,, but as my cheque was somewhat weak, I stayed behind and had lunch at the Canteen, which consisted of Tinned Sausages, and Tinned Fruits. We got back to camp about 4.30, tired but happy.\n","170":" \n\nOn light duty around the camp. Yesterday we got news that the Turks were going to attack, but they haven’t done so yet.

Strolled round the town made a few purchases and had dinner which was a jolly good change. It was a treat to walk around the shady streets, after being stuck out in the desert so long. We got back to Camp at tea time, of course the rest of the crowd just returned from Sphinx. \nGot a long letter from Cis. wrote in return.\n","175":"\n\nOn fatigue duty around the camp. Tom Davies and I were sent out about 3 miles in the Desert to bring in some Iron work off the stone boxes left behind by camel trains. In the evening Capt. Nance gave us a lecture on \"the composition of a division\" but \nhe\n knew less about it than \nwe\n did. Then he took us for a stroll up Hog’s Back Hill and told funny stories.\n","176":" \n\nYesterday it was posted up about Gen.Townshends party surrendering in Mesopatania. Things are getting worse than ever. This morning Capt. Irving informed us that there was a big body of Turks near the outpost, but we took it as a big joke.

Fall in at 6.15 stretcher drill and practising loading the patients on camels and in the sand carts. I would not care to be badly wounded and brought in on a camel, as they give a man a rough ride.\n","181":" \n\nOn Picquet. Crowd went for Route March. Wrote some good long letters and had a bath. Great activity in and around the trenches. Motor Lorries dashing by loaded with materials for trench making. Several more Batts. came in and some big guns, so if the Turks comes he’ll get a good reception.\n","182":" \n\nHad a lecture by Capt. Nance, and jolly interesting it was too. Also had some practise in bandaging, first for a long time. Bilsy May’s Birthday, we had a \"beano\" for tea to celebrate it.

Section since we have been in Egypt Bricky Mason is the proud father of a Newcastle \"Walad\"\n","183":"\n\nOn Sanitary Police with Jimmy Woods last night Capt. Irving took a party out to Sphinx Post, to finish the Dressing Station. Under the able supervision of \"Mr.\" Jackson they soon had it finished and the roof on. They made a splendid job of it (I don’t think) during the night, while they were peacefully slumbering, a terrific crash was heard ----- the roof had fallen in. So next morning they had to turn to and rebuild it. They got back in camp just before dinner, being Thursday we had afternoon off.\n","184":" \n\nWent about half a mile away from camp and put in pegs for 2 tents and built latrines, or rather started to do so when we got word to say that\n\n36.\n\n37 more patients had arrived, so we just had to return to camp and pitch another Tortoise tent there. A supply of Red X comforts came in so we had tinned salmon and condensed milk for dinner, also got some good cigarettes \n","185":" \n\nGot news to\n\npack up all our gear and get ready to move off to Ferry Post. \nFinished off long letter to Lill and posted it.\n It might be the last chance I’ll get for some time. It’s awfully hot it will be a pleasant change to get to a cooler climate. Got orders about 6 p.m. just after tea, to pack up all our gear and move away at once. So we had to turn to and take down all the tents and load them on the waggons, besides all the stores from the G.M. Then we dismantled the latrines and set fire to them, put all the stuff that was not required on the incinerator and left the ground quite clear, by this time it was mid-night. We then had some tea and a smoke and put all our gear on and left Hog’s Back Hill at about 1 a.m. The waggons all were well loaded, and only had 2 horse teams instead of 4, and as they kept getting stuck in the loose sand, Maj. Williams told off a number to each waggon to give the horses a hand with their loads. We were all a bit tired after about 6 hours solid work and to have to harness ourselves to waggons but us all in anything but a good humour, but of course, there was only one thing to do.\n\nMoonlight flit from \"Hog’s Back\"\n\nThe distance from Hog’s Back to Ferry Post, our destination, was about 10 or 11 miles, and jolly long miles they were. Every few minutes we had to \"pull up\" and spell the horses as it was such heavy \"going\" the night was very sultry and the sweat flowed very freely. After passing \"rail Head\", the road got better, and we moved along a bit quicker. I hung onto a wagon and fell asleep several times, I was so \"knocked up\" but I’d bump against the wheel and wake up with a start. Just before we started Bert Evans, one of our transport men got thrown from his horse and injured his back, so he was brought along as a patient. We got into Ferry Post about 5, on Sunday morning. We flung off out kits, grabbed our blankets and slept until about 10 a.m. when the sun and flies woke us up. Then we turned out and searched around for water, in which \n\nto wash both the inner and outer man. This is a very dusty part of the desert, and the sooner we get out of it the better we shall all be pleased. About 2 p.m. we had a swim in the canal and how did we enjoy it. We had stew for Tea, which was real good.\n","186":" \n\nReveille at 5 a.m. First parade 6.15 Our new C.

Breakfast at 4.30 The Cooks have to turn out at 12 to cook it and we had some squad drill this morning, but it’s such a long time since we had any that when we came to \"form line\" we got tied in a knot. Capt. Irving has been transferred to C. Section. We have Capt. Mollison, whom we are not sed to \"yet\" He tells us that he is going to be even more strict than the \"Big Roan\", so B section had better \"look out\" 6 of us including \"Turfee\" May went out to Hog’s Back Camp and filled in the holes that we left open. We took out \n\nsome tinned fruit with us in the waggon and had tea before we started out. We \"tore\" into it and got finished just on 8 o’clock. Capt. Nance gave Trousdale 50 disasters to buy beer with for the crowd, but when we got to the Canteen they were sold out, so we had to fall back on the Y.MC.A. where we got a drink of Lime Juice. We got back in camp about 9.30. \n","189":"\n\nOn cooks fatigue. There are nearly 300 of us in camp now, and there is plenty of work to do. Breakfast at 4.30 which made a jolly long day of it. Breakfast at 4.30 which made a jolly long day of it. Bill’s May and \"Snowy\" Hargreaves were also on C.F. with me. Things went off well till after tea, when the water got turned off, and did not come on again till nearly 9. which kept us working till nearly 10 o’clock, we then cooked a few chops and went to bed.\n","190":"\n\nLast night A Section got orders to prepare for a Field Day with the 5th Division, but it was cancelled during the night. McDougall and I on Sanitary Police, another hot day. 115 degrees in the shade, and the water has been off nearly all the bloomin’ day. Nuggett Bennett returned from Alexandra.\n","191":"\n\nMcDougall and I on Sanitary Police. It is not such a good job here as it was in Serapeum, as have no niggers to do the work, but have to \"turn to\" ourselves. Snowy Hargreaves gave me some gaslight papers and we printed a few good copies, which will be very nice to send home.\n\nSaturday 20th\n\nBig Mail came in I got 4 letters from Lill and one from Mother, so now I’ll be able to finish off my letters. Lill also sent me a snapshot taken in the Gardens with Mrs. B. and the dog. It is a beauty. To-day we were issued with Brushes to clean the buttons on our tunics and our boots and leggings.\n\n38.\n","192":"\n","193":" \n\nChurch Parade off, as we had no officers to take us. Gen. McCay inspected us, we had a full dress rehearsal in the morning. All our boots and leggings were shewed up the first time for a long while. The \"dinkum\" inspection came off at 5 p.m we were all lined up in review order, even our camel corps were in full marching order, with their humps dressed by the right. The General dashed up just after 5. and made a thorough inspection of everything. What he thought of us, we’ll hear later. \n\nI finished off my letters to L. and M. and set 20 snapshots to L. in letter No.2. Also wrote to France and sent a couple of snaps. Gen. McCay inspected us. We all turned out in our best clothes, buckles polished and got up to kill. He was delighted with our turnout, and said he didn’t think he had such a fine body of men in his division. Old Shepherd was very pleased about it. The final event was Capt. Wooster’s horse bolting back to the stables with him. Good Lord, I’ve written this before.\n","194":"\n\nToday we gave in our leggings, belts, and water bottles and were issued with infantry packs, then we spent the rest of the day in packing up our belongings in readiness to move off at a minutes notice. \"Bluey Riley\" got a parcel today, so now we have some decent tobacco to smoke.\n","195":"\n\nWrote letter No.2 to L, and sent 16 more snaps. Paraded this morning\n\nwith our packs up. Things are very rough in this camp. I think its about the worst bloomin’ part of the Desert we’ve been in.\n\nWednesday 24th\n\nThis is Empire Day and we didn’t even have a special parade to celebrate it. \"Maud\" Newell gave us a bit of instruction in how to fix the Gas helmets They are made of flannel, with glass for the eyes, are saturated with chemical. Newell had us lined up and timed us to see how long to fix ‘em on, and marvellous to relate, Bricky Howard Won.\n\nThursday 25th \n\nDivisional Review by Gen.McCay the 8th made an awful showing, quite the worst turn out since the 8th had been the","196":"\n\nYesterday I wrote to L asking her to forward L.S.D. This morning, on parade, the Col. informed us that we go to Moaska onSunday,","197":" to entrain for \"somewhere\" Hooray. \"Billsy\" May’s ears are flapping with excitement. The mail closes today at 12 for an indefinite period, so its \"hurry up and drop a few lines home, so that they won’t worry over us not writing. At 4.30 we fell in again and marched down to the Review Ground, where we were inspected by Gen. Godley. It was a most inspiring sight, what little \n\n39.\n\nwe could see of it. At intervals, anti-aircraft guns were posted in case an aeroplane put in an appearance. As the General was passing our crowd he said \"ah, very good indeed and well equipped too\" and it set us wondering whether he was alluding to us or not. The march past was a bit better than the morning rehearsal, but could easily have been better.\n","198":" \n\nKept jolly busy burning off superfluous stuff so as to be clear when we have to move.\n\nThis morning it was read out on Parade, that Gen. Godley was greatly impressed by the 5th Division, and that he was very sorry to lose such a fine body of men, but \"Eqypt’s loss is France’s gain\"; which all sounds very nice. It is heartbreaking to see some of the stuff that is getting burnt, but we can’t carry too much about with us and so the poor old Sanitary Police are kept busy. \n","199":" \n\nStill burning off. Tons of stuff getting dumped. By jove, it’s easily understood how a war costs millions, Mac Dougall, and I went down for a swim in the canal, which was very enjoyable after having been working in the bloomin’ incinerator all day. Capt. Wooster told Mac and I that we were to stay behind to hand the camp over to the Welsh Division who are taking our places.\n\nSunday, May 28th. \n\nReveille at 3.30 Breakfast at 4, Rolled our blankets and loaded them on to waggons. The crowd marched away with packs up (for the first time) at 5.15 and right well they looked. There were 5 of us left behind with Capt. Woodster, Cosier, Matthews, Mac and myself and Harry Doutch. An advance party of R.A.M.C. came into camp last night. We straightened up all the tents and got the stuff burning nicely when the Sanitary squad corporal arrived on the scene with 20 niggers. We set the niggers on cleaning out the incinerator and scrubbing out the cookhouse then they took clean sand and scattered it all round the cookhouse and we left everything in tip top condition. We had everything finished by 9 o’clock then we had some breakfast. Beef Tea and cocoa, then we all had a shave and a wash and loaded up our packs. Capt Wooster told us that we could do as we liked the rest of the day and gave us a pass for Ismalia. \n\nWe put our packs on a waggon which took them as far as the park in Ismalia. This is a pretty little town, big shady trees everywhere, and the gardens are very pretty. We sat down near the pond in the gardens, in which fish were swimming around. We took off our packs and boots and had a glorious loaf for an hour or so. It was a very pleasant change after having been stuck out in the desert so long. Then Mac and I went into town and bought some tinned fruit and biscuits and lemonade and then we had a jolly good feed. Mac and I had a glass of nice cold beer, which went down well. After we had finished dinner we rolled over and had another sleep. About half past 3 we had a wash under a tap in the gardens and put on \n","200":"\n\n our packs again ready for the march into our camp at Moaska. Just before we came away we were joined by an Indian who stayed a whole and had a yarn. We walked through the town on our way to camp, but it was very quiet. We met a young officer walking along with rather a good looking nurse, Cosier sung out \"eyes right\" and saluted him. They knew we only did it for a joke, as they laughed about it, and enjoyed it as much as we did. We got into Camp at about 5, just in time for tea. The tents were pitched, which was a jolly good job, and after tea we were not long out of bed and I slept as sound as a rock, after a very rough busy day.\n","201":"\n\nFor S.P. again. We built up an old incinerator with the assistance of an Arab bricklayer, and started the old game going again. The 29th Band is playing just outside our tent. If there is one thing that makes soldiering worth while, it is to march behind a good band playing a stirring tune. Then you see the chaps chests swell out like pouter pigeons. \n\nThe crowd went for a route march to night with full packs up, but I know one man who went out with an air cushion in his pack. S.P. were excused, so the game is still good. \n","202":" \n\nAnother busy day in the incinerator, also digging holes to bury what wont burn, a nigger came along and was very anxious to dig the hole, so, as we did not like to spoil a good mind, we let him. The tucker we are getting is rotten, Our Corp.Cook was at Alexandria for about 6 weeks at a Cookery School, but instead of improving he has got a jolly sight worse. This is a rotten camp, we are in, but thank the Lord we’ll soon be out of it, at least we are hoping so. The crowd went for another route march with full packs. The orderly room sergeant informed us that they were open to receive letters again, which is a jolly good job, as we all like letting folks at home know how we are. Went to Y.M.C.A. where a first class programme was gone through by the New Zealanders from the stationary Hospital, who are leaving for France about the same time as we hope to. This afternoon I went for a stroll as far as Nefiche station. It appeared deserted but for a few Arabs who were lying about asleep. As soon as a train was heard it became quite exciting. Arabs old and young \"Bints\" and \"Walads\" appeared from \"Nowhere\" and every one had something for sale,, cigarettes, chocolates, melons, cucumber etc. etc., \"Cigaretts very good\", \"very nice\" \"very clean \"Water Melon, Johnnie\" They were singing out and made a regular pandemonium. They are a very dirty crowd and spend most of these time hunting \"big game\" Things must be pretty bad with \"em about these parts, as they dug a deep hole for us just to let ‘em take away the scraps of food.\n","203":"\n\nThis morning we had \na steak for breakfast\n. At least that is what the cooks called it, and as there was not sufficient to say what it was by taste, we shall have to let it go that we \ndid\n really have steak for breakfast. Of course we all growled about it, and some of the growls reached the ears of the Orderly Officer who came around to see what was the cause of all the growling, but with the \"real thorough-ness\" which is peculiar to the \"British Army Officer, instead of getting at the seat of the trouble, and letting the owners of the \"aforesaid, \nsteak\n explain things, he inclined his ear to our very able acting Q.M. who propounded a very interesting story, and our gallant orderly officer, went away quite satisfied that the privates would growl even if they had a menu to chose from like patrons of the \"Hotel Cecil\". This morning I printed a couple of pictures with Payne’s outfit. These are the last I’ll get as all cameras are called in. \"Lizzie\" Payne and \"Her\" partner Miles Sheehan are jolly good camera friends \"(I don’t think) Miles took Paynes picture, Payne printed a copy this morning and he calls it \"The Prince of Wales in Egypt.\" \n","204":" \n\nMore kit inspection we had to give one of our Blankets in to.day so let us hope it wont be cold tonight. Peter came in to see me and we had a good old yarn, Our Incinerator is kept going merrily burning old clothes. We gave the Helmets in and got our felt hats back.\n","205":" \n\nPosted letter No.3 to Lill.\n I wonder when we shall be able to write again. Soon I hope. Short arm and foot inspection. They took more clothes away from this morning, so now all we have left is what we stand up in. The tents are coming down tomorrow. We are living closer to nature every day.\n","206":"\n\nWashed my drill pants had a bath. The waggons are all packed ready to move off. \"Murph\" paid me a visit this morning. He is looking very well. Our tents all came down this morning now we are camped in a big Mess Hut, which is very cool. Mail came in, I got 4 letters 3 from Lill and 1 from Nell, also 2 table talks from France, which were very welcome. \n","207":"\n\nWrote letter No. 4 to Lill. Very hot day. Sand storm got up after tea and smothered everything in dust. There is a big water tank up the road a bit and today it overflowed, we rushed up under it and had a glorious shower.\n","208":" \n\nScrubbed my tunic and put my few things together ready for the great day, when we say \"Goodbye for ever\" to this fly and flea infested land called Egypt. The Egyptian Mail\" contained news of a Big Naval Battle in the North Sea. Must have been a lively scrap while it lasted. Reveille at 4.30 Then all hands hard at work clearing up the camp for inspection by the G.O.C. Breakfast at 5 at 6.30 we all fell in, S.Ps, Cooks fatigue and picquet with full packs up, Gen. Tivey and C.O.C and A.D.M.S. arrived just after they inspected us. After it was over the Col. informed us that the Gen.Said \"It was the best show he’d seen in Egypt\". Then the Col. thanked us for making such a good show and we were dismissed. Just as we were settling down in the Mess Hut, the orderly Sergeant broke the news to us that we had to get rid of the mats, on which we have been sleeping the past week. Now we have to sleep on the bare ground with only one blanket, just to show the Col’s appreciation. \n","209":"\n\nThis is the great day we have been looking forward to for a long time, being the date we were to leave Egypt, but yesterday (curse it) we were informed that our departure was postponed indefinitely. \n\nLast night some of the Canteen Proprietors had some bad luck. 2 fellows sleeping next to me had some very \nnice present given to them\n ……..

The crowd went for Route march, with packs up S.P. very busy making grease traps and improvements to latrines. \n\nThursday 8th \n\nThis morning the \"Egyptian Mail\" published news of Lord Kitcheners’ death, and is of course the chief topic of conversation. I went into Nefiche and had a look round the village. It is a very squalid looking hole and all the natives are very dirty. Everyone of them has something for sale, cigarettes, tinned fruit cocoanuts etc., for which they ask exorbitant prices. There is a guard of West Indian Troops on the bridge and they stopped us from going into the village proper. After lunch we held a meeting to appoint a committee to arrange tings for the Divisonal Sports to be held next Tuesday, so the Lord only knows when we are going to leave Egypt.\n","211":" \n\n\"Try outs\" for Div.

Sports were to have \"come off today\" but we had a very impressive memorial service to Lord Kitchener, and sports postponed till tomorrow at 5.40 the service was held. The whole brigade marched on to the Parade ground and the 29th Batt. band played the Hymn music. The drum was muffled and draped. The chaplain spoke a short address and said what a great loss the Army had suffered. Then we sang \"Nearer My God To Thee\", \"Lead Kindly Light\" \"For Those in Peril on the Sea\" and 3 of our most beautiful hymns. They sounded very fine, sung by 4 thousand off lusty throats; to the accompaniment of the band. At the close of the service the Brigade Major roared out \"Parade. Shun\" and then every man stood as steady as a rock while the band played the \"Dead March \"In Saul\" and the bugle blew the \"Last Post\" Just as the last notes died away, the sun \nfaded out of sight and another day ended.\n\nOur Athletes have been training hard for the last few days, and we are looking forward to them making a name of themselves tomorrow.

Marched into our old camp with their \"Circus\" Bands we have our packs ready and gear all ready to move off at a minutes notice. Issued with Emergency Rations and waiting for the word \"GO\". The cookhouse are dismantled and their gear packed, so we have to exist on bully beef and bread and jam. Fell in about 6.30 for roll call and inspection. Then we had a drink of tea. This tea caused quite a lot of rude remarks to be passed. Capt. Wooster went to a lot of trouble to obtain sugar for the tea, but the cooks \"lost it\" After a lot of fooling around we marched to the station and got aboard the open trucks which were to take us to Alexandria. We left Moaska about 11 p.m. It was a glorious night and warm \n\nand the open trucks were much more pleasant than the closed in carriages would have been. We took our coats from our packs and rolling them around us dropped off to sleep. \n\nSaturday 17th \n\nThe sun rose about 3 and we woke up and gazed on the land we were leaving. It was looking real well too. All the land around was under cultivation and the crops were looking well. The natives get to work early. They were busy gathering their crops and taking them to market, loaded on camels and donkeys. The girls and women were kept busy drawing water. We saw some fine looking girls tripping along with water jars on their heads. The Arabs on these outlying farms are much superior to the crowd that hang around our camps. We arrived in Alexandria at about 5 a.m. The natives met us with chocolates and cigarettes, as usual, and a new stunt they had changing money, which must have been a god thing for them. We went aboard the \"Transylvania\" at about 9. She is a fine big boat, but has a very bad name among the troops as a \"starvation ship\" There are about 3,000 of us aboard. And there is not too much room. We are all issued with Life Belts which have to be worn all day and slept in at night. Tea was the first meal we had aboard. It consisted of bread and butter. Not very \"scrumptious\" but a pleasant change from Bully Beef and Biscuits, and tea to drink. It was so hot and stuffy down below that we was allowed to put our blankets on the promenade deck. Last post was blown at 7.30 and \"lights out\" at 8. No smoking after tea is the hardest part. But, of course its better to do without a smoke than strike a match and attract a bloomin’ hun submarine. Alexandria is a fine town, what we saw of it. The Harbor is full of shipping of all kinds. There are scores of yachts and little boats flying round. It puts one in mind of dear old Sydney. We soon got to sleep as we were tired out after our train journey.\n\nSunday 18th\n\nReveille at 5.30 it was very pleasant to wake up and smell the sea air once again. I hopped out and had a salt water bath, which was just great, being such a huge crowd, we have our meals in 3 sittings. We were last and had breakfast at 8.30 Jolly poor Break, it was lumpy porridge, bread and very little butter, and coffee. Everyone is very glad this trip is only a 5 days one We left Alexandria at 9 a.m. The Band played a lively tune, and as the tugs hauled out, we had a farewell glimpse of Egypt. I don’t think any of us are sad to leave, although we have had some good times there. I am sitting on deck writing this. There are guards posted all over the places on the look out for submarines. The 8th are \"at last\" embarked on the \"Great Adventure\" I wonder what they are doing home about now.\n\nMonday 19th\n\nHopped out of Bunk at 5.30, rolled my blanket and had a hot salt water bath. Today we take 2nd sitting potatoes and for \ntea\nBread, butter and a \nlittle\n jam. \nBreakfast today.\n coffee 2 eggs bread and butter. \nDinner\n same as yesterday. The weather is glorious, and the ship hardly rolls at all. A wicked looking destroyer showed up this morning and is keeping us company. She keeps Zig-zagging in front of us evidently on the outlook for mines or submarines; and makes us feel a bit more comfortable. We had some practice this morning in putting on Gas Helmets. I don’t think anyone is sick, as they always muster at meal times and the arrival of the orderlies with the tucker is greeted with loud cheers. A big wave came through the porthole at breakfast time and soaked us few who were seated near. The crowd are all in good humour and laugh at everything. I must see if I cant write home, or \nsomeone\nwill be getting wild.\n\nTuesday 20th\n\nWeather continues good. The T.B.D. still keeps us company. She keeps dodging across our bows like a porpoise. Breakfast was rough again, butter barely in evidence. Dinner was fairly good, Corned Beef Haricot Beans, and potatoes in their jackets. We had more practise in fixing on Gas Helmets. Capt. Wooster told us this morning about the 1st and 2nd Division getting cut up, and also informed us that we should soon be in among the fun. We take first sitting today’s meals. At tea time, we went down for our tea to find the guard at first sitting, which caused some more rude remarks. The poor old","219":" had to take last sitting instead of","220":" The deck was overcrowded, so I camped in the Music room.\n","221":"\n\nIt is quite amusing to watch the antics of our destroyer escort. As soon as a ship appears in sight she hops away to make engines, just like a little dog run away to sniff at another little dog. When she has found out her business back she comes again. This afternoon we were inspected by the G.O.C. \nWrote to Lill\n, Mother, and France.\n","222":"\n\nDiscarded our summer clothing and paraded for inspection in our service uniforms. Passed a French Boat at anchor, her engine had broken down. Out destroyer went over and had a sniff, just to see things were alright.\n","223":"\n\nArrived outside Marseilles early this morning. It was very misty and we hung about for a long time awaiting the Pilot. There were plenty of fishing boats around. About 5.30 a fussy little launch put in an appearance and brought our pilot along. Then the thing \n\nwe have been looking forward to so long, happened, we steamed slowly ahead to France. Passing along between the rocky land on either side the city of Marseilles came, slowly into view. Wharves in every direction and ships of every nationality loading and unloading their cargoes. Just near where we tied up a party of German prisoners were at work, under an armed guard. They were loading trucks with rails, and seemed to be on good terms with the French Officer in charge. A number of French girls came around the boat playing melodeons and singing and they reaped a rich harvest of coins. We came ashore about 4 and hung about till 4.30 then we marched through the town to the station. The French people made s feel almost as though we were home, they waved their hats and handkerchief and gave us a most cheering welcome. We got aboard the train and left Marseilles at about 5.30. The country we passed through was a surprise to us all. To try and describe it would be wasting time. The beautiful gum trees and grass, the red poppies, the yellow, blue and purple flowers, the fine structure of the bridges over the beautiful rivers the magnificent residences of the wealthy, the pretty creepers covered cottages of the workers, with their neatly laid out gardens, in which peas, beans, and potatoes and some fine beds of strawberries were growing, the fields of grass with fat, lazy cows grazing and looking very contented, and the girls and women folk they were the biggest surprise of the lot. Their dainty way of speaking, and the neat way of dress, their pleasant smiles, in fact everything about the country & the women-folk fully explains why the Frenchmen are such great fighters.\n\n The very idea of the \"Huns\" or anyone daring to \"play up\" in a country like this seems almost a sacrilege. We have all heard a lot about France, but it is far more beautiful than any of us ever dreamed. There were 8 of us in each carriage. Oru crowd consisted of MacDougall, Payney, Frank Woods, Aldis, \"Miles\" Sheehaw, Bert Hunt, Stan Wright, and Myself. The carriages were not too good, but far more comfortable than the stinking boxes we rode in, in Egypt. We looked out of the windows as long as we could. It did not get dark till about 10 then we unrolled our blankets and tried to sleep, but very few of us had much sleep; as the floor was too jolly hard.\n","224":"\n\nWe were all awake about 5, when we tried to get a wash in our mess tins, it freshened us up, anyhow. Then we chewed some bully beef and biscuits and said we’d had breakfast. Then we continued to feast our eyes on the glorious country through which we were steaming. At intervals of a few hundred yards the French soldiers are posted, guarding the Railways, also on all the Bridges and crossings. They all seemed to be men about 40 & 50 Their uniforms of blue and grey and some wearing scarlet pants, looked very quaint to us, after being used to nothing but Khaki. We greeted them all with hearty cheers, and threw them cigarettes and tobacco of which we had a good supply. When we pulled up at a station the kids all rushed up and begged for \"souvenirs\" badges off our hats or coats, or coins and they seemed quite delighted even with a tin of corned beef. It is hard to realise that this country is at war, as all the people look so happy and content but we can’t help noticing the absence of men and the number of people in mourning. \n\nAbout half past ten we pulled up at a big station. Here we were issued with Tea Rations, Wrighty Aldis, and I walked along to the platform where we discovered a buffet, where one could buy almost anything. Bread, Chocolate, Tobacco, Cakes wine, beer etc., We bought some Bread and cakes and had a glass of wine or two, and also took a couple of bottles of wine back to the carriage, where we had a most enjoyable feed. Then we had a sing-song, and everyone in the carriage had to render an item or forfeit a bottle of wine. I unfortunately was broke and had to \nsing\n. The most enjoyable items on the programme were rendered by Mac and Wrighty, who each produced a bottle of wine, for which they were loudly cheered. \"Miles\" made a speech which drew forth much applause and cries of \"sit down\", Lizzie Payne rendered a rag time ditty with a stirring chorus, \"Son\" Aldis gave us \"Mother Machree\" in his most touching manner. Bert Hunt also sang, and acted the part of the chairman very admirably. The valley of the Rhone is very beautiful and every man had his head out of the windows all day long, as it was too good to miss even the smallest bit of it. We passed a station named \nOrange\n, which put us all in mind of \"New South\" Then we passed \nVienne\n and pulled up outside \nLyons\n Stations, right in the town. A crowd of kiddies and girls soon collected, and those who were lucky enough to be able to speak French, yarned with the girls the rest of us amused ourselves by throwing pennies to the \"walads\" and enjoyed watching them scramble. These French Girls are very nice, everything about them seems to dainty and the way they speak makes a man almost wish he was a Frenchman, especially after being among the Arabs for so long. \nVillefranch\n we next passed through, and then on to Dijon which \n\nis famous for its roses. Here some Red x. nurses gave us tea and also pinned favors in our tunics. It is quite light although it is past 10 o’clock. \nLa Roche\n was the last station I remember passing before going to sleep A big junction a Hospital Train, with its beautiful fittings and pleasant faced nurses passed. It almost makes a man wish he was wounded, so as to be able to take a ride in it.\n","225":"\n\nNo bloomin’ Church Parade today, shunted off the line at \nJuvisey\n. Passed \nVersailles\n where we got a glimpse of the beautiful palace of Napoleon, set amidst a mass of foliage and surrounded by statuary. \nParis\n is visible in the distance. \nEiffel Tower\n showing up about everything. Passed \nSt. Germaine\n and \nConfians\n stopped some time at \nCreil\n. Saw big guns ready for moving to the front, also passed a huge bakery, worked by French Soldiers. French girls threw kisses and we cheered, then they threw flowers and someone commence to sing \"Australia will be there\" which was taken up by the whole train load, and a fine bloomin’ row they made. Passed \nAmiens\n \n\nSaw the beautiful cathedral. Passed through some very long tunnels and arrived at \nAbbeville\n about 7.30, very pretty town. We have been in the train about 52 hours,, and I haven’t heard one man growl. Passed through \nBoulogne\n just as it was getting dark, then on to \nEtaples\n and \n Calais\n finally arriving at \nMorbecque.\n We were told at \nEtaples\n not to unroll our blankets as we may disentrain at any minute, but as it got towards midnight we got the shivers, and were soon inside our blankets and asleep. We reached \nMorbecque\n about 4 a.m. where the train pulled up with a terrific bump, which woke us all up. There was all excitement getting our packs loaded up.\n","226":"\n\nOur First Anniversary.\n A French officer met us all at the station and conducted us to our billet. We have about a dozen huts for our Amb. They are built in a nice little paddock next to the kiddies school, and quite near a Church. There is a pond close by, which supplies us with water for washing, but it is not good drinking water. We are only a few miles from the firing line, and can hear the big guns quite distinctly. It did not take us long to unroll our blankets and get to sleep, as we had been nearly 3 days on the train, and had very little sleep. We woke up again about 11, and after a drink of tea and a snack we were told off in a fatigue parties to square up the camp, and build latrines, etc., Mac Dougall and I were told off as S.P. again, so the game is still good. We got leave when the work was done, and wandered around the village. It is only a small place, but every little thing about it is historical. The French people are most obliging, nothing is too much trouble to them. It is very nice to talk to those who can speak English, as the French accent makes one dry old lingo which sounds quite pleasant. The town is full of soldiers, Aust. N.Zealanders, Tommies, Scotchmen, in their kilts, in fact, all sorts, but they are all very well behaved. Everything is very cheap,, we only have to pay about a penny here, for what those sobbing Egyptians would charge 6d. A party of us went around the place and spent a most enjoyable evening. There were 6 of us in the party and it seemed strange to be able to \"shout\" for the lot with only 6 pence. There are a big number of wine and beer shops about, which did good business, but I’ve only seen 1 man drunk. They don’t have to pay for licences and anyone can open a shop, the only restriction being a matter of hours. They are allowed to open from 11 till 1 and from 6 till 8 in the evening. \n\nReveille was at 6, but we were all awake long before, Thanks to the big guns. They make a terrific noise, it is hard to realise that we are so near the fighting line. While on parade we can hear the kiddies saying their lessons, and in the paddock a woman milking the cows, and just a few miles away, there are hundreds of thousands of men doing their best to kill each other. One of our sergts. has a monkey and our picquets are kept busy stopping the big crowds of kids from overrunning the place, who come to see it. Poor old Jenny, this cold climate doesn’t agree with her, and I’m afraid she’ll soon leave us. We had breakfast at 7, B.B.& B. and Tea. Parade at 9 and another parade at 2 (today 12 months ago, I was single up till 6 p.m. Then I joined the Benedicts (and lived happy ever after) Mac K. Mac.D Wrighty Alldis, \"Miles\" and I celebrated the auspicious occasion in the good old fashion way. \n","227":"\n\nBusy day, building latrines and cutting paths through the grass, and repairing the huts, some of which leaked very badly. When we arrived at Marseilles we got a few letters of an old mail. \nI got 2 letters\n from France and a bundle of very welcome papers. It has been raining nearly all day, and there is mud everywhere. But we all prefer France with its mud to Egypt with its sunshine and sand. It is very interesting to hear these French kiddies accounts of when the Buns were here and when they tell of Germans getting captured or falling into traps, their eyes sparkle and they laugh as though iti was a huge joke. Whilst travelling in the train we slowed down at many stations and got off to fill our water bottles and other odd jobs. The conveniences are marked Hommes (men and Dames women) Payney on catching sight \n\nof the notice for the first time said \"Hommes, there was heavy fighting there, I read in the \"paper\" Now it is classed among our Ambs. Jokes.) The S.P. were kept busy squaring up the camps. Capt Irving and party arrived with the horses. We leave after tea and went down town, where the A.S.C. Band was playing. There is a fine old Church in town which I must pay a visit before we leave.\n","228":"\n\nStill raining. Very muddy. Our hut kept dry last night, thanks to our repairs. We had \"Sop\" for Breakfast, Biscuits soaked in tinned milk and Hot water, which wasn’t too bad. For dinner we had tinned meat and vegetables which was very nice and a very pleasant change. This afternoon the crowd went for Route March with packs up. The rain cleared away after dinner and made things quite pleasant. Mac & I paid a visit to our friend \"Madame\" and had some of her very excellent wine.\n","229":"\n\nSmall mail arrived. Got letter from Aunt Nell, Mac & Wrighty and I had look through Morbeque Church. We climbed right up the rickety old stairs to the clock where we got a good view of the surrounding country. It is a very interesting old church and some of the tombstones date back hundreds of years. In the churchyard is an old headstone with the \"Legion of Honor\" Order let in. We then went on to Hazelbrouck, a very old town about 4 miles away. There are some fine shops there. The Hall of Justice is a big rambling old building. We went into a Café and had a feed. Grilled steak and chipped potatoes, for which we paid 1 franc and 3d for a glass of English beer. On our way back we saw a big number of aeroplanes away over. They were evidently Germans, as we could see the shells busting quite distinctly. The rain has cleared away and the weather is just perfect. No one goes to bed early as it does not get dark till about half – past ten and we cant go to sleep.\n","230":"\n\nWrote to Lill. France No.1.\n Stretcher drill. B. Section were on their worst behaviour today and absolutely refused to drill. Met Peter down town and he, Wrighty and I had a most enjoyable time. The weather has been glorious today. We are getting jolly good food now and ought to regain some of the weight we lost in Egypt. Capt. Lind promoted to Action Major. Mac\" is drawing plans in the orderly room and Wrighty is on S.P. with me.\n","231":"\n\nHeavy bombardment last night. We could hear the boom of the big gun nearly all night. Things are fairly free and easy here and we can go out of camp almost when we like. Got an issue of cigarettes today. 2 pkts. per man. Weather is simply glorious. Went down to the Baths today and had a hot bath. The first one since leaving Melbourne .Yesterday our Amb. played cricket against the N.Zealanders from the D.H.S, and we won by 50 runs. Everybody is broke and tonight Mac.Bert Hunt, Wrighty and I wandered round enjoying the scenery and watching the aeroplanes. \n","232":"\n\nParcel arrived. Glorious sunshining day. Church parade in a big paddock with grass up to our knees. While we were singing hymns we could hear the big guns booming in the distance. The guns were firing all last night and kept us awake. \nPosted letters home to Lill and Mother\n and started writing to France. Got another letter from her today. Had just put my letters in the box when \nI got the \nparcel. It couldn’t have arrived at a better time. We had the cake for tea, and it went down real well, the first we’ve had for months. It is a treat to smoke decent tobacco again, Snowy Atherton also got a parcel so we had quite a banquet today.\n","233":"\n\nThis morning we went through a gas attack, which was very interesting and instructive. We all marched down to a paddock, where an Imperial Officer lectured us on \"Gas Attacks\", and how to wear Gas Helmets\" Then we all put on our helmets and they sent the gas over. They also exploded a number of \"tear bombs, these make tears run. And of course dim the sight.\n","234":"\n\nGot parcel from France\n am doing very well lately. Read out on orders that an A. Section man is appointed \"Bakshee\" Corporal in B. Section. B.Section are quite insulted about it and paraded to \"Maud\" and told him just what they thought, but poor little \"Maud\" is afraid of the Col. so I suppose this is as far as it will go. Still raining\n\nVery heavily. Went for Route March with our new Major, Macartney, who has changed over from the 14th F. Amb, with Major Lind, Mac and I spent a pleasant morning at Madames. Everybody is broke and we are anxiously awaiting the arrival of our pay. Rain cleared off a bit at night, and Mac and I went for a walk and met \"Johnnie Walker\" in an estaminet, and enjoyed his company. \n","235":"\n\nPay arrived at last. We got 25 Francs each, which was marked in our Pay Books 17\/11. What a time the 8th brigade had. Every shop in the village was packed with soldiers, and one had a hard job to purchase anything at all. I have been stoney broke for some time, and to put a cap on things I go and break my bloomin’ pipe and have had to be content with a clay dab, for which I paid a penny. Mac, Wright Bert, Hunt and I visited the estaminets and had some French wine, and also had a good feed. Fried eggs and bread and butter and coffee.\n","236":"\n\nMore rain and plenty of mud, had another good feed of eggs. These French eggs are 3 times the size of Egyptian eggs and one can get a decent feed from 3 or 4 of ‘em. Nothing much doing in camp as its too wet. We got a pleasant surprise today they gave us another 25 francs, so everybody is up to cash now.\n","237":"\n\nFollowing","238":" Water cart\n\nBig mail in today. I got 3 long letters from Lill and 1 from Mother\n also 2 photos from Katoomba. Quite the nicest letters I have ever had. They all look jolly well on the pictures. They are not taking in any mail, so we can’t send away any letters, which is jolly hard luck, as we have \n\n tons of interesting news, but when we come to write we’ve forgotten half of it. Had a good time in town tonight and got surprising news and when we returned to camp. Orders to pack up and be ready to move off early n the morning.\n\nSaturday 8th\n\nPoor old Sanitary Police \"fall in\" for more hard work, cleaning up the camp before we leave, Mac & I got quite a decent sweat up. We left Morbeegue about 10. The townspeople gave us a good send off, and I’m sure they were sorry to see us go, as the 8th Brig. had spent a lot of money in the place. We passed through some very pretty country and a number of small villages. We had a spell for dinner at about 2 in a town, and here we had the sight of our lives, so far, are aeroplane duel, but unfortunately, both ‘planes went out of sight, and we did not see the finish. We were all jolly glad when we reached Estaires, where we billeted for the night in a warehouse, in one of the main streets. It was a great relief to get our packs off, as they got mighty heavy, after travelling a few miles. After tea we had a wash, and took a stroll around the town which is of considerable size. We look through the cathedral, which is very ancient and contains some beautiful wood carving and very fine stained glass windows. There are some fine big shops here, and some of them did good business. We turned into bunk at about 9.30 and slept soundly till about 7 next morning. \n\nSunday 9th\n\nLeft Estaires about it, just as the people were going to Church. It is hard to believe that we are so near the firing line. As people in these towns seem quite normal, they go to Church and drink beer just as though nothing of importance was on at all.\n\nErquingham\n\nAfter leaving Estaires we strung out along the road in small parties, as we were now within range of the German guns, and their aircraft were soaring aloft watching what was going on. We arrived at a small village Erquingham about 4.30 Everything around shows signs of the times. Trees broken off by shell fire, remains of houses and churches, shell holes in the roads and fields at almost every road crossing, there is a small buiding which contains a statue of the Virgin Mary and around this vases filled with fresh flowers. Quite a number of these we saw, that had been blown to pieces. While we were in Egypt it was quite a common remark to hear \"How I’d long to be camped at a Pub\" and here we are in this little French Village, actually camped in an estaminent. From the window we can see the remains of the Church in Armentieres, which is minus its tower. Thanks to the Huns. \n\nTo Day Is Mother’s Birthday","239":" \n\nBelow us is the Bar, where Beer and wine can be obtained at a penny a glass and next to that is the kitchen, where madam, and her assistant, cooks us a good feed, or we can cook it ourselves if we like. There are 35 of us camp at this place and there are only 2 women in it. And the Mob is on their best behaviour,, and if anyone forgets himself and uses strong language, the rest of the crowd are \"down\" on him like a ton of hot bricks. In the Bar Ted Grey is washing up glasses and in the kitchen Harry Dauch and a few others are sitting in the Bar with their legs cocked upon a table, just as though they were running the show, we slept peacefully on a full stomach, in spite of the shells.\n","240":"\n\nHad a good day’s loaf, which we enjoyed to the full I had a bath, which was a great treat. Got up about 7 ad had a good feed of eggs. The rest of the day we spent writng letters and reading and playing cards, about 5, Capt. \"Molly\" came along and told us to get our tings ready to move off. We fell in at about 6. (39 men of B.Section) and after being issued with rations we moved off, to get our first taste of being under fire. Things are getting interesting now. While we were waiting for rations, a shell dropped quite near and made hole in the paddock. We went along the road in parties of 6 with an interval of about 200 yds. between each party, and 3 or 4 paces between each man. Serg. Hughes Roy Knowles, \"Trenchy\", \"Billsy\" May, Ted Sutton and I formed one party. We had gone along the road about a mile, when someone proposed a spell we had only just sat down and taken off our packs, when \"plonk\" came a shell just over the hedge alongside us. Leaves and mud scattered everywhere and so did we, quick and lively. This was our first taste of being \"underfire\" and it gave one a nasty taste in the mouth. We soon had our packs on again and went for our lives, and were very glad then we reached our Dressing Station. It was a Brewery at one time, but there’s just about enough of it left to make a r3 roomed cottage, the rest of it lies scattered around the atmosphere. The Dressing Station is down in the cellar, which is very strongly built, and looks able to stand anything. We had no sooner arrived than 8 volunteers were called for to go out to the trenches. There was no trouble in getting ‘em, as everyone wanted to go, we went out in 2 parties of 4 each, MacDougal, \"Blue\" Stanton, Trenchy and Deed, and Butler \"Bricky\" Howard, Hancock and myself. It is about 2 miles to the R.A.P. from our station, we took out a contrivance mounted on wheels to push our stretchers along on. \n","241":"\n\nThe Trenches are well built, and a man is fairly safe in ‘em, as long as a big shell doesn’t lob inside. The dressing station in the trenches is quite snug, but the dug-outs for the stretcher bearers are rather too damp to be comfortable Bricky and I soon \"turned in\" after having a look round, but we didn’t get much sleep, as machine guns were peppering away all night, and the big guns fairly shook the ground. I was just dozing off when something landed with a thud right alongside my head. I hopped out quick and lively and struck a match to discover a tin of corned beef had fallen off a crosspiece of the roof. It was a great relief. We were not troubled all night as they didn’t have a single casualty, which was a jolly good thing for all concerned. \n","242":"\n\nLill’s Birthday. Hope I’m home for the next. \n","243":" \n\nWe got up about 8 and \"Fossicked\" around for some means of making tea. We came across the \"dug out\" which the","244":" Batt. details had been using. Here we found cheese and tea and sugar and a primus stove and soon had a good feed inside us. Then we walked along to the front line trenches, which the Batts. had occupied during the night. Saw Peter, who was having a good time sorting out hand grenades. The German trenches are about 2 or 3 hundred yds, away and we could see them quite plainly through the periscopes. The trenches are a huge maze and if it were not for the direction being posted up at the corner one could easily get lost. Our relief arrived about 2.30 so we handed over to them and returned to our Brewery where we told our tales of \"daring do\" to the rest of the crowd. Then we had a good feed of stew and a good wash. Just as we started eating \"Billsey\" May and \"Snowy\" Atherton arrived back with the first casualty. A chap named Cochrane of the 29th Batt. A shell made rather a mess of him. He had the honour of being the first of \"Tivey’s Tourists to get hurt. Several other cases arrived during the night, making a total of 8. One chap came in badly knocked about by a machine Gun. He dashed over to the German lines and grabbed a flag from the trench parapet but they got him on his return trip. His name was Borchard, a Lth. in the 14th Battn.\n\nWednesday 12th\n\nThe guns were lively all night and we got very little sleep. One good thing Breakfast was not till 11, so we had a good sleep in. I don’t think our poor old Brewery will last much longer as the shells are bursting all around it. There is a pretty little cottage \n\nnext door with a nice garden. Had a look round this morning. There are apple and pear trees there, but the fruit is not too ripe yet, worse luck. There are some beautiful roses blooming there and the perfume from them is very sweet. A crowd of us were sittingup in the cookhouse yarning when bang, a shell burst about 20 yds. away and stones and loose earth hit against the iron gates. It took us about 5 sec. to get down below to our cellar. \n\nThursday 13th\n\nSlept soundly last night, in spite of the Guns. Things were quiet only 1 casualty arriving during the night. A chap from the 29th got pipped in the arm whilst fixing up the sap. A shell dropped in among the 13th Bat. yesterday, killed 2 and wounded 1. They are burying them tonight quite close to our Brewery. Did some washing this morning. Came out to the trenches at 2 on duty again. We are at \"White city Post\" this time. Last time we were at \"Tramway Post\". This is a much more pleasant dug-out than our last. It is as quiet as the grave just as I am writing this. The birds are chirping away quite merrily and it is jolly hard to realise that the Germans are so near. Things were quiet till about 9 p.m., then the guns got busy. Bricky Howard and Hancock formed a party and Macdougall and I the other. We tossed up before we retired to bunk, to see who should take in the first case, and we lost.\n\nFriday 14th\n\nAbout midnight one of the details called me to take in a walking case. His name was Cope, or B.Coy. 29th Batt. and he was wounded in the head by shrapnel. The guns were kicking up an infernal din but we arrived safely within about 200 yds. of our D.S. when a shell burst almost on top of us, and several more round about. We flopped down with our faces in the garden of a cottage and then for about 10 mins. (which seemed to me 10 years) the ground round about us trembled beneath a terrific fusilade of shells. We quite expected every moment to be our last and heaved a big sigh of relief when it was over, and we were still alive. We covered the remaining distance in double quick time. On my way back to the trenches I met \"Mac\" with another walking case, another 29th man, who was shot clean through the finger.\n\nBois Grenier\n\nThe next case was serious and Howard and Co. had to carry him in. All through the night we were kept going. The Germans had the range of our trenches and to make things worse, it rained and made the going very heavy. Capt. Wooster and the nursing crowd had a busy time too. This is quite the most exciting night we have had, so far. About 7.30 we had a cup of tea and a snack, then we turned in and slept soundly till 2 when our relief arrived and woke us up. Returned to our old Brewery and had dinner. Then at 6 went on Gas Picket and S.P. was jolly glad when 9 o’clock came, as I was tired out. Mail came in. Got 3 letters from France, and 1 from Cis, all well Horray. Wrote to France.\n\ncont. from July 7th\n\nThis morning Mc Mahon, Townsend and a No. of others are up for being absent after 9. It was the fun of the world to see the crowd arrived Home last night. The Champagne had been flowing freely and everything was \"merry and bright\" Mac, Son Alldis, Miles, Sheehan, Brady and I had a small party, to celebrate our first \"Pay day\" in France and cracked a few bottles, but we arrive home in time for roll call at 9. After roll call they called for 12 volunteers to fill the water cart. Mac Alldis and I were in the mob. We left camp 12 strong with Lorry Trousdale in charge alright, but on our way to the water we met the \"late birds\" returning home, all in very good humour of course, they must all \"fall in\" behind us, and by the time we reached the water we were about 50 strong. They gathered round the water cart and sang till about midnight, when Serg.Thomson \n\narrived with a few others, looking for the water cart.. This meant more conviviality and about 1 o’clock everyone was so happy that the water cart was entirely forgotten. All that was required was \"a fair\" crack of the whip\" Frank Woods lay down in the road and went to sleep. I was not too well and went back to camp. The last thing I saw was \"Miles\" proposing the health of \"Maudie\" standing on the roof of a transport waggon. The Water cart eventually arrived about 4 a.m. and very remarkable, it was actually filled. \n","245":"\n\nOn Gas Picket and Aeroplane lookout from 6 till 9 at 9 woke up Lanc (my relief) had Breakfast, Bacon Toast and Butter then \"turned in\" and had another sleep. Things quiet all day, although plenty of aeroplanes about. Only one case came in during the night, the N.Z. relieved our Batt. in the trenches last night and about 9 o’clock Fritz started the ball rolling. A shell dropped in the trenches, killing 2 and injuring 2. These were the last cases we received as the N.Z. Amb. relieved us at about 11. Then we had another exciting trip along the roads to Headquarters. The guns were playing up everywhere. 2 signallers were blown to pieces, but we arrived quite safely about 2.30 a.m. \n\nSunday 16th\n\nThe rest of the crowd greeted us very heartily. Payney and a host of others came round and shook hands and made us feel like bloomin’ ‘eroes. We got to bunk in the orderly room about 3, slept till 9 then got up and had breakfast. Just as I was getting up, Ted brought me \n6 letters \n which was just great. \n4 from Lill 1 from Nell and 1 from Mother.\n This is a big brewery where we are staying. Using it as a Cas. Clearing Hosp. No of gassed cases came in during the night. The brewery is in working order and there is plenty of Beer to be had for the asking. \n","246":"\n\nThe Kaiser used this place for his Headquarters, till the Tommies arrived and he \"got\" for his life. There are plenty of rations about, plenty of butter and jam. Got an issue of smokes 4 pkts. Cigs and tin tobacco, but best of all is the glorious big mail. I just sat up in bed and devoured ‘em word for word. Spent the day quietly putting our things in order. About 3 in the afternoon Bob Roberts started rushing around with a list of names to go out to the trenches again. My name was down, but I hurt my hand yesterday, fooling around with a cartridge and so had to stay behind. Mac and Wrighty and Bricky and most of the old crowd went out, but no nursing men went this time. Capt. Irving Hutchinson and the great \"I know – what\" went with ‘em. Went to bed early, as have had very little sleep during the past week. Things are very quiet about the village of \nFort Rompu.\n","247":"\n\nCpl. Marlow called down some strong language on his head by rousing me at 6 a.m. to be on picquet \"Blue\" went on 1 entrance gate and I the other came off at 10, had a wash an went back to bed. Slept in a loft over a pigstye, aroma very\"high\". Plenty of clean straw. Nothing much doing all day. Wrote letter to Mother. Things were quiet along the front last night very few cases came in. Went on picquet again from 6 til 10. Plenty of traffic of all kinds going along the roads. Wasn’t sorry when 10 came, then turned in among the straw again. About 2 a.m.\n","248":"\n\nCpl. Roberts roused us all on the \"Gas Alert\" then everyone was scrambling around after his helmet. On \"no duties\" today so am taking things easy. Nothing came of the Gas Alarm \"Fritz didn’t send any over, had an easy day, not many cases coming in. Changed my quarters to where the Aroma is not so high.\n","249":"\n\nAnother quiet day. Only a few cases coming in. One poor Chap died as soon as he arrived. Went to Bath House where I had a hot bath and change of clothing. This is a great place. We hand in our dirty clothes and get a complete clean outfit, socks, shorts, underpants etc. after bathing we hand in our dirty towel and get a clean one in exchange. Besides we can get our clothes fumigated while we wait. B.Sec. of the 14th F. Amb are running it. They have a party of French girls to sew buttons and do repairs. The germans dropped a few shells on a \"factory\" in the town this afternoon and made rather a mess of it. \nWrote to Cis.\n","250":"\n\nLast night about 5, one’s ears were deafened by the terrific din of the bombardment. Things were quiet at our Clearing Station, the patients dribbling through in one’s and twos, abut 10.30 5 Germans wounded arrived under an armed Guard of N.Z, of course everyone rushed to have a look at ‘em and also see what could be obtained in the way of souvenirs. Their buttons disappeared very soon, All our M.O’s were out in the trenches at the various dressing stations leaving only the Col. and \"Maudie\". Only 1 of the 5 was badly injured. He had a nasty wound in his back the rest of ‘em were only slightly wounded. A number of us climbed up a tree at the back of the Brewery, where we got a good view of the bombardment. Our chaps were to change about 6, and we heard that they had captured the first 3 lines of trenches with very little loss. Of course everyone was delighted I \"Turned in\" at about midnight but everyone was too excited to sleep. About 2 o’clock every available man was called for to go it as Bearers, All B. Section, with the exception of about 10 of us, were already out. And all of C. Section, A. Section, transport and all turned out like one man, it was everyone one was dead anxious to be first, the rest of us had to stay behind to unload the ambulances. \n\nCroix Blanche\n\nAbout 4.00 a.m. the rest of us in B.section got Sgt. Mathieson to ask the Col. to let us go out. As soon as he gave the word, we got our water bottles and field dressing pouches, grabbed a piece of bread, and bacon and got off in one of the ambulances. The wounded were beginning to arrive and everybody (even the batmen) was working at top speed. We got out to the 15 F.A. Dress (Eden Hall) Station about 5, and what a sight it was. Shells were bursting in every direction and as far as one could see the wounded were strung out along the road. Some on stretchers, some crawling or hobbling along using timber out of the trenches as crutches. Some of the poor beggars were terribly wounded yet they never murmured and some of ‘em were even cracking jokes. We reported to Major Williams who said, \"Ha, Right O lads, you are just come in time, the R.S.B.’s are absolutely knocked up and you can relieve ‘em. This meant going right out to the front line trenches which was very very lively, and badly knocked about by the Hun shells. \n\nI’ve been made to feel small before, but on hearing the Major say this I positively shrivelled up. Tom Davies was at the other end of the stretcher. We went along to the firing line, both of us too full for words. There was plenty of work to do, as the wounded were lying about in hundreds, so we picked up the first one we came to, he was badly wounded in the stomach and every move caused his agony. It was an awful trip back to the D.S. In places the trenches were blown up and we had a job to be by with the stretcher. It was about 2 ½ miles from the front line trench to the D.S. and with a 12 stone man for a load it was mighty hard work. What a different tale was told this morning. Our lads got into the 3rd Line trench alright, but the Hun guns made ‘em too hot to hold and they had to retire back to their own starting point. We passed some of the 30th coming out of the trenches and I asked a good number if they’d seen Peter H. but none of ‘em had, and I was just beginning \n\nto think he was a \"gonner\" when I ran into him. He was mud from head to foot, but beyond a few scratches form the barbed wire and a strained back he was unhurt. I painted him with iodine and put bandage round his back, which was all I could do. Our Doctors worked like Britons, in fact everybody did. We kept going till about 3 in the afternoon, when Brady arrived with rations, and we knocked off to have a feed. Everyone was too tired to eat much and when we got up again we were so stiff we could hardly walk. By this time, every available man was acting as stretcher bearer. Sergeants Officers, Transport men, English Tommies and a party of N.Z. A.M.C. men put in some good work. Towards the finish we were sorting out the dead from the wounded. Some of the poor beggars had been lying out all night, and they were just crazy when we carried ‘em off. It was Tom Davies was my partner on the stretcher, marvellous the big number of men who were only slightly wounded and the narrow escapes a great many had. One chap J. Nelly 56th batt. had the narrowest squeak of all. A machine gun bullet struck him on the buttons of his top R. pocket knocked the button off, passed through his pocket then through a leather wallet and 2 silk handkerchief (which were in an envelope to send to his sister) through his identity D and just grazed him across the stomach. He found the bullet in his pants. Another chap was grazed by shrapnel right across his \"Adams Apple\" we met Gen. Tivey going through the sap and he had a yarn with the wounded as we brought ‘em along. We took a good number of prisoners. One chaps a \"scotty\" of the 53rd, Stewart McCloud, captured 19 himself. He found them hiding down a well. Made ‘em come up one at a time and disarmed them. The \n\nfirst one he made shew him the mechanism of his rifle, then as they were handed to him he removed the bolt and broke them up. Then he searched em, and 2 of his mates happened to come near and he got them to give him a hand. He is only a little chap, but game as a bull pup. He came in last night to get some knocks on his hands patched up. I got a piece of copper from him off a German Shell. I also got a button from a big German who came in wounded. Bricky Howard covered himself with glory. He crawled over the parapet and brought in a wounded man from \"No Man’s Land\" Poor old bricky Mason got a touch of shell shock. We got back to camp at about 9 p.m. and every one was absolutely \"knocked out\" The cars were still arriving with wounded and Tom D. and I and a number of others helped with them till about 1 a.m. then we \"turned in.\" \n","251":" \n\nNo longer are we the \"bloodless eight\" but a good number are still \"Tiveys Tourists\" having been wounded and continued the tour to England. Our Amb. has been very lucky only 1 man, Beeston, C. Section, getting hit. He stopped a bullet with his shoulders. Didn’t \"turn out\" till dinner time, then I got up and had a hot bath, which was very refreshing. The Huns dropped a few shells in our Brewery and made us feel decidedly uncomfortable. One shell went through the roof of the estaminet next door. The woman who lives there is quite delighted about it and calls it a \"souvenir\" These French people are certainly optimists. Here was a woman with a few kiddies, stayed in her home with a shell right through it, and we \"brave heroes of the 8th, evacuated our loft just because a shell lobbed within 20 yds of it. We stayed in the trenches during the bombardment. \n","252":" \n\nSlept in till about 10, \nthen wrote to Lill.\n A few wounded continue to pass through, but things are becoming normal again. Everyone rushed to buy a paper this morning expecting to see a big account of the scrap, but all it had was just about 3 lines to say the \"Anzacs\" had taken part in a raid. It is hard to realise yet, what a small part we are of this huge army. We paid a visit to a shop kept by two young French women. They told us some very interesting yarns about the huns, when they were occupying this village. \nBac St.Maur\n one of ‘em the better looking of the two, said all the time the Germans were at their place she sat by the fire in her nightdress with a shawl over her head and made out she was sick. One day a German Officer came into the room and saw her, he said \"you sick\" \"Oui Monsieur\" said she, \"no good to me then\" said the Hun. There is no mock modesty about the French People, and they tell us things like this just as naturally as though they were speaking of the weather. I bought a pretty little silk apron and sent home to Lill. It was a good shop and one could get almost anything there.’\n","253":"\n\nSent P.Cds to Cis, Nell, Kath, Arthur, and David. Yesterday we were paid. I drew 20f. Things getting quiet again. Mac and I went for a good long walk in the country. It is looking fine now. Buttercups and daisies growing among the long green grass, the beautiful big shady trees, and the birds singing merrily and yet only a short distance away are numbers of men still lying out there with their faces to the sky, killed by other men and neither party know the reason why. It is a glorious thing to listen to the tales of how our fellows leaped over the trenches to get at the Huns \"legs in the air\" go top of the Wazza\" they sung out, and then away for their lives and into ‘em. \n\nHeard a good yarn this morning:- A general was coming along the road when the \"Gas Alert\" was given and he hadn’t a Helmet. Now it is a serious crime not to always have our Gas Helmets with us, one in a special pocket in our tunic and the other in a satchel slung over our shoulders. Of course the Gen. had a staff officer with him. They came across a Sentry \"Ha, Sentry\" said the Officer \"How many helmets have you\" \"Two sir\" said the Sentry, \"You might give me one then\" said the officer and taking it, he handed it to the General. They went on a bit further and came to where a Sergeant had a party of men on parade. The \"eagle eye\" of the Gen. soon spotted that the Serg. hadn’t a Gas Helmet, \"Ha Sergeant you on parade without a Gas Helmet, just take mine and show your men how to put it on, and report to me afterwards\" The sergeant took the satchel, and diving in his hand to get the Helmet, produced ----- a dirty towel and a pair of socks.) This is a fine big brewery where we are billeted. We can walk in and get a glass of beer, just when we fancy. Yesterday Mac, Stan Wright, Tom Davis and I went out to tea. Had a good feed of Eggs and Chips, and Brian Aspinall shouted us a bottle of champagne, which greatly improved things. It is a pathetic sight to see the tiny tots going to school with gas helmets slung over their shoulders.\n\nMonday 23rd \n\nAnother quiet day. On parade this morning the S.O. read out some very eulogistic messages from the G.O.C. and A.D.M.S. about the way we worked at Fromelles. The Battns. are recovering very quickly although some of them lost very heavily. Our officers are kept going, censoring the hundreds of letters that are being written.\n","254":"\n\nGood account in to days papers about our little scrap. A few were wounded arrived from the trenchs, suffering from high explosive shell wounds. \n\nThe RSB of the","255":" Batt. lost 11 men out of 14, which is a big percentage, about the heaviest of any crowd. I think the machine gunners come next.\n","256":"\n\nHeard this morning that the Austrians had \"thrown in the towels\" but it sounds too good to be true. Mac and I went for a stroll and cracked a bottle. We got orders to get our kits ready to move off at 2. To dye works, just outside Armentieres, now being used as Baths. After about 2 mile walks we arrived. It is a fine big building, and we lost no time in looking it over. We are camped in a big room in the basement and actually have bunks to sleep on, so we’ll take some waking in the morning. There are plenty of clothes in stock, so I can see B. Section going into action the next time with brand new outfits. Things look good to me, the only \"fly in the ointment\" being the big guns roaring, just to remind us \"there’s a war on.\"\n","257":" \n\nLast night the firemen got steam up in the boilers and we were awakened at about 6 a.m. by the squeaking of the machinery, which wanted oiling very badly. No one showed any signs of getting up until about 7. when the voices of girls and women were heard. This acted as an alarm, as everybody got up then to have a look at this crowd we were to work with. There were about a hundred of ‘em young, middle aged and old. Some of the girls were fairly good looking, but did not come within miles of our Australian factory girls. They are quite as cheeky though. We had a busy day scrubbing out the baths and getting them ready for business tomorrow. This was a laundry before the war, not dye works and was run by a German firm. It is almost within stone throw of Armentieres which is very much knocked about by the Huns, and this place is, so far, untouched. We knocked off work about 4, then we all had a hot bath and clean change of clothing. \n\nEverybody slept in this morning till about 7.30 as we had very little sleep owing to a Gas alarm. Bricky Masom was on picquet from 1 till 2 and he rushed in and woke us all up. We spent the rest of the night in expectation, but nothing came of it. Bathers commenced to arrive about 9. Last night we were allotted to our various jobs. Stan Wright and Frank Woods are M.P. Bert Hunt is issuing clean clothes and taking in dirty ones. \"Payney\" is looking after the Officers Baths, \"Bricky Howard is also in charge of a bath. MacDougall is in the store room with Frank Newton and I am in the Clothes Office, issuing clean tunics and pants. Not a bad job at all, too bloomin’ good to last I’m afraid. One big artilleryman came in with his tunic blown to ribbons but he wasn’t touched himself. There is not much doing, and we are all having a jolly good time. Alec is doing the cooking, with \"Bluey\" Stanton as Offsider, so that part of the show is alright.\n","258":"\n\nLast night Mac, Alldis and I took a stroll back to our Ld.billet at Enguingham, where we had a beer and a yarn with Madame. She says things are very quiet now, as all the soldiers are in the trenches. Bricky Howrd has been recommended for D.C.M. for hopping over the trenches at Fromelles under heavy fire and rescuing wounded man. \n\nOne meets quite a number of celebrities in these parts. Last night we came in contact with a Serg. in the R.C.A, who has the D.C.M. and also the French Military Cross, and today Serg. Bassett the first N.Zealander to gain the V.C. came in for a bath. He is quite an unassuming little chap, and was a Bank clerk before he enlisted. Snowy Atherton said to him, after he had bathed and dressed \"we don’t get V.C.’s here every day. Have another Bath\". There is a party of N.Z. billeted just behind our baths and last night they were bombing the fish in the canal. Got some beauties too, looked like perch.\n","259":"\n\nLast night I stayed at home and wrote to France also sent P.C. to Aunt Nell. Had just finished France’s letter when I got one from her. The baths were open today till 12, then the girls \"knocked off\" but we had to clean up before we finished. Had a jolly good dinner. Roast beef, potatoes and arrowroot. Red Cross comforts arrived I drew a shirt and pkt. of envelopes but swapped with Arthur Butler for a pipe. Miles \"Sheehan and a number of others from Fort Rompue came in for a bath stayed to dinner and had a most enjoyable time. Mac Miles and I went into Armentieres\" after dinner (on the way in we met Bluey Stanton, who introduced us to a farmhouse where we got a good glass of beer.) It is a fine big town, but is badly knocked about by shell fire. Parts of the town are absolutely in ruins. We saw 3 churches that were wrecked, blown to pieces. In one of them an enormous bell had fallen from the tower and was almost buried. Whole streets of houses were piled up one on top of the other. We went into several cottages and they were just as the people had left them, during the bombardment. Books and trinkets lying around, push carts, pictures on the wall, articles of apparel and all manner of things. In one cottage, which was an entire wreck in the centre of an upstairs room, was a small wicker table and on it was a small vase, with dead flowers in it. It was about the only thing about the place that was intact, so I put it in my pocket and if I can will send it home. There are still thousands of people living there although it is bombarded every day. We went into a place and had a feed of eggs and chipped potatoes. Half way through our meal the shells commenced to burst quite near and Mdlle. came in and said \"Messieurs,, when you finish, I close up and go to the cellar. Plenty big shell. No Bon\" So we hurried over our meal and cleared. It seems a bloomin’ shame that she had to go to the cellar, as she was a very nice Md.LLe. There are electric trams there but of course they have stopped running. \n\n Joy Koller, B.K. , Dick Scholer, and a party of C. Section arrived to assist us in running the baths. Got a letter from Kath. Also a snapshot. Commenced to write to Lill.\n","260":"\n\nQuite busy today, plenty coming in for baths and a big rush for clean uniforms. \nFinished writing my letter to Lill\n Got another letter from France, that makes 3 this mail. After tea, Mac, Frank Newton, Jemmy Woods and I, paid a visit to a house near by. There was a piano, and a chap out of R.E’s could and did play it very well. A party of N.Z. were there also and we had a most enjoyable time. Selection from Operas and some real \"slap up\" singing. Then we adjourned to a farmhouse near by where we got some very good homebrewed beer. The women folk were doing the washing. They had a dog working a big fly wheel, which in turn worked the washing machine. It struck me as a jolly good idea – for the women – but a bit rough on the dog. \n","261":"\n\nFritz sent a few shells over, which dropped uncomfortably close to our baths. \nPay Day.20 F.\n Went to our friends place at the farm and had another sing-song. Plenty of shells flying around the village. Baths kept busy.\n","262":"\n\nLast night the crowd were very noisy, coming home at all hours. Bricky Howard was very indignant, because some men came too late and couldn’t get a bath. He took his blankets and slept out in the paddock where the girls woke him up this morning on their way to work. C.Sec. got orders at mid-day on their way to work. C.Sec. got orders at mid-day to pack up and report back to Headquarters.\n","263":"\n\nO Lord we’ve got to leave our \"appy ‘ome, tomorrow. Another busy day in the Baths. This morning about 5, Jemmy Woods and Rass both got up. There was a pool of water near their bunk, and each was blaming the other for causing it. \n\nThey got anything but complimentary and \"Ross\" hit Jemmy on the jaw. Then Jemmy hit \"Ross\" in the ribs; and Ross stopped the fight to put his boots on. I don’t know what is wrong with this place 2 of C. Section had a scrap yesterday. We had a stroll round the village. It is a very pretty little place, but is badly knocked about by shell fire. There is a canal running just behind our baths. Big motor barges travel along it, some carrying blue metal and timber and barbed wire for the roads and trenches others are fitted up as hospital ships and carry the wounded away to the various hospitals.\n","264":"\n\nThe day of our departure. All mighty sorry. A party of R.A.M.C. (55th F. Amb.) arrived and took over the Baths. There were some very touching scenes when the hour of our departure arrived. \"Towny\" was mighty sorry sorry to leave \"Darkey\" \"Bricky\" was very popular, and I think the whole bloomin’ crowd in the laundry kissed him. Lieut. Macintosh came away in charge of us. We left the Laundry about 10 and arrived back at Fort Rompu about 12.30. Here we stayed for dinner. Back to the old B.B. & B. We left about 2.30 and after a very pleasant jaunt through the country we arrived at the village of Douglieu at about 4.30. It is a pretty little spot but is very quiet. We are billeted at a farm, where there are 2 of the dirtiest women I ever met. They are Flemish and more like Huns than French People. We are sleeping next to a pigsty and the aroma is very high. After tea we went for a stroll down the village. Paid a visit to the old Church which was used by the Huns as a Hospital but when the Tommies arrived and drove them out they poured petrol all over it and fired it. It is absolutely gutted only the outer walls remain standing. The old padre was there and told us all about it. He also gave us photos of the Church, which he autographed.\n","265":"\n\nAnother quiet day. Mail arrived at mid-day. \nGot a letter from France, also one from Nell\n telling me about having said \"yes\" to Mr. Hook. \nWrote to Mother, Lill and Nell\n also to \nMr. Hook\n to \ncongratulate him\n. Spent an enjoyable evening at the Tommies canteen, where they have a piano. Had a good old sing-song until they closed at 8. Then we came back to our farm and had some Grand Opera, in which the \"Roan Colt\" was the star performer. \n\n","266":"\n\nThe guns are banging away day and night, so Fritz must be getting some \"hurry up\" had a most enjoyable service in our Mess Room. Cosier took it and preached a jolly good sermon. A big mob of cavalry went by last night. They had just come from the Somme and looked quite battle scared. It is jolly cold in our dairy. Maj. Newell promised us an extra blanket, but we haven’t got it yet.\n","267":" \n\nLast night was A.Sec. \"night out\" quite a number of them returning with a decided list. We got our extra blanket last night and slept much warmer. This farm is also a kind of \"Rest Camp\" C. Section are running it, and they have a number of chaps to look after who are suffering from shell shock and other minor war complaints. Before we went to sleep we witnessed a bloodthirsty encounter between the \"Roan Colt\" and \"Mackiinlay\" It was a very good go, but \"Mac\" had weakened somewhat in getting down to the weight of the man from the Sugar Country. They draw a good house, but a large number of the \"front benches\" were \"dead heads\" Promotor Sullivan is doing his best to arrange a return match, but it would be much better for all concerned if he could eliminate a big number of \"Bakshee\" patrons. The result was a draw, as the referee could not decide which of the men had swallowed the most beer. \n\nWent for route march with Major Kay. We quite enjoyed it. The country is very pretty about here the cropsof wheat and oats are ready for harvesting and the pears and applies on the trees look very tempting. We saw plenty of women men and boys cutting the crops with the old fashioned sickle, and handbinding it. We travelled through a good few miles of country with crops on either side of the road, but only saw one reaper and binder, and that was a Massey Harris. After dinner B. Section had stretched drill which they thoroughly enjoyed (I \ndon’t\n think) Mac.D. and I were told off to make a grease trap so we missed it. Just before the 9 o’clock parade we had a sing-song and a few speeches were made by Bricky Howard and a number of them, protesting against the \"drill in the firing line\" Doherty fell foul of \"Serg. Steward\" Price and was awarded 3 days 2nd Field Punishment by \"Maudie\"\n","268":"\n\nOn Picquet. The rest of the crowd went for a Route March. On their return, we had a lively few minutes, owing to the crowd in the rest billet bombarding us with apples which they had collected during the march. We had more stretcher drill in the afternoon which was done with the usual \"gusto\" by B. Section. The 9 o’clock parade passed off uneventfully.\n","269":"\n\nRoute march in the morning. After dinner we went into Estaires. Div. Baths and had a bath and a change of clothes, which were very acceptable. Baths are not \nnear\n nor so good as the ones at \nErquingham\n which were running. Things rather quiet. A. Sec. returned from the trenches where they have been 3 weeks.\n","270":"\n\nOn picquet again. The rest of the crowd are waiting round A. Sections Tents and they are not going sore at all. We had the afternoon off and it passed quite uneventfully. Another party of A. Sec. went out to the trenches, they were 1 man short, so Bricky Howard filled the breach and went with ‘em.\n","271":"\n\nAnother route march, with Johnny Moore. Went through some very pretty country. The farmers are all busy getting in their crops of Wheat and Oats which are looking remarkably well. The women work just as hard as the men, even to cutting the corn, but in most cases, the men do the cutting and the women the binding. We passed several pretty little cottages which had very fine orchards attached, and the apples and pears looked very tempting. We got back to the farm at about 1 where a jolly fine dinner was waiting us. After dinner we spent a few very pleasant hours doing some more weeding. Nugget Bennet is on trial for saying just what he thought of the officers of the 8th ----------and \nthey heard him.\n","272":"\n\nMore bloomin’ weeding. But in another morning at it Glory! Hallelujah! Strawberry Jam on the Menu. After dinner we went with Corp. Fallon to the baths at Sailly. Or rather we were supposed to have done so, but Dodson, Wrighty and I fell out and spent a very pleasant afternoon at a pretty little wayside cottage where we indulged in light refreshment \"Nugget\" is under close arrest now, so his case is looking serious. The usual nightly bombardment took place and we did not get to sleep till nearly midnight.\n","273":"\n\nAnniversary of the formation of the \"Gallant Eight\" 12 months ago today Col. Shepherd and the \"Big Roan\" came to Liverpool and picked out A. & B. Sections. This morning the Col. made quite a decent speech about it, and said he was proud to be O.C. of such a fine Corps and a few more nice things, and ended up by calling for 3 cheers for the 8th which were given with justice, considering we were cheering ourselves. Then we adjourned to the Mess Hut where Cosier conducted a very enjoyable service. The singing was fine every man doing his best to make it a success. \"Cose\" preached a jolly good sermon, and we ended up by singing the Nat. Anthem. \n\nMail came in. Got letters from \nLill, France, Mother\n and \nErnest\n. Also 2 photos. from Lill and papers form France. On 9 o’clock parade we got orders to pack up and be ready to move off to \nEstaires\n early in the morning. Then the Col. sung out \"Thomas William Howard\" and Bricky stepped out (as usual borrowing some one elses hat) The Col. then read out that Bricky had been awarded the Military Medal, shook hands with him and called for 3 cheers, which were given very heartily, as Bricky is very popular with the crowd. \nI also wrote a long letter to Lill.\n","274":"\n\nReveille at 5 Breakfast at 6. Blankets and packs carried on the waggons for once. We left our \"aromatic\" farm about 2 in parties of 20. Marched along to \nEstaires\n in easy stages. Pulled up outside a church and waited to see the King and Gen. Haig go by. \n\nAll sorts of \"Furfees\" are flying around. The best one is that \"the King reviewed the Anzacs on the Somme and told them that in 26 hours they would hear news that would startle ‘em, and we are all wondering what the dickens it can be. We were all sitting around smoking and yarning when I saw a party of officers, some distance away, stand to attention. The next minute a motor car dashed by with the Royal Standard flying, and I caught a glimpse of grey beard, which was all I saw of His most \n\nGracious Majesty. After this excitement had subsided we \"fell in\" again and marched about another mile through the town to a big 3 storey building where we are billeted. It used to be a girls school, a few kiddies are still taught here, but the greater part of the building are taken upby the Military.\n","275":"\n\nOn picquet last night. Rotten job. Everybody else in bed and me actin’ as Guardian Angel. Today is the \"Immaculate Conception\" Celebrations. \n\nThe Church Bells have been clanging all day since about 5 this morning at 10 o’clock a huge procession was formed and passed through the main street of the town to the Church. It was quite an impressive affair. First came the children of Mary\" in their white dresses and veils and garlanded with flowers, then followed a few thousand more women and children. The priests chanted a verse of the Mass, and the girls joined in the chorus. After these the men and boys came along, all hats off. They carried banners and figures of the Virgin Mary and also joined in the Chants. At the tail end of the procession came the priests and altar boys. The priests in most gorgeous vestments and the boys in scarlet robes and lace surplices. They also sang and what singing it was. It sounded glorious those fresh young voices, and did one good to hear them. Mac.D. & I. are on S.P. again, so don’t have to attend any Parades. The rest of the crowd were given squad drill and instructions \"how to salute properly\". All this, after a year and nearly a half in the army. No wonder the crowd \"play up\" at times. Bricky is very busy building a new incinerator. Frank Woods and Wrighty are his fatigue.\n","276":"\n\nMail came in today. Got \nanother letter from Lill.\n Pay day too, received 20F. went out with Bricky to help him choose a present for his wife. Plenty of work for \"Sanitary Sams\" The Col.caught me with an apple in the garden and carried me, but dear old Cobber \"Maud\" was so overcome by my touching appeal that she discharged me \"without a stain on my character.\" The crowd are having more squad drill and are improving wonderfully. They actually \"formed fours\" correctly, once and their saluting is almost beyond reproach.\n","277":"\n\nWet Day. \nWrote to France\n Bricky went into Sailly to received his medal from the GO.C. The only bloomin’ hero our ambulance possesses, yet he had to walk out in the pouring rain. Another busy day for S.P. building new incinerator, etc. \"Nugget\" tried by courtmartial, but no sentence was passed, and poor Nugget is still in suspense. Nothing much doing.\n","278":"\n\nSomething rotten in the state of Denmark\" we were issued with one apple per man today. Last night we went into an estaminet to drink Bricky’s health, on getting his decoration. A big crowd of N.Zealanders were passing at the time, and Bricky took out his beer and gave it to one of ‘em. In a few minutes the whole crowd who had been in the estaminet were outside with jugs of beer, handing it to the New Zealanders as they went by. They had just come from the trenches near Armentieres, and they appreciated a drink very much. Brilliant idea of \"Bricky’s\". Remnants of Tommies coming from the Somme. They have plenty of trophies, in the shape of German Helmets, Belts, etc. \n","279":"\n\nChurch Parade at Y.M.C.A. Johany Moore played his violin, Adamson the piano and the singing was a treat to listen to Cosier preached the sermon and the service was most enjoyable throughout. After dinner Stan Wright, Dodson and I went through the cemetery. Part of it is handed over to the Military for the men who die in the hospitals. Cols and Sergeants and private are all buried alike with just a plain wooden cross to each, with the name stamped on aluminium and tacked on. They are all well looked after, and most of them have flowers growing on them. All the chaps who were wounded in our \"strife\" at Fromelles and died in Hospital are buried there and they are quite a big number. \nFinished my letter to D.O.L.\n","280":" \n\nSent Lace Home \n\nBricks and Cement arrived, so now Bricky and his staff are busy building our incinerator. Poor old \"Nuggets\" Award came through this morning. He got 90 days and reduced to the tanks. Rough Luck. Spent the afternoon assisting to build the incinerator which ought to be a success as we are getting suggestions from almost every bloomin’ member of the Amb. Mail closed at 5, so I packed the lace and a few trinkets and sent ‘em Home to \nM.S.\n Had a sing-song at night with Mac.D, and Frank Newton. Got our pictures taken with steel helmets on, but they are pretty rotten.\n","281":"\n\nStill busy on our incinerator. Bricky put in some good work. The Col. and Sergt. Price inspected it and \"Pricey\" said he thought the top of it would come in. We have crowds around every day admiring it and passing remarks. The burning question of the hour is \n\"Will the roof come in\"\n or \"will \nit stand alright.\n Numerous bets have been made and the situation is becoming quite exciting. Parcel Arrived.\n","282":"\n\nThis morning thanks to the unfailing energy of \"Jacko\" our Incin.\" Is rapidly nearing completion. We had a fire going and she burns real well. Last night I wrote home to Mother. The guns were making an awful noise last night so things must have been a bit lively. A Taube flew over, at a great height, but our Guns gave him such a hot time\n\nthat he cleared out very quickly. This is the first one we have seen for about a month.\n","283":"\n\n\"Dantes Inferno\" still going strong. The roof still holds up and the \"carping critics\" are all silent. Mail came in \nletter from Lill. Also a very welcome parcel.\ncontaining birthday cake and the wonderful socks. It had been a jolly long time in coming, but am jolly pleased it has arrived at last. It is \"Jacko’s birthday tomorrow, so we will save the cake and have a double event Birthday party then. There are plenty of Aeroplanes buzzing around, so something will \n\nevidently be doing before long. Stayed home and wrote to \nE & C.\n","284":"\n\nBuilding new Latrines. The rest of the crowd are out Harvesting for the Farmers. This afternoon \"Jacko\" bought a bottle of wine and we cut the cake and drank his health. Quite an interesting little ceremony. At night we adjourned to the \"Dive\" a nice little room with red curtains and a piano. There are barrels for tables and stools to sit on and the place is quite snug. Jemmy Woods opened the ball by playing a few lively marches, then \"Professor\" Newton got to work and played the accompaniments to the \"artiste\" who sang. Son Alldis gave us \"Mother Machree\" Jacks\" rendered \"Simon the Cellarer\" in an almost professional manner, Brady got through a very good monologue \"Singing Soldiers\" to the accompaniments of a lighted cigarette and Franks most sympathetic playing on the piano. Bricky Howard rendered \"I don’t want a girl from Cairo town\" in his most touching manner. Then came a gap in the programme, which I endeavoured to fill by warbling the evergreen \"Spanish Onion\" Tra-la.de-la\". By this time it was about to strike 8 by the old Church Clock, so we drank \"Jacko’s health to musical honours\" For his \"Jolly good fellow\" etc. and finished the night’s entertainment with \"farewell\" in which a number of Tommies joined and helped to make more noise.\n","285":"\n\nSome of the crowd are harvesting again. Some more of ‘em are helping to build a rest camp. \"Payney\" is one of the carpenters) compree carpenter? Jacko and I are busy on the new Latrine. We’ve got the roof on and finished her, excepting for the seats.\n","286":" \n\nWrote to Lill\n, also posted letters to C & E. and Nell. Got another letter from France. Went out to see Peter Hutchison at the Rest Camp which the 15th F. Amb. are running. He has had an ingrowing toe nail removed, but is otherwise alright. There was a \"Café\" next door, so \n\nPeter and Billsy May and I adjourned there and had some refreshment and a good old yarn about things in general. Peter’s crowd have been in the trenches \"on and off\" ever since our big \"strafe\" so they have a good dose. The 15th got orders to send out all their available bearers last night, so there must be something doing, and no doubt we shall get a call before long.\n","287":"\n\nNothing exciting happened last night. This morning some Red X comforts came in. Busy preparing for our concert. Got another letter from Lill. and 5 snaps also one from Aunt Nell. The concert came off at 7 was quite a success. The star item was a sketch got up by Blanton and a party burlesquing our Officers and N.C.O’s on Parade. My name was on the programme to sing, but (fortunately for the audience) I was a long way down and it was \"Lights out\" before I was called on. \n","288":"\n\nPouring with rain. I’ve got a rotten cold and I feel anything but happy. The guns are booking away merrily and must be giving Fritz a rough time. The comforts were issued this morning and we had quite a \"blow out\" for dinner. Tinned fruit, Pork and Beans etc., Our incinerator is doing good work, it was mentioned in \"Blanton’s sketch\" last night and caused a deal of amusement. Sergt.Van went away today, but left his batman behind. Poor Jemmy stayed home to-night and \nwrote to Nell, and Aunt Nell\n and started an Epistle to D.O.L.\n","289":"\n\nRaining like fury. More mail came in. Got letters from France and Kath. Yesterday \nI wrote to Aunt Nell and France\nnothing much doing. Last night was a very restless one caused by the unwelcome attentions of \"big Game\" Gave my blankets and clothes a good dose of \"insecticide which I hope will quieten ‘em.\n","290":"\n\nRain cleared and a fine sunshiny day, but plenty of clouds still hanging around. This being the last day of the month the question on everybody’s lips is \"are we going to be paid\" Good news in the paper. Roumania is giving Austria some \"hurry up\" so surely will soon end now. The Sanitary Police are busy paving the yard with old tins, which will make it nice and sloppy during the wet weather.\n","291":"\n\nBuilding new Latrines. \nPay day\n. Drew 20 f. Plenty of aeroplanes buzzing around, so Fritz is being kept on the move. Bill \"Lanc\" and a number of our big fellows are doing Police Work in the town. Things very quiet.\n","292":"\n\nAdded a little more to my \"weekly\" epistle to \nM.S.\n Finished the Latrines. After tea we adjourned to \"The dive\" but found it occupied by a mob of clearing hospital fellows whose language and general behaviour was very unbecoming so we \"cleared out\" and went to some place in the main street. There was a Piano and Frank Newton soon had the ball rolling. Tommy Ross and Nick Coxon obliged with songs, as also did Bob Roberts an Artillery chap was there making a nuisance of himself . \"Trev\" our \"Roan Colt\" got up and was rendering \"the Wattle around the Litchenburg\" in his best manner. Our Artill. Friend again interjected and on Coxon remonstrating he became very abusive and talked fight. In the end Nick cracked him a beauty in the eye, and our evening’s amusement came to rather an abrupt termination.\n","293":"\n\n20 battle-planes flew over this morning, so something must be doing and the big guns are banging away merrily. Finished my weekly letter to L.A. also wrote Mother.\n","294":"\n\nMaking fire buckets and paving the yard with empty tins. Raining like fun. \nYesterday\n \n\nbeing Sunday we got orders from \"Molly\" to pack up and leave our \"Happy little ‘ome. where we were so comfortable and clear out to the Baths. It is an awfully dismal place. The roof is full of holes and the rain pours in everywhere. We were quite \"cup up\" about it and had to resort to \"the Dive\" before we gained our normal spirits again.\n","295":"\n\n\"More fire buckets and still more fire buckets until the enemy is crushed\" MacDougall is painting flags. \"Frenchy\" is fixing up the Engine at the Baths, and Peter Dawson is at the 15 F. Amb. building a Rest Station so the 8th is being kept busy. Jolly good news in the Paper today about the Zep. Being brought down. They are turning our school into a hospital and 4 patients arrived today. \n","296":"\n\nGlorious day, just like a spring day in Sydney. One bloomin’ day is so much like another that its hardly worth writing about.\n","297":"\n\nLast night about 11, I was awakened by a terrific bombardment. The big guns fairly shook the building and the rat-tat-tat of the machine guns sounded almost like someone throwing pepples on an iron roof. \n\nNow and then a lump of plaster fell from the roof, and smashed in pieces on the floor. It was a beautiful moonlight night and I lay there gazing out of a big hole in the roof just over my head, and thought about the poor devils out in the trenches. This is Market day and the streets present quite a lively appearance. Mac and I having nothing much to do, took a stroll around and watched the people buying and selling at the different stalls. There were all kinds of things for sale. Fruit and vegetables, bales of material for making dresses, fowls, pigs, hairpins and almost everything imaginable. One old dame took my eye, she was buying a nightgown and held it up at full length. It was a real old fashioned one with long sleeves and fitted close up to the neck. \n\nIt brought back another such item to my mind but oh! what a difference.\n\n We arrived in the square just in time to see a big upstanding horse \"knocked down\" for 700 francs. It was quite amusing to hear the auctioneer yobbering away, about the horses, good points, in French. Another thing that rook the eye was about a score of fat little \"porkers\" asleep in a crate, lying on sweet, clean straw, they had been scrubbed with great care and looked much like a bunch of kiddies just washed to get ready for a school picnic. Stayed home at night and wrote to M.S.\n","298":"\n\nNo bloomin’ mail in yet \"Frency\" and \"Jacko\" got the pumps working today and several loads of clean clothes came in, so we had the pleasure of a hot bath and a change of clothes. Last night Aldiss met an old friend and got \"foo the noo\". On his way back to our billet after leaving the estaminet, he passed a post card shop and being in a humorous mood informed the young lady who kept it that it was time she closed and put out the lights, of course she was astounded, but mistaking \"San\" for a Policeman, she was about to close and wuld have done so, had not an Officer happened to be near by and explained things. Busy today whitewashing the new latrines that Dodson and Bill O’Sullivan have erected. Stan Wright is on the staff with me and we had quite a busy day.\n","299":" \n\nBaths opened for Business this morning. The first batch of rather ancient Ladies arrived on the scene just as we were getting up. There is a huge pile of dirty clothes to carry on with, so that will keep ‘em out of mischief till the bathers arrive and change their clothes. Last night our chaps sent over goodness knows how many thousand tons of ironmongery to Fritz and sleep was quite out of the question.\n\nEstaires Baths.\n\nMail came in. Got letters from Mother, France and actually the \"boy scout\" spent a quiet evening in our billet and wrote some more to \nM.S.\n","300":" \n\nBaths going full steam ahead, thanks to Les Townsend who was on night shift and had the boilers nearly at \"blowing up\" point when the engineer arrived on the scene. More mail came in today, \n2 letters\nfrom Nell \nand 1 short\nletter from L. \"I am going into the garden to eat worms now\" and somebody will know why. \"Apre le Guerre\"\n","301":"\n\nMore mail came in. Got 2 letter glorious ones from M.S. and a very nice card, so the sun is shining once more\" Weather getting cold and we appreciate our warm clothing. Things very quiet at the Baths. The bloomin’ machinery is always breaking down.\n","302":"\n\nA.D.M.S. came round and inspected the Baths. \"Molly\" is strutting about like a Turkey cock, in a brand new uniform. Received cheque from M.S. There are about 30 of us working the baths and today we had 25 in for a Bath, so it’s a might expensive wash our soldiers get. Stayed Home at night and wrote to M.S. which is always such a pleasant task. (Please don’t think I’m leg-pulling\" Mrs Moore just because you sent me that cheque which arrived today).\n","303":" \n\nSaw a crowd of Engineers and \"red caps\" examining the Bridge over the canal this morning and wondered what was going to happen. My curiosity was shared by a good many as a big crowd soon gather. Presently the earth trembled and a big traction engine came along, hauling an enormous gun. The \"heads\" had examined the Bridge to see if it would bear the weight. They gave the driver the word and he steamed slowly on to the bridge until it had the full weight on, then he went, \"full speed ahead\" and one could almost hear the big crowd heave a sigh of relief when she reached the other side safely. \n\nFive other guns passed over, together with their attendant motor lorries and travelling workshop but they didn’t cause half the thrill in going over, as the first gun did. One of the traction engines caught an iron support and threw the driver with great force on to his boiler. He is in hospital suffering from a badly burnt face. Bread is very scarce lately, owing to our rations being reduced. \n","304":"\n\nThe stokers ran out of coal last night and there was no hot water for the women to wash with so they had to return home. Last night Jack Fallon and I went to the Butchers and fixed up his finger which he had cut, badly. He thought it was wonderful (our doctoring) and insisted on our assistance to get outside two jugs of beer. \nPay day drew 20f\n\nA party of C. Section bearers went out to the trenches this morning. It is jolly cold,, and seems as though winter is coming on rapidly. Several loads of coal arrived this morning, so the wheels are going round again, and the Madames can carry on with their washing.\n","305":"\n\nBig crowd came in for a Bath today again and made things lively – a couple of Engineers have built us a mess room and we are feeling a bit more civilized, although it is very draughty. Was just returning to our billet, after a stroll round the town, when we caught sight of an unusual glare in the sky. We made our way in its direction and found a building blazing away quite merrily. The fire Brigade was on the scene and did good work, considering that it consisted only of an old fashioned pump, mounted on a handcart and about 20 yds of 1 inch Hose pipe. A party of Tommies were formed in line down to the canal and passed a bucket along. The bucket leaked badly and by the time it reached the end nearest the fix it was almost empty. A poor old horse was tied up in the Building and was so badly burnt that it had to be destroyed. The building was absolutely gutted. No wonder. \n","306":"\n\nGot another letter from France this morning, which makes seven I received this mail. Tray Bon. had fried chops for dinner which was a great treat. Wrote to Mother and Nell and sent P.C’s to France and Arthur. Went to Pictures. They start at 7 and finished at 8. And it was quite the most appresive hour I have spent since being in France. Mac and Wrighty came with me. The price of admission was 2d. Mac and Stan got seats together. I sat in the row behind between a fat \"madame\" and a cheeky young \"garson\" who immediately put in the nips for \"Cigarettes Monsieur\" Only 3 pictures were screened and all of a most bloodthirsty Nature. The music was supplied by an old worn out gramophone. It shrieked and groaned most dismally. Just as the beautiful young damsel rescued the wall-eyed hero from being blown from the mouth of an ancient cannon, the gramophone struck up \"God Bless the Prince of Wales.\" It was difficult to see the pictures through the thick haze of tobacco smoke and when the door opened to let us out into the fresh air it was a great relief. \n","307":"\n\nGlorious sunshiny day. Taube flew over and got a lively reception from our A.A. Guns. \nFinished\n my weekly epistle to M.S. and posted letters to Mother and Nell and P.C. to France and Arthur. After dinner Wrighty and I went for a stroll along the Banks of the Canal. At night we adjourned to an estaminet near the Cemetery, where a lady friend of Wrighty’s exhibited her very fine collection of badges and told us some of her experiences among the Huns which was most interesting to listen to. Then I went to the Butchers fixed up his cut fingers.\n","308":"\n\nThe owner of the Baths came buzzing round this morning and found fault with every thing. Trenchy was using some new betting and he nearly went mad, threw his arms up in the air and swore volubly, in his native tongue. A party of our chaps were in the Engine Room trying to get the big engine to go, \n\nhe grabbed hold of Billsy May and tried to throw him out, but Billsy was a bit too solid, and if \"Molly had not arrived on the scene just then Mr. Frenchman would have got a crack. After tea we visited Madame at Carlos\" and enjoyed a glass of wine. \n","309":" \n\n\"Florodora\" went away on leave this morning, Tom Davis, is very disappointed that he didn’t go too. Mail came in this morning. \nGot a long regd. letter from L.\n When I first opened it I thought \"that dear old silly\" has sent another cheque and was pleased to find out that she hadn’t. Quiet day at Baths. Stayed Home at night and wrote \nto M.S.\n\nWednesday 20th \n\nGot word this morning that we are to pack up and move off again. Jolly good job if we do as these baths are too quiet. The M.P’s went into our old lady’s kitchen this morning and put it out of bounds, so no more 11 o’clock Beer for the 8th. The cooks have built an oven and we had Roast Beef and baked Potatoes for Dinner.\n\nHouplines\n\nThursday 21st \n\nGot word at mid-day to pack up and report at H.Q. at 3.30. Leave is cancelled, so \"Goodbye to \"Blighty\" On arrival at H.Q. we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were going to ride out in the motors----just the Advance Party – 16 men from good old B. Section.\n","310":"\n\n I finished my epistle to L.A. and went to post it, but discovered the Orderly Room had packed up, so my letters will have to go with me to the trenches. After the usual amount of fooling around we boarded the cars and rode merrily away, \nthrough Armentiers.\n (which is knocked about much more than when we were there last) to \nHouplines\n where our advanced dressing station is. It is a fine big residence with an enormous garden at the back and surrounded by fine big trees. It is the property of a Scotchman, and there is a big weaving mill in the grounds. Although the other houses around are in ruins, this one remains practically untouched. \n\nThe","311":" Highland F. Amb. is in charge,, and a party of them were playing croquet on the lawns when we arrived. Serg. Johnnie Moore asked one of us to go Cook, until the rest of our crowd arrived, so just for a change I took it on. The scotties are a very decent crowd and made us feel quite \"at Home\" They cooked the tea, and Mac and I washed up. There were tables and chairs, knives and forks, and even a big clock and pictures on the wall. We had bully beef, cheese jam and butter for tea, and it was quite a treat to feel ones legs under a table again. After tea a party of 8 went out to the trenches. The rest of us stayed in and played cards.\n","312":"\n\nArose from my virtuous couch at 7.30 washed and shaved then played a game of croquet before having breakfast. The Scotties cooked the Bacon and got breakfast ready and I washed up assisted by Laycock and Sullivan. After breakfast, I had a look through some of the ruined houses in our vicinity. Every house for miles around is in Ruines and \n\nthey are just as the occupants left them during the bombardment. Pictures still hanging on the walls, and clothing of every description lying about. In one house was a baby’s cot all complete with its little sheers and a pretty quilt. Near by was a baby’s hat, a straw, trimmed with forget-me-nots. It nearly made me cry when I saw it. We went into a milliners and there were scores of hats of all shapes, trimmed and untrimmed, some of them had the prices marked on and varied from 10 F to 40 francs. Hat pins and belt buckles were there in abundance, but mostly of a cheap quality. One big drawer was full of kiddies hats, and they were sweet and pretty. Of course we had no business in these places and would have got into serious trouble had we been caught, but luck was with us. \n\nWe had bully beef and boiled potatoes for dinner, which went down well (there is an estaminet a few doors away from our A.D.S. where a rather pretty girl serves out glass of refreshing French Beer to thirsty soldiers, straight from the trenches. The building is an absolute wreck and is liable to get a shell in it at any time. If any woman deserves a V.C. it is that \"fair Marie\") Another 16 men arrived, about 2 o’clock 8 more of us came out to the trenches, and the other 8 stayed to assist at the D.S. There are 3 posts for S.B. 1 and 2 are in houses near the trenches and No.3 is away in the trenches. We arrived there about 5 just in time for tea. Just before we left the D.S. one of the Scotty’s and Roy Knowles brought in the body of Serg. Grey of the 1\/5 Gordons.who had been shot through the heart by a hun sniper. He was an enormous chap well over 6ft and built in proportion. We are attached to the Gordons, who are a fine crowd of chaps and most of them big men. We work in parties of 4. Stan Wright. Mac.D. Tom Moroney and I form one and Billsy May, Snowy Atherton, Bert Hunt and \"Murph\" No.2. There are 2 dug-outs and 4 of us are camped in each. Our first patient was a hefty young Highlander who had a bad dose of diphtheria and we were very glad to unload him at our D.S. as he was some weight to carry. We had 3 other cases during the night. The Germans put a lucky shell into the Gordons Bomb Store and the explosion got the 3 of ‘em. One was a S.N. We got back safely and were just dozing when the \"Gay Gordons\" started their game going with their trench mortars. The noise was terrific and \"Fritz let us have a good few in return. The machine guns swept like rain across the iron roof of our dug-out, and a \n\nnumber of shells burst rather too close to be comfortable. I quite expected to \"go up\" at any moment, but after about 2 hours things got quiet again. All the harm \"Fritz\" did was to explode our bomb store.\n","313":"\n\nSlept in till about 10, when one of the \"Scotty’s\" came and hauled us out of our bunks. It was too late to cook breakfast, so we just made some tea and had a piece of bread and jam. These Gordons are a hardy crowd they wear nothing under their kilts, not even in the depth of winter. There is a party of Engineers working just across from our dug-out and Fritz’s look outs must have caught sight of ‘em, as he \"plonked\" a few shells in amongst them, but no one was hurt. A party of the 29th Batt. were digging in the sap, when they came across an unexploded German Shell one of them (the Sergeant) unscrewed the nose cap. He was killed and the other 8 wounded.\n","314":" \nIn the Trenches\n\nA glorious sunshy day. Things are very quiet and it is hard to realise that there is a war on and that Fritz is only about 200 yds away, with all his murderous machinery. A party of Gordons raided the enemy trenches last night and every man got back quite safely. I was finishing my weekly epistle to M.S. one of the Gordons got a parcel with some \"Hieland\" Heather in it. He gave us all a spray and I enclosed mine in L’s letter. I posted a letter to France. I was cook today. Made some stew, they all passed rude remarks about it, but there wasn’t a tiny bit left and \"hungry Murph\" cleaned out to the Pot. The Northhum\"d \"Fus\" lrs came into the trenches as soon after dinner and relieved the Gordons. We were sorry to see the Scotties depart as they were a fine crowd and we got quite \"chummy\" with Cpl. Grant and a few others. Before they went we exchanged badges, for souveniers the N.F. (26th) have just come from the Somme and are full of news about the \"big Push.\"\n","315":"\n\nThese Fusiliers have plenty of machine Guns with them and they gave Fritz a lively time last night. We didn’t have a single casualty and slept peacefully. Bert Hunt & \"Snowy\" cooked the bacon for breakfast and made quite a decent stew for \"dinner, about 11 a.m. a party of N.F.’s were fixing up a machine Gun when a Hun sniper got a Sergeant and a private, both shot in the head. The private named Frith got off lucky, but poor Serg. Dash died almost as they carried him into the DS. His brains were splashed all over Frith’s helmet. \nStan Wright’s\n Birthday. He brought a jar of beer back and we celebrated the event in our Dug-out. The Col. Paid us a visit this morning, but did not stay long. Our aeroplanes fly over Fritz’s trenches in dozens, and it is quite amusing to see the amount of ammunition Fritz wastes in trying to bring them down. We were issued with leather gloves this morning to protect our knuckles in these narrow snaps.\n","316":"\n\nQuiet night again, no casualties. Our machine Gunners spotted a German working party, and let ’em have it, thick and Hot Murp\" changed places with Roy Knowles, so\" Roy is among the Dinkums \" again. Not a single casualty all day. They expected a Gas Attack last night but Fritz didn’t send any over. \nWrote to France.\n We cleaned our dug out, out this morning. The place is alive with mice and rats. Scores of cats are here after the rats and between them they make an awful mess. The huns have got the range of the sap leading to the Guards dug out, next door to ours. The machine gun and a snipers bullets whizz by uncomfortably close and it’s a case of \"keep your head low\" Stan Wright and I were returning from taking in a sick N.F. and had almost reached our D.S. when a bullet struck a tree and spashed on to Wrighty’s helmet. I felt myself all over.\n","317":"\n\nLast night Fritz made an awful din with his whizz-bangs, but did no damage, so we didn’t get a call. Tom Mooney is cook today and fed us real well. Got another letter from France today, also some papers. One of the \"Whizz Bangs caught a N.F. this morning and gave him a nice \"Blighty\" wound. He is quite delighted about it. Roy Knowles and I took him in. Most party went into the A.D.S., and got issued with Bose Respirators. Wrote to \nAunty Pudney, Nell and Arthur\n Had an enjoyable game of 500 before we \"turned in\" \n","318":"\n\nQuiet last night. Slept soundly till about 9 then got up and had some Bacon and fried bread. Nothing much doing all day in the trenches, but very lively in Armentieres. The Hunds put over scores of shells killing a number of people, including a woman and kiddie. Poulton of A. Sect. got knocked with shrapnel whilst standing outside the Y.M.C.A. We carried one man into A.D.S. with trench fever. Things got quite lively after dark. Shells and Trench mortars were banging away in every direction, but did no damage beyond keeping us all awake. \n","319":"\n\nCapt. Irving came along and paid us. I got 20 f. so we can keep on \"striking matches\". Took another Trench fever case in this morning. The corp.in the dressing station tells me that \"Trench fever\" is like having influenza ten times at once. Yesterday the 26th N.F. went into billets and the 24 N.F. took their place in the trenches. This afternoon \n\nFritz put a number of shells in among one of our working parties. They did no damage, and Fritz must have been sorry he spoke, as our guns took a hand in the game and blew his parapets\" sky high\" Added a few more pages to M.S.’s epistle before I \"turned in\"\n","320":"\n\nLast night I threw away a silver ring whilst emptying a dish of dirty water, and very luckily found it again this morning. \n\nLast night the snipers were busy and got 2 of the","321":" both in the head, One was killed outright. The other was very badly injured. We took him in to our D.S. about 3.30 this morning. It was pitch dark and the rain had made it heavy walking. The track is very bad in places and we had a torch with us which every time we flashed brought a shower of bullets around. There is one very bad open space of about 150 yds. Just as we started across a star shell lit up the bloomin’ scenery and one could almost feel the hiss of the bullets as they went by. To make matters worse our patient kept trying to get off the stretcher. What with holdng him down, dodging shell holes, and expecting every minute to stop a bullet our trip was quite eventful. We heaved a deep sigh of relief when we reached our dugout in safety again. \"Snowy\" Atherton and his party took in the body, after breakfast.\n","322":"\n\n Fine Morning, Things quiet last night. Plenty of our aeroplanes about this morning. \"Billsy\" May \"Snowy Atherton and I went into the A.D.S, for rations Church Service was on, so we adjourned to the Lawn where we had a very enjoyable few games of croquet. \"Snowy\" won 2 games, Billsy won the other after a very exciting finish. The Huns were putting over a lot of shells into Armentieres, and they shrieked right overhead as we were playing. We called in at No. 2 Post on our way back and had a yarn with Capt. Catford, who invited us to partake of a nip of rum, which we most certainly did as it was getting cold. \nFinished my epistle to M.M.\n","323":"\n\nThings very quiet. Weather cold and wet and muddy. Got a shock this morning. Tom Mooney arrived back with our Rum issue. Stan Wright got a parcel, which was sent for his Birthday. It contained shortcake and various other good things, so with these and the rum we had quite a birthday celebration.\n","324":"\n\nAnother wet day. Trenches very muddy. They made a terrific din with trench mortar last night and Fritz sent a big lot of \"mumies\" over, but we didn’t have a single casualty. There is a crowd of Frenchmen making drains near our dugout a number of shells burst in among them and it was quite amusing to see them duck. Quiet day, only one case to take in and him sick. Played 1\/2d poker after tea. \n","325":"\n\n24 N.F. changed over again today with the 26th They livened Fritz up with their machine guns. Had Roast beef and baked potatoes for dinner, which is not \ntoo bad\n for Trench fare. No bloomin’ mail in yet, we are beginning to wonder where it is.\n","326":"\n\nSnowy Hunt and his party went for a bath today to Armentieres. Fritz bombarded the town very heavily, but did very little damage, only injured a few civilians.\n\nGas Alarm. Thursday 5th\n\nGlory ‘Hallelujah’ \n Mail came in at last Got 2 letters from Lill and 1 from France.\n There is a chap named Foster in the 26th N.F. who comes from Stoke-on-Trent. I have had several interesting yarns with him about Stone. We took him into hospital tonight suffering from Malaria, which he got in the Islands. On our way back we found that there was \nGas Alarm\n so of course fixed on our Helmets, \nOUR\n chaps sent the gas over, but we also had to wear our Helmets in cast the wind changed and blew it back on us. This is the first Gas Attack we have been through and was quite the funniest experience we have had for a long time. We could see the Gas going over quite distinctly when the star shells burst. Fritz evidently expected the gas, as he sent up about ten times more star shells than he does usually and the place was almost as light as day. \n\nThe first funny item was the Guard pulling us up, before entering the sap. The breathing tube in our mouths makes conversation difficult and instead of being greeted with the usual smart \"Halt\" Who comes\" it was more like\" Yum. Yum, Yum and our usual reply \"Stretcher Bearers\" must have sounded very similar. Tom Mooney and Stan Wright were on ahead with the rations and Mac. D & I followed behind. Mac carrying the stretcher and I the kerosene for our \"Primus\". Our breath soon dimmed the goggles of our helmets, and it was very difficult to see at all. First of all I’d bang into a post and Mac would bump me with the stretcher then Mac\" would slip into a shell hole filled with water and I’d have to assist him out. Although the shells were bursting rather too close to be comfortable and the machine gun bullets were flying around, we had to laugh, we crossed over \"No man’s land\" much quicker than we do usually as it was decidedly unhealthy to linger. There is a bridge over a deep cutting, about half way across and we had our noses almost touching the ground as we walked along, so as not to miss it. It was with a big sigh of relief that we took off our Respirators when the \"alert\" was off as although the Resprs. are a big impreovement on our last issue, it is far more pleasant to have them off, than it is to breathe through ‘em. \n","327":"\n\nTom Moroney, Stan Wright, Mac and I went into Armentiers for a Bath. We took some bread and cheese and an onion with us which \"went down\" very well at lunch time, with a glass of beer. It is a pretty long walk to the baths through the town, which is in an awful condition thanks to the Huns. They bombard \n\nit heavily every day and there is hardly a single house without a shell hole through it. We arrived at the Baths at about 3 and had a most enjoyable hot bath and a change of clothes which were all \"brand new\" Then we went on to Esquingham to the Baths we used to run. The 104th English F. Amb is running it now. We also called in at the \"Farm\" and had a glass of Mdlle.Alines\" home brewed Ale. After that we spent an hour or so at Mwe spent an hour or so at Maggies’ place, where we had a sing song and arrived back in the trenches just in time for Fritz’s mighty serenade. \n","328":"\n\nLast night was just dozing off when our Artillery and Trench Mortars started a terrific bombardment, which lasted about an hour.Our dug-outs fairly shook and sleep was out of the question. Fritz replied with hismachine guns and also put a few shells over, but he did very little damage. One 2nd Ltd. Was killed (shrapnel through the neck) and a m\/gun Sergeant got his nose split clean in two. He called Fritz some awful names over it, as he was to have gone home on leave next Monday Mac and I took him in and when we returned we made a cup of tea, which wa very enjoyable. After Break, we took in poor Lieut.Esmonde. He is only a bit of a kid, about 19 or 20, and has only been here about a month. We had B.Beef and Baked potatoes for dinner again today.\n","329":"\n\nOn Friday night the 29th went over to Fritz’s lines on a bombing raid, but were not too successful. Glory we are staying on in the trenches for another spell. No one is at all anxious to relieve us. Our Gallant (?) \n\nOfficers are having the time of their lives, we have been out here now 16 days and during that time no officer or N.C.O. has been near us (not that we want ‘em) Certainly the Col. and Capt. Wooster did come down for about 5 minutes but as soon as they heard a bullet go off, they cleared for their lives. Finished off my weekly epistle to \"M.S.\" and posted it. Went to Bed early as I’ve got a rotten cold.\n","330":" \n\nVery quiet last night. Hooray, More mail in this morning \nGot 3 long letters from L. and 1 from N.\n also 2 snaps of the dogs. An officer Lt.Connor got his ankle smashed by a sniper and Bert Hunt and Co. took him in to the A.D.S. He had been waiting to put a German Sniper, out in \"no Man’s Land\" and was just hopping back over the parapet when he got spotted himself. \nWrote to France.\n Got papers from her this morning, which were mighty welcome as we are very short of reading matter.\n","331":"\n\nWoke up this morning to find unusual excitement just outside our dug-out. One of the Frenchmen who are digging drains in our lines, got shot in the leg by a sniper, and the rest of the crowd are buzzing round like a darktown Fire Brigade. No less than 10 of ‘em knocked off work to carry him in to the D.S. just after breakfast one of the N.F.S. got shot through the shoulder, so that’s No.2 hit to Fritz’s credit already this morning. Billsy May and I were Cooks today and the food was so excellent that the rest of the crowd want us to give ‘em lessons on Cookery. Write to Mother and Nell. The 24th came into the trenches to day and relived the 26th N.F.\n","332":" \n\nSnowy\" Bert Hunt and Co went into Pont due Nieppe Baths and got a clean change of clothes, Mac.D and I went in for the rations. They are packed up at Headquarters ready to move, so we shall soon be off again somewhere. \n\nHad a very rough tea tonight. The stew was very weak, and we had no vegetables. There were plenty of shells flying around today. Fritz is sweeping the road with his machine guns, so we are hoping we don’t have any cases tonight. It’s not healthy. \nWrote a long letter to M.S.\n as it may be the last chance for a time.\n\nThursday, 12th\n\nStan Wright and the rest of our party went into De Niepper Baths, which we greatly enjoyed. We had dinner at a cottage just behind Headquarters. Eggs, toast and coffee, which was a pleasant change after Trench Fare, They are busy packing up at H.Q. ready for a move. The Somme is favorite, but of course we are going. On our way back to the trenches. Mac & I stayed for a time and watched one of our batteries send a few souvenirs over to Fritz. We also went up to the O.P. and watched them bursting in the German Lines. Just after tea word was sent around that everyman not on duty in the lines, was to stay in his dugout as our guns were going to bombard very heavily, prior to a Raid. A few minutes of Sullings and Murph arrived and informed us that 4 of us out of the 8th were to proceed to No. 2 post at once. The air went blue for a time, but \"orders is orders\" and we had to go. We tossed up to see which of us should go,, and our party lost. So we grabbed our coats and started off. No sooner had we got outside our dug-out than Bang, Bang.Whizz third Bun-er-er, Bang the shells commenced to scream overhead, and stones and dirt were flying in all directions. The flash from the guns lit up the sky for miles around. Fritz had a searchlight going and what with this and the hundreds of star shells it was as light as day, and made us feel decidedly uncomfortable as we crossed some of the open spaces. The machine guns and rifles were also very busy and their hiss and pig scattered leaves and bark off the trees. \n\nWe reached the road in safety, to discover that Fritz was paying it very marked attention and we scrambled along with our noses almost touching the ground. We arrived at No.2 post without mishap and told Serg. Roberts what we thought of things. For 3 weeks we had been in the trenches, 8 of us and things were normal, and tonight when we are likely to be wanted, 4 of us are brought away. We stayed at the Post until things quietned down and as there seemed nothing doing we returned to our Dugout in the trenches. We went up to the Art look-out where we got a good view of the Bombardment Fritz sent over hundred of \"Munnies and made a mess of our parapets in place but only managed to wound 3 of our chaps. One in the face, another in the arm and the","333":" got hit in 5 places but none of them were badly hurt. Snowy, Bert Hunt & Co carried them in.\n","334":"\n\nThere were 2 raiding parties went over one from our Brig. and the other from 27 N.F. Ours was very successful they got into the German 2nd Line got 3 prisoners and a new pattern machine gun and got away again with very few casualties. The N.F’s were lucky they got over and were returning with one prisoner when Fritz machine guns caught ‘em and they suffered heavily. We are expecting to be relieved at any minute, but its 9 o’clock now and no signs of anyone coming, so we’ll go to bed.\n","335":"\n\nGot up at 8.30, had breakfast and waited for our relief. One poor N.F. got shot clean through the head by a sniper and our party carried him in to the Mortuary. We called in at No.2 post and found the cars waiting for our gear. So we went back to our dug-outs picked up our belongings and brought them back to the cars. Then we went into H. Maudie was there so we informed him that we were all broke, and to our surprise \n\nhe gave us 75 francs to distribute among the crowd. Stan Wright and about 5 others of us went into a house where we had a great feed of eggs and chips, which we greatly enjoyed, as we haven’t had a decent feed for some days, rations being very short, we left H.Q, at about 3, and marched about 2 miles to a big paddock, where the 8th Brig. were loading up in Motor lorries. Gen Tivey and most of the heads were there watching us load up. We dashed off at about 4.30 but I’m afraid that B.Sec. did’nt make too good a shewing. After a very pleasant ride we arrived at the little village of \nStrazelle\n, where we are billeted at a farm. We are camped in a big barn on nice clean straw and were not long in getting to sleep.\n\nSunday 15th\n\nArose about 7.30m and had a sumptuous Breakfast on bread and butter. Then we got orders to \"fall in\" at 9.30 in full marching order. Then we went for a route march. The N.Z’s relieved us at our last post. They have just returned from the Somme, where we are on our way to. The country round about is very pretty I would very much like to write to M.S, but its out of the question, worse luck. After dinner Mac & I went for a stroll through a couple of villages near by. It is glorious country around here, the old thatched cottages with their pretty gardens, the wind mills blowing round in a leisurely manner and the fat cows chewing their end and looking quite content with their lot. It seems a rotten idea that we are here for the purpose of taking part in a war. The trees are looking well, and there are tons of blackberries growing along the hedges of which we had a good feed. It was too late for tea when we returned so we went into a wayside cottage and a good feed of chips, eggs, and coffee. I had a rotten cold and it tightens up on my chest at night.\n\nMonday 16th\n\nReveille at 7.30 Breakfast at 8. Then we fell in on the Parade and those who were short of any underclothing had their names taken. After this we spent a very interesting hour in recording our votes for or against conscription. I think from what I hear that the men at the front will vote \"no\" and that Billy Hughes will get rather a shock, when the results go back. Bricky Howard was tried this morning for a very peculiar crime. It appears that while we were at Armentieres, he threw a live bomb into the Dispensary where Maudie Newell and a few others were. Luckily, it didn’t explode but it frightened about 10 years growth out of ‘em. He was let off with 10 days. 2nd Fd.Pt. But in the opinion of B. Section he should have got 10 years, for not pulling the pin out. After dinner we went for a route march through this very pretty country, and we enjoyed it very much. Had another rotten night, thanks to my cold.\n\nTuesday 17th \n\nThis morning we had breakfast at 7.30 and as we have no parade, till 1.30 we got busy getting our packs ready for the March. Fell in outside our billet and marched to Parade ground where we fooled around for about an hour before marching off on our way to \n\"the Somme\"\n It is some time since we had our full packs up and their weight soon brought out the sweat on the manly brows of the 8th. We passed a beautiful chateau quite the finest place I have seen in France. The grounds were surrounded by a double row of trees and there was a glorious avenue about 300 yds. leading up to the chateau and the gardens and lawns looked fine. The chateau itself is built of bricks painted white, with a red tiled roof. We arrived at \"Baileul\" about 4.30 in the pouring rain and it was mighty cold too. Women and Kids were selling cakes and fruit and did a roaring trade as we were all very hungry. \n\nWe marched through the town to the Station and got a board the train about 6.30. We loaded up 30 men to each covered van. There was plenty of clean straw and we didn’t mind being crowded as it made us all warmer. As soon as we had taken off our packs we had a feed of bully beef and Bread and the cakes we bought. As there was no tea to be had we bought wine and coffee from the cottage near the station. We left Baileul about 7 and had a very pumpty ride, but in spite of it all, after a game of cards and a read, we turned in and slept soundly.\n\nWednesday 18th \n\nArrived \nLongpre\n about 7 a.m. we had no rations and as soon as we pulled up there was a holy rush made for the Y.M.C.A. tent to purchase coffee and biscuits. Only about 200 got served the rest had to be hungry. The Y.M.C.A. is without doubt a Godsent to Soldiers, as they follow us up every where and any one who subscribes to its funds, gets a good sum for his money. We fell in about 11 and marched with full packs up through the mud and slush. The crowd were in good humour and good old B.Sec, led the way. We sang and passed remarks about the officers which is a favorite pastime among our crowd. \"Molly\" dashed by on his charger and someone told him to get inside and pull the blinds down. We marched along for about 2 miles then we had a spell. The country is very hilly and quite a number of B.Sec. had sore feet but with true Christian Fortitude they cried \"Excelsior\" and dashed onward. We got an awful shock to see our gallant officers marching with packs up. I’m sure that Capt. Woosters pack must have weighed nearly 2 lbs. yet he never faltered we halted for dinner about 12 and were issued with Bread and Bully beef and water to drink. The scenery was glorious, fine big trees and the green grass in the meadows showed off the red roofs of the houses to perfection. \n\nAfter about eight miles marching, with mud up to our ankles, we arrived at \nErgnies\n a pretty little old fashioned village, where we billeted at a farm. A fine residence it is where B. Sec. are, nice cool cool brick floor and plenty of freshair in through the broken windows and down the chimneys We strolled through the streets in search of a shop or estaminet, where we could buy something, but every place seemed to be sold out. About 6 B.Sec. fell in and marched down to the cookhouse for tea, singing \"we are a ragtime army\" Maudie and Milly were in great form. Molly said some funny thing ending in \"Have not they\" which of course started the mob laughing. The 2 M’s got real wild, and Maudie called us a \"log of skinks\" which amused the crowd more than ever, we had B.B. stew, Jam, Butter and \"praise the Lord\" some tea. It seems ages since we had tea before, and it went down real well. After tea we had a \"slap up\" \"sing song\" B. Sec. were positively brilliant, and the talent that showed up was amazing. Harry Douch sang in an almost professional manner, each song being greeted with salvoes of applause and onces of \"more\" The choir joined in the choruses with great gusto \"Miles\" Sheehan gave a speech on \"why I enlisted\" and his remarks greatly appealed to the younger member of B.Sec. The \"Roam Colt\" gave us a few interesting reminscences and also recited \"The wattle round Michenburg\" in a most touching manner. At intervals the choir rendered well known choruses and the part singing was very fine indeed \"Payney\" who, some time ago, figured in \"Talk of the town\" explained the reasons for forming the \"Philarmonic Society\" It is expected to render assistance to men who are disabled in the war. To become a life member only costs 5 Francs, but members are very backward in coming forward and Mr. Treasurer Payne informed me this morning that he only had 2d in hand, so our finances are in a very low state. \n\nMessrs. Dawson and Doutch sang \"Farewell\" and the choir joined in the chorus, which sounded very fine. The Sutton Bros. rendered \"Larboard Watch\" in a most pathetic manner. The choir then sang a few part songs and we brought a most enjoyable evening to a close by singing the National Anthem, I must apologise to \"Billsy May\" and \"Jacks\" for not mentioning them before as their items were among the most enjoyable.\n\nThursday 19th\n\nStan Wright and I got a pile of straw and made ourselves as snug as possible on the brick floor. About 1 a.m. we were rudely awakened by Serg. \"Benny\" who informed us that we were to arise at 5 and have Break. at 5.30 and be ready to depart. We got up at the time stated dashed down to the cookhouse in the pitchy darkness and through the mud and got our break of bacon and tea. After break we were informed that we were not going away till tomorrow, so we are all smiles again as we can do with a day’s rest, There is absolutely nothing one can buy here and the people are verydirty and unobliging. They have no time for soldiers at all, and almost seem to begrudge telling us the time. A number of us visited several farm houses before we could buy bread and butter and when did get it, we had to pay \"through the nose\" for it. The Cooks gear has been sent on, so we had to cook our own meat. We fossicked around in search of wood for our fire, I would’nt like to say where we got it from, but a little shed that was just outside our billet is not to be seen this morning. Dodson is cook and he gave us jolly good feeds. For Dinner we had grilled steak and boiled Potatoes for tea we had more steak chipped potatoes, and stewed apple and tinned milk, quite a glorious feed, considering we are so near the firing line. After tea we had another fine old sing song our choir has come on wonderfully and they sang the choruses almost like prima-donnas. \n\nAbout 9 Mac D.Alldiss and a party of machine gunners arrived and helped to swell the singing. Later on, more machine gunners came in and there was \"standing room only\" in our billet, so we drew the meeting to a close by singing \"Farewell\" One of the mob gunners gave us a sword dance the music being supplied by the crowd humming the Cock-o-the North\" in imitation of bag pipes. We all clubbed together and bought a few bottles of wine and after drinking this we went to bunk, tired and happy.\n\nFriday 20th\n\nReveille at 5.30 morning cold, wet, and damp, and dreary We tramped down, through the mud to our cookhouse for a drink of tea and some bacon. Then we rolled our blankets and \"fell in\" about 9 and marched about 2 ½ miles to where French motor buses were waiting to take us out to the trenches. They are fine big cars, each one carrying 30 men. Goodness knows how many cars there were, but they stretched out along the roads as far as the eye could see. The drivers wore big fur coats, and they needed ‘em too, as it was very cold. We passed through a number of pretty little villages until we got to Amiens. This is a fine big city, but we only passed through the outskirts. They have electric cars there, and as soon as our crowd caught sight of ‘em they cheered like mad. From Amiens we went to Dernancourt where we billeted for the night. On our way we passed motor cars and waggons of all kinds, thousands and thousands of ‘em I didn’t think there were so many in the world. We billeted at different farms in the village. A party of ten of us stayed at one place the smallest and best of the lot and we had plenty of straw to sleep on. The people are very cranky and don’t seem to have any time for soldiers. There were a few small shops around, but it was impossible to purchase anything, as they were all sold out before we arrived. Stan Wright asked the woman at the farm to make him a mess tin full of coffee. She did so, but most begrudgingly, without milk or sugar, and wanted to charge him a franc but Stan politely told her to keep it. \n\nThe transports had’nt arrived and as the cooks gear was on them we could’nt get any tea, and had to sit around in the cold, with slush up to our knees. Mac & I went up the town and purchased a bottle of red wine, which warmed us up a bit before we curled up in the straw and went to sleep.\n\nSaturday 21st\n\nThe SOMME.\n\nAbout 6 a.m., we heard a big roaring voice roar out\" Who’s in here\" \"B.Sec. Bearers\" we said, \"Well B.Sec. Bearers open this door. We opened the door and discovered the well known form of Capt. Irving who told us in forcible tones to \"show a leg\" we turned out and found the ground white with frost and all the water with ice on it. Our thick socks and mufflers are greatly appreciated. The thick ones M.S. sent me have saved me from many an attack of cold feet. We had Bacon and Tea for Break. and the tea tasted like water. We fell in about 9 and hung about till about 10. Then we marched or rather slowed through a few more miles of mud to the A.D.S. We passed innumerable troops on the road. Artillery Infantry, Cavalry and all kinds of soldiers. They brought about 14 of us along in motor cars as an advance party.\n\nSome of the infantry had their Fife and drum bands to play them from the trenches and they sounded very well. On our way we passed ALBERT where our fellows drove the Germans out of at the beginning of the \"Big Push\" There is a church there with a statue of the Virgin Mary on top. The German knocked the statue with a shell and now it lies in a horizontal position across the tower. It is gradually slipping down and the few country people about say that when it falls the war will end From now on the country is flattened out by artillery fire, and the ground is one mass of shell holes, not a building or a tree is left standing. Our engineers and Navy Battns. have made a road and also laid a Railway line almost up to the trenches. In places the road is in an awful mess, mud up to the horses bellies, and we almost had to carry the motor amb. over the worst spots. The shells are carried to the Guns by Pack Horses and there is a constant stream of them on the move night and day. The bombardment never ceases. \n\nHow these poor devils of infantry men stand the strain is beyond me. We arrived at the A.D.S. about 4.30 and very soon got outside some Bully Beef and Bread as we had not had anything to eat since about 7 a.m. just to our left is High Wood and to our right Belville Wood. Both the scenes of fierce fighting. There are thousands of graves about, with crosses made out of amm. Cases and any old timber available and most of them have hats or caps hung up also. The ground is shewed with shells, (both Germans and our own) rifles, coats, bayonets, overturned guns and last but not least we saw a tank. It was partly buried in self mud, and was an object of much interest to us. It is certainly beyond me to describe it, but is a very weird looking object and no wonder the Huns couldn’t make it out. It is driven by motor engines and instead of wheels, it has big caterpillars with which it clambers over trenches or any other old thing that comes in its way. The trees in the wood are without leaves or branches, and look just like so many old posts standing out of the ground. The 98th F.Amb. is carrying on the A.D.S. which we are to take over tomorrow. There are hundreds of aeroplanes about and they hover over Fritz’s lines as cheeky as sparrows. We are all camped in a big tent. The mud is ankle deep inside it, so we went over to the Amm. Dump and got a pile of empty cases to put on the ground. It made a hard bed but it was better than sleeping in the mud. The Corp. Cook of the 98th made us some cocoa for tea which was a great treat. We sat round his fire and had a good warm till he sent us off, then we went to Bed, Four of us slept as close as possible. First came Mac, then Myself, then Billsy May and lastly Roy Knowles. \"Billsy\" is nice and fat and kept us all warm. We didn’t get much sleep as the guns made such a terrific din, and at times fairly shook the ground. A few shells lobbed very close but nobody was hit.\n","336":" The Somme\n\nTurned out at 6 Had a snack of bread and jam and then 25 of us made away to the trenches. B.Sec. as usual leading the way. It was very cold but was fairly good walking as the ground was frozen hard. The bombardment never ceases, Guns are banging way day and night. As there were not enough of us to take over the posts the 98th came with us, and we had 2 stretcher parties 1 of the 98th and 1 of ours at each post. Stan Wright, Billsy May Snowy Atherton, and I went out to the furthest post, up near the trenches. We had an old German dugout for our quarters and considering it had gone through such a strenuous time, is in fairly good condition. Fritz can certainly show us points in making dug-outs. This one is about 30 feet deep, with steps right down to the bottom and there is room for about 8 men to sit or 3 or 4 to sleep. They are absolutely shell proof unless of course a shell lobbed right inside. How our chaps ever got the huns out is simply marvellous. We were told when we left H.W. that we would be relieved in 4 hours so brought no rations with us not even our water bottles. We never imagined it possible for anyone to suffer from thirst in this wet country. All the shell holes are full of water, but we are forbidden to drink it. About 2 p.m. a Reg. S.B. arrived with a note to send out 2 stretcher squads to the R.A.P. near the front trenches as the R.S.B’s were all knocked out. The Tommies \"bucked at the idea as their M.D. had given them orders not to go into the front, but as we had not been told anything about it, our party went along and the Tommies party came also. What a trip it was (so called) trenches are only 3 or 4 ft. high in places and the mud is up to the knees. We floundered along for about an hour. The poor devils of Infantry deserve all the praise for winning this war, as they live in regular hell every minute they put in the trenches. The path are very narrow and it is very difficult for 2 men to pass. The S.B. who was with us to the R.A.P. said \"this last 200 yds is very hot so when I give the word\" follow me for your lives\" Stan Wright was first, I was next and \"Snowy and Billsy came behind. It was a sprint of about 150 yds and we must have covered it in record time. The R.A.P. is an old Hun dugout, 2 stones deep and 3 or 4 rooms in each storey. A beauty. The M.O. was mighty glad to see us and was surprised to find out that we were Aus\". which of you is freshest? asked the M.O. We are Why? Said S. H. Wright. \"Never mind \"Why\" said the M.O. I’m just going to show you. Then he showed us our patient. Then he showed us our patient. A young guard of an Art. Office about 6 ft. and must have weighed about 13 stone. No wonder the M.O. asked \"who was the freshest\" Just outside the dug-out was a big pool of blood and one of the R.S.B’s informed us that a bearer had been blown to pieces there last night. So no wonder they were in such a hurry to get away. \n\nWe got our patient on the stretcher and started off along the sap. We struggled along for about 100 yds then we decided to go \"over the top which was well in sight of Fritz. The Lieut. Was shot through the Lung and was in great pain, poor beggar. We carried him shoulder high. The Tommies followed behind us with another stretcher case. Just before we left the R.A.P. one of the orderlies brought out a revolver and put on the stretcher. \"That’s not mine\" said the Officer. Right oh\" said I I’ll keep this as a souvenir. We got a long very well, dodging shell holes and wire like old hands. The Shells were bursting every where but we arrived safely and handed our patient over to Doherty Mac and Co. who carried him the next stage. He said \"do you leave me here and when we said \"yes\" he said \"Thanks very much\" as though he thought we’d done him a good turn by carrying him. We then returned to our dug-out where the Tommies made a bit of a fire. We hadn’t eaten anything since 6.30 a.m. and were jolly hungry. We fossicked around in the dug outs near by and discovered a lease of Bully Beef and a tin of biscuits, also a tablet of tea, milk and sugar. We found some water, besides to with this we had quite a decent feed. Billsy\" May and I went looking for Souvenirs and found several tins of tobacco, so we are right for a smoke now. There are a number of our big guns near us and Fritz keeps shelling around in search of ‘em. It is 5 o’clock now and no signs of our relief coming. Just before we had a snack and drink of \"so called\" tea we saw a fine dual between one of ours and a taube our side won and down came the Taube to the ground. A little while after another Taube came sailing over and our A.A. Guns scored a direct hit, and hit him fair in the middle. The framework came down to the ground in zig zag style and the wings were floating about in the air for a good few minutes before falling. It was mighty cold and we were almost finished. Our relief party arrived about 6 p.m. We were jolly glad to see ‘em and thought \"Oh we are right for a feed and sleep now, but we were awfully disappointed to find that we had to stay on till midnight at the next post. We got a few cases, and it was jolly hard work carrying through mud up to our knees. We can only travel a mile an hour and the poor devils of patients are on the stretchers for about 5 hours before reaching the A.D.S. It commenced to rain just before we left and the going was murderous. We kept falling out of one shell hole into another. Most of the holes are full of water and we all got wet through. The 14th F.A. relieved us and only arrived 2 hours late. It is about 3 ½\n\nmiles back to our A.D.S. and we arrived back there about 4 a.m. mud up to our necks and wet through to the skin. Serg. Hughes issued us with a good lot of rum which put new life into us. We got to the place where we slept last night, and found the tent pulled down and our packs and blankets out in the rain, so we had to crawl in under a stack of boxes which is used as a collecting station for wounded and slept there the \n\nbest way we could. The rum had made new men of us and we got quite cheerful and had some bread and jam. before turning in to sleep. The floor was wet and muddy so we spread a piece of roofing felt on the floor and Billsy Snowy and I turned in together. We had to sleep in our wet clothes.\n\nThursday 26th\n\nThe last few days have been one vast period of carrying patients through the mud. Pulling each other out of shell holes, and searching \n\nfor somewhere to sleep. This is about 12 mid day and up to now we haven’t had a decent feed or a sleep and everybody is dead beat. So many exciting incidents have happened that it is very difficult to think of them all. About 4 a.m. on Wed. we had just returned from our 8 hours duty (with a 2 hour walk either way) and we were lived up awaiting our Rum issue when a shell burst about 20 yds. away and smothered us all in mud. Something struck me very hard in the chest and I thought I was hit, I felt there and found it wet, I thought it was blood but on going to the light discovered it mud and not a \"Blighty\" the shell fire is terrific and never ceases night or day. It is murderous carrying patients at night it is pitch dark and at times only for the flash from guns and star shells we should get bushed or bogged in the mud. The times for changing shifts are getting altered and the 15th are relieving the 14th at 4 instead of 8 we met them on the way out. After getting our rum Snowy Billsy and I crawled into what we thought was a 15th dugout. No sooner had we settled down than 2 of the 14th returned, so of course we had to clear out and make room for them. It was drizzling with rain and our boots and pants were full of water and were mighty cold to put on. We crawled over to the cookhouse and lay down there all among the greasy dishes. On our way over we dropped our blankets in the mud and lost one, and it was icy cold. No sooner had we laid down than a whizz-bang came over and smothered us with mud, it was about 5 a.m. by now and we just got over this shock when the cooks came and turned us out so we finished our nights rest in the cooks dug out. We had to turn out again about 7.30 for Break. It is lovely? Turning out these cold mornings and putting on wet muddy boots and pants with mud up to the crutch. A drink of hot tea puts great head into a man. We were to be on duty from 12 a.m. till 6 p.m. There, and as it was a 2 hours scramble through mud and shell holes to get to our post we had to fall in at 9.30 to draw rations and we left the A.D.S. about 10. It is a good dugout at North Road, the same post we were at on Sunday. There were 16 men at each post. \n\nOn Tues. we relieved the 15th at Fleurs support where we were posted on Mon. and Tues. When we arrived we found them huddled up in an old gun pit, as they had been shelled out of the dug outs on Tues. Fritz dropped a shell just outside and dug up a couple of dead Indians. All along the track to the trenches are thousands of crosses. \n\nMonday 23rd to Thursday 26th\n\nA man is buried just where he drops and a cross put over it and either his shell helmet or a shell put there as a land mark. The ground is strewn with shells, rifles, bayonets overturned guns equipments etc. But it is useless to try and describe things here. Sometimes as we are struggling along with a stretcher case, a star shell will light up and the wooded crosses and dead bodies lying around make things look very weird. In spite of it all our crowd are keeping up heart wonderfully and although the humour is very grim, we can still manage to raise a smile. On Tuesday I got a very pleasant surprise by getting 2 letters and 2 papers from France which were mighty welcome. Poor old Mac is in a bad way because two of his patients have died on the way in. Things are mighty rough for us, but how the poor devils of Infantrymen stick it is beyond me. There are about 20 of our men sick and suffering from Shell shock. It is an awful strain on all of us. Doherty fell in a shell hole and rolled on a dead German and has felt very queer ever since. On Wed. night besides Serg. Roberts and 8 of us bearers we had Capt. Nance, Irving and a new officer in our dug out and it was very crowded. We are working in 6 hours shifts. 600 went on from 2.30 till 8.30 then we rolled in our blankets and tried to sleep sitting up but it was a dismal failure as it was so odd and Billsy, Snowy S.H. and I are 1 party and Mac Bert Hunt, Bluey Riley and Jack Keen are the other. Berry is in charge of the other 2 parties in the next dug out. It looked very funny the crowd wrapped in their blankets huddled in a heap to try and keep warm. \n\nThurs. was a quiet day, thank the Lord and we had it fairly easy. We made a fire and cooked some stew and made cocoa for dinner, which was a great treat. There are plenty of souvenirs about. Germans coats gas bags, bayonets and all sorts but is as much as we can do to drag ourselves through the mud without loading upwith these. I got a good water bottles, aluminimum which is much better than our issued ones, so I left my old bottle in the dug out and brought away Fritz’s It is very interesting to see our aeroplanes signalling to the different Batteries. They fly over Fritz lines and hover about, then all of a sudden they will come back \"Hell for leather\" and signal to the Battery, which immediately fills its guns and bangs away. Perhaps at a working party or any old thing which the airmen have seen. Fritz doesn’t leave his observation balloons for long, as \"planes soon get among ‘em and drop a bomb or put a few shots into ‘em.\n\nFriday 27th\n\nLast night we got home about 10 p.m. 2 hours later the 14th relieved us. They are doing 48 hours on we found a good feed of stew awaiting us and good hot tea, and how we tore into it. Besides this the men on duty in camp and made is a dug out so after a good tot of rum we turned into bunk. Joy Koller made a fire and the place was quite snug. We slept in till about 9 this morning. It was glorious to be able to take off our wet boots and pants, as we have had ‘em on since Sunday last. Joy brought us some Break. to Bed. Bacon and tea so here it is 12 midday and we are still in bed. We go on duty again at 6, for 48 hours, so we had better make the most of our spell. Our Putties and great coats are all caked with mud, so most of us have either discarded them, or cut the cots off at the waist. We wear sandbags, tied on with bandages, instead of putties, and when we line up on Parade present a very comical appearance. \n\nWe had a good feed of stew at 3 p.m. and fell in at 4, ready to march off to the different posts on our 48 hours shift, Serg. Roberts is staying behind as Orderly Serg. and \"Thomas\" came in charge of our party. It poured with rain on our way out and made us feel very cheerful and happy (I don’t think) We arrived at the \"Crest\" about 6, and relieved the","337":" who were mighty glad to see us. It is a good dug-out, one of Fritz’s with about 12 steps down to it. There are 27 in the party and we were very crowded. We work in 6 hours shifts, and as each party changes over, they change places with the crowd on duty and go to the down stairs portion of the dug-out. We have a party of Infantry attached to us as bearers and seven of them are with our party, Stan Wright went Home sick after carrying in one patient, so we had a big Inf. Chap in his place. The first patient we took over the top, but it was very bad going, so we took the rest of ‘em through the sap. In places it is up to the knees in water, and also is partly filled in with earth, but for all that it is much better than falling into shell holes. We were kept busy on our shift. At 12 mid-nt we changed over and went into the lower room, where we had a feed of B.B.B. and Cheese then we kuddled together and tried to sleep, but it was a dismal failaure. We had no candles, so on our way back from the next post, we called in at some A.H.Q and asked if they would oblige us with a few. They gave us 6, and we got a very pleasant surprise, when they handed round rum and tea to the party.\n\nSaturday 28th\n\nAbout 9, I took a stroll round in search of somewhere to make a fire. Came across an old dug out, which had a fire place made of shell cases, some fix wood, a tin of salt, and a bag of potatoes. I got a fire going, and with the assistance of Dodds & Reg Sutton we soon had a tea which was much enjoyed by the mob.\n\nA big No. of our bearers are sick or suffering from shell shock, so we had to fall back on the Nursing Sec. to give us a hand. \"Dodds\" and Jim Eldridge are with us, and a No. of others are with the other parties. We intended to make a stew for dinner, with B. but couldn’t find any wood for the fire. The Inf. Battns. were changing over this afternoon and Fritz had a sausage up. He very soon sent over a supply of shells and got quite a No. of ‘em. Two chaps came to our post, one with a foot blown off, the other with a piece of shrapnel through his chin and up into his mouth splitting the tongue. Capt. Irving fixed up the Jaw case, and \"Thomas\" fixed up the leg case in good style. There are guns everywhere and they are banging away night and day. There is a Battery on top of our dug-out and it is belching away while I am writing. Fritz is getting a bit of his own back now, as he never gets any peace from our gunners. They have an unlimited supply of shells and keep worrying him all the time. We had another smack about 3, then Capt. Nance arrived and said the party who were resting could come out to this Post \nNorth Road\n and relieve the 15th who have been on for 48 hours. Capt. Irving has a sledge going drawn by 2 horses, but I don’t know whether it will be a success or not. There are 15 of us in this dug-out and the place is crowded. Things are fairly quiet. It is now about 9, and we have only had 3 walking cases, so we are hoping there wont be any more till day light. On our way out, we passed another poor chap who was killed in the bombardment this afternoon. It is rotten not being able to write any letters. Poor old B.C. will be wondering what is wrong. Gee’ we’ve got an awful long time to make up for. It was awfully cold during the night, and we kuddled together like a lot of sick fowls, trying to get warm, luckily we had no cases, but No. 2 party were kept going most of the night.\n\nSunday 29th\n\nIt was about the most uncomfortable night I ever spent, and was very glad when daylight came. Then I got up and lit a fire and with the assistance of Roy Knowles made some tea, which put a bit of life into us. It rained very heavily and a bitterly cold wind was blowing. Fritz put over plenty of shrapnel, but our party were very lucky as usual. Every day a number of our chaps have to return to H.Q. with shell shock or other sickness. The strain on a man’s nerves is awful, and how the deuce our squad is sticking it I don’t know. It was very nice to sit by a bit of fire. Rations were very scanty and to improve matters the \"Big game\" is giving us a lot of trouble. We made a stew with Bully Beef & Biscuits, which with cocoa made a very good dinner. The fire took a lot of coaseing to make it burn, as the wood was very wet. We knocked a number of Amm. Cases to pieces for firewood. A No. of Infantry called in on their way from the front line and gratly enjoyed the cocoa we had. The 14th relieved us about 4 p.m. which gave us time to get back to \nGreen Dump\n in daylight. My heels were very sore and I dropped behind the crowd and after walking for about 2 hours I got \"bushed\" and struck some mud up to my hips. Luckily Frank Corrigan and a No. of others came along, and we assisted each other along. Fritz put a couple of Whizz-bangs\" over very close to us and splashed us with mud. When we reached Camp we were issued with dry socks and a lot of rum, both of which were badly needed. Then I got a copy of tea and some stew and we to our dug-out where Jack Keen had a good fire burning. It seemed like Heaven to take off our sopping wet clothes and turn into our blankets 48 hours is a long time to be out without sleep especially when rations are short. On our way Home we passed 2 horses that had got bogged in the mud and been shot. It is far beyond me to attempt to describe things, but it almost seems like a ghastly nightmare. \n\nMonday 30th\n\nWe slept very soundly till about 9, when the Cooks woke us up and said Break. was ready \"Blue\" Riley and \"Joy\" Keller got up and brought Break to Bed for the rest of us, which we greatly appreciated, Bacon and good hot tea. My word a drink of tea is good, these times. Jack Keen lit the fire and we stayed in our blankets for a while longer, as we were all very tired. None of us have shaved since we left \nStrazeele\n and we are beginning to look like scarecrows, so we made an effort and managed to shave before we went to dinner. We had dinner at 11 and \"fell in\" at 12, so as to relieve the 14th in good time. We came out to \nMc Cormacks Posst\n, which is that worst of the lot. Arrived here at 8 oclcok. The 14th did not expect us till 2. and were having dinner, so we had to buzz round in the wet and cold till they had finished. There were about 36 in our party with Capt Lloyd, Lorry Trousdale, and Serg. Roberts in charge, as there were not enough dug-outs, we had to \"turn to\" and dig one. Stan Wright, Billsy, Snowy Atherton and I are still working together, and we soon made a hole big enough for 4 of us, which we covered over with stretchers for a roof. Just got it finished when the Rain commenced to pour down and we were flooded out in a very few minutes, but we had to make the best of it. About 5 we were issued with rations, Bread, Cheese, and Bully Beef, but we couldn’t get any tea as it was too wet to make a fire. A No. of cases came along, which were taken on by the Horse Sledged 2 men have to go with the sledge, in case anything goes wrong, and it is almost as bad as carrying, is to follow the sledge, through shell holes up to the knees in mud and water. It poured in rain all night and we were over boot tops in mud in our dug-outs the rain was coming in too, so we had to sit there in our clothes, wet through to the skin and pray for daylight to appear.\n","338":" Oc.31st\n\nWe were mighty pleased to see the sun rise this morning, so that we could get out and stretch our cramped limbs. \"Snowy\" was very sick all night with pains in his stomach, and Stan Wright is near dead with a cold. Billsy’s back is bad, and I am feeling anyhow myself. So our squad is in a bad way. The Doctor sent Snowy, Joy Koller, and a No. of others back to camp, sick, so we are getting a smaller crowd every day. We took our first case in about 6 a.m. Billsy and I on the Sledge Jack McIlwain was riding the Horse. All went well till we came to a bridge over the sap, which broke and Mac and his mount fell into the sap. Billsy had a good grip on the sledge, otherwise the whole lot, patient and all, would have gone in. Some Inf. Chaps were near by and they gave us a hand to get the horse out. Mac hurt his knee a bit, so took the patient right through to A.D.S. We had a snack of B.B. Bread when we returned but couldn’t get a drink of tea, as it was not safe to light a fire, It was a beautiful clear morning and we could see the Church tower in Bapanme quite distinctly. Just after breakfast Fritz bombarded very heavily, and the shells were flying thick and fast around our dug-outs. A party of R.F.A. were just passing when a shell dropped right in amongst ‘em killing 3 and wounding one. Hippersly grabbed a stretcher and made over towards them, closely followed by Blue\" Riley, I was standing next to Blue, so had to follow him, although the shells were still flying. Billsy May also came along and we brought in one R.F.A. who was still alive, and one of our Inf. Chaps who got a nasty wound in the leg. The poor old R.F.A. man breathed his last, just as we got him to the M.D.’s dug-out. He was practically blown to pieces. The bags of rations were blown some distance away, but we managed to salvage a loaf and a tin of jam, which came in very handy as our rations were very low. The","339":" F. Amb. relieved us about 1 p.m. then we went on to Fleurs the next Post, where there is a good dug-out, which our squad soon took possession of. There are \n\nseveral batteries quite close and Fritz keeps on sending shells over in search of ‘em. A big crowd of Inf. were passing, and it was marvellous that no one was hit. Just before we left \nMcCormacks\n a \"dud landed almost in Dodde’s and Jim Aldridge’s dug-out and gave them a bit of a shock. Serg. Roberts is in our dug-out and while we were collecting stretchers and blankets from the","340":" he lit a fire and made some tea, and also managed to find a primus stove, which came in very handy. The \"Long looked for stunt\" is expected to come off tomorrow, that is why we are getting as many blankets and stretchers as possible. There were about 30 of our balloons up this evening and the ‘planes almost darkened the sky at times. Fritz had a couple of \"sausages\" up, but very soon hauled ‘em down when our ‘planes appeared. This is a snug little dug-out and we have just finished a feed and had a drink of tea, which was glorious. Now we are sitting back and having a yarn and smoke. We have a big Infantryman in our squad named Hargrove, 59th Batt. in place of \"Snowy\" Atherton. It is an awfully long time since we got any mail, and we are wondering when some will appear. We were mighty short of paper to start our fire, so I had to turn out my pockets and found 2 of Frances’ letters, but I’m sure she wont mind them being put to such good use. Yesterday a Captain walked past a gun and got his leg blown off. He died just as he reached our A.D.S. Every time we go along the road we see new graves. It is marvellous that there are so few killed considering Fritz sends over so much stuff. At times the air seems to fairly churn, owing to so many shells passing at once. Things are very lively and the cases come through almost too quick to handle. B. Sec. are working like tyrants a great many have broken down and only about half of us are left. We were very busy all night. A party of 60th Batt. men relieved the 59th as S.P’s, but after struggling out here in the dark, with full pack up, they were dead beat and were almost useless, but they did their best and no one can do more than that. \n","341":"\n\nThis morning about 2 a.m. one of the 60th men arrived and informed us that he had 2 stretcher cases some distance away, but they couldn’t get along any further as they were all dead beat, 2 squads of us went along with him and found them about a mile back dogged in the mud. None of them had slings and the poor patients must have had a very rough time, especially as one of them had a smashed thigh. We got them through to \nMacCormacks\n, and handed them over to the","342":" Chaps. We made a cup of tea and had a snack of B.B. & B. \"Billsy found a tin of \"Ideal Milk\" which made almost a banquet of it. Then things began to \"hum\" Fritz sent over his H.E. and shrapnel very thick and the wounded were arriving in a constant stream. There is a clump of trees near our dug-outs, right alongside the Road, and Fritz bombarded it night and day. Billsy and I were standing quite outside our dug-out when a shell exploded near Captain Wooster’s Dug out. After the smoke cleared away we saw a horse and man lying in the road. We grabbed a stretcher and went along. The horses head was practically blown off and the poor chap had a great hole in his neck, under the ear. We knew his case was hopeless so went up the bill a bit, where a machine gunner was lying. He was badly wounded in the leg and shoulder. A Sergeant went over to give him a hand and was blown to pieces. We patched up the Mch. Gunner with the assistance of a R.A.M.C. Chap (who was quite as good as M.D.) and carried him along to \nMcCormacks\n. We also took in Capt. Fanning 56th Batt. who was badly smashed up, but quite cheerful. It was quite the most exciting day we have had, and everyone is knocked up. Billsy May, Stan Wright, Hangrove (56) and myself worked together all the time. The 14th relieved us about 3 p.m. and we were jolly glad to see ‘em. We got back to Green Dump at about 5.30 and had a feed of stew and tea, which went down great. Jack Keen had a fire going and after our issue of rum and a smoke we \"turned in\".\n","343":"\n\nThe big were very active last night and very few of us had much sleep. May and Laycock were light headed and were passing remarks about the war all night. I wrote at daylight and lit my pipe. We enjoy a smoke very much these times. Break. Was on at 9, but we were too tired to go over for any. Stayed in bed and had some bread and butter. Blue Riley brought us a drink of tea, we \"turned out\" about 10.30 had a wash in a shell hole, then went over and had a feed of stew. There was a bag of bread scraps outside the cookhouse, which we raided like a lot of hungry wolves. Rations are, indeed very short We left Green Dumps about 12 and came out to McCormacks Post just before we left the cry went up \"Fall in for Mail\" There was a Holy Rush and as each man got his letters, a beautiful smile broke out and lit his face like sunshine. If only our people at Home could see a mail being distributed it would do their hearts good. I got 6 letters, 1 from France, 1 Mother, and 4 from M.S. and a Photo and P.C. Lord, it puts new life into a man to know the folks at home think of him.\n\nJIM LILLEY WOUNDED\n\nOn the way back to Green Dump after being relieved, the 15th F.A. lost 5 men, yesterday. Jim Lilley got a nasty wound, shrapnel clean through his helmet, and tore up the scalp, parting his hair and fracturing the skull. He’s pretty crook. We got out to McCormacks about 2 and got a good dug-out. MacD, has rejoined our squad in place of Snowy Atherton. Rass, Alec, Nuggett Bennett and Les Townsend, are also in our dug-out. Rass made a fire and we had some tea and a feed. B.B.& B. and a tiny quantity of jam. After tea we had a walking case \"Billsy\" and I, Beautiful moonlight night and we could pick our road through the mud, when we returned, I lit my pipe, and read my letters through a few more times. It is a fortnight now since we have been blocked from writing and the Lord only knows when we shall be able to write again. Poor old B.E, will wonder what is wrong. Ah well, we shall be able to make up for it soon, I hope.\n\nFriday 3rd\n\nAbout 2 a.m. we had just finished a drink of coffee and Biscuits, when 2 stretcher cases arrived, our squad had to turn out. The Moon had disappeared and a mist came down making the place pitch dark. We couldn’t see our hands in front of our faces. The patient told us he weighed 15 stone. In places the mud us up to our knees and we had to flounder through it. Several times we got bogged and had to haul one another out. It was a murderous carry and we were all dead beat on arriving at \nThe Crest\n Poor old Reg. Sutton came on behind us with the other patient. He had 3 Infantry chaps with him as bearers and they are almost useless, as after carrying their packs out to our posts they are dead beat. We crawled back to our dug-outs and almost collapsed from sheer exhaustion. It was frightfully cold and \"Rass\" and Alec saved our lives by lighting a fire and making some tea. We had one more case, but it was daylight then and we could pick our way better. We were having a snooze all kuddled together, when capt. Irving came along and set us on to dig a shelter for the Sledge horse, as the shells were flying pretty thick. The sledges are working well, but cannot be used at night as they cannot pick their way through the shell holes. We left McCormicks about midday and went to Goose Alley. This was a German stronghold and the number of dead men and horses still lying about, testify to the fierceness of the fighting. There are plenty of dug-outs about which Fritz built. It is very evident that he never imagined he’d be driven out, as some of the dug-outs are quite elaborate. There are great stacks of empty beer, wine, and mineral water bottles about, so Fritz must have been doing very well. The dug-out we occupied had straw on the floor and shelves to sleep on, so we were able to stretch ourselves out and have a good rest. We had 6 stretcher squads of 6 men each, and about 2 a.m. 6 stretcher cases came in all at once, so the whole crowd of us left and came back together a thing that has never happened before.\n","344":" \n\nIt was a fine morning and the going was fairly good. The 2 extra men makes all the difference. We got back to our dug-out and laid down for another hour, then we had a snack of B.B.&B. Alex gave me a tin of hot \"Maconochies\" which was quite a luxury. We took the last case away from \nGoose Alley\n Capt Phillips, 28th Bn. who was short through the leg by a sniper. Our squad also brought in the first case from \nNth. Rd. R.A.P.\n the chap whose revolver I got. We made our way back to Greens Dump through \nHigh Wood\n where we saw an enormous mine crator There were legs and arms and other bits of Fritz all over the place. It certainly was some hole. We also saw a number of big German Guns, which they had left behind in their hurry to get away. We got back to our B.A.D.S. where we got a clean shirt and pair of socks. Then we went to our dug-out and changed our shirts, which walked away as soon as we put ‘em down. After a feed of stew and some hot tea we returned between our blankets. The 14th and 18th are well away and so are our advanced party, but the poor old bearers have got to hang on till the","345":" F. arrive.\n\nSunday 5th\n\nYesterday when the","346":" relieved us at Goose Alley we gave a hearty sheer, as we thought we had done with The Somme, but here we are back again at \nRunners Posts\n 8 stretcher squads in charge of Sg. Thomson. They say our lads have gone \"over\" and gained their objective so we are looking forward to a lively time. It was very cold, an icy wind was blowing and if we had not been able to light a fire some of us would have died from cold. It is some time since we had a decent feed and many of us cannot look a tin of corned beef in the face. One good thing, the wind dried up the mud a bit and made it better for working, and walking along. The sledges did great work but it’s jolly had work chasing ‘em up. We tied our slings to the sledge, so that we could attend to the patient, and also assist over the bad places. Sometimes all the sledges were in use, then we had to carry in the usual manner. MacD. and I worked with Nugget Bennett, Alec, \"Rass\" and Les Townsend a good team. The wounded arrived in a constant stream and we were kept going the whole night, just as hard as we could go. The 6th F.Amb. were running the A.D.S. and their cooks kept an unlimited supply of tea and cocoa made, so we had a drink each trip we made, which was a great help. A no. of German wounded passed through our hands, who of course got treated just the same as our own chaps. No matter how badly a man was wounded, if only he could get a cigarette he was happy. Mac & I had just returned from taking in some walking patients, when we saw a shell burst in a gun pit about 60 yds. away from our dug-out, and a No. of bodies shot into the air. A stretcher party brought 2 of the poor fellows to our aid Post. One chap had his leg blown off and another chap was simply riddled with \n\nshrapnel. Serg. Thomson fixed him up and Jack Keen and I bandaged up the poor devil who lost the leg. He died soon after arriving at the A.D.S. The shell killed 3 men and wounded 2 so did some damage. One poor little chap of a German passed through. He only looked about 15 and his steel helmet seemed to be almost too heavy for his neck to support. The Huns must be getting might short of \"power feed\" A No. of German wounded were lying about, and it was fine to see the way our chaps treated \"em. A German Officer went through with a wounded hand and he seemed mighty interested in our guns. Good Lord one can’t move for Guns. Its one constant boom all day, and night never stopping. \"Thommie\" kept a fire burning all night and also made us cocoa and cooked some corned beef, so we did fairly well. Just after midnight it commenced to rain and made the tracks very slippery again. \n\nMonday 6th \n\nMac & I were taking a case in on the sledge when I lost my footing and was dragged through the mud for about 20 yds. which made Mac Smile. An Engineer Officer wandered into our dugout during the night. He was almost exhausted with the cold and mud and greatly appreciated our fire. He passed his water bottle round, which contained rum, also passed a tin of Egyptian Cigs. along, so he made himself a welcome guest. The cases kept on arriving and we were on the move all night. Daylight was never more welcome, as it was very rough, picking our way along in the dark. The 5th F.Amb. were to have relieved us yesterday but have not arrived yet. The poor old 8th are all day beat but continue with their good work. We struggled on till mid-day, when the 5th came along and relieved us. Went back to the A.D.S. where the Q.M. of the 6th gave us a stiff nip of rum, 6 of us brought in our last patient. Jack, Jim Eldridge a Mch.Gun Officer, 2 inf. men and myself. After that we returned to our dugout at Greens Dump, where Capt. Woods told us to get a drink of tea and our Rum issue and get between our blankets as there were no rations and our offices had all gone away and he didn’t know where to. We took his advice and turned in and were soon fast asleep.\n","347":" \n\nTurned out about 7. Had a snack of B.B.& B. and a drink of Tea and fell in. Never did the 8th present such a spectacle. Clothes in tatten, unwashed, unshaved (for a week) sandbags for puttees and greatcoats cut off at the pockets. About 30 of our men have been evacuated, so the poor old 8th are in a bad way. All our officers have bolted away for their lives and left us in charge of 3 strangers who seem very decent chaps. We paddled off through the mud and eventually arrived at a Rest Camp about 6 miles away from Greens Dump, near Fricourt. The 14th and 15th Nurses seem are running it, and the 15th bearers are also here. It was a treat to get under cover again, out of the rain. They stuck 30 of us in a big tent, also issued us with Cigs, and dry socks. Then we had some tucker B.B.& B. and hot coffee, which was great. They gave us stew and coffee for Tea and after Tea, another issue of rum, which was badly needed. On Monday a shell burst outside our cookhouse and wounded one of the 6th. They also lost 6 men at \"the crest\" just after relieving us, and lost 2 more last night so we must consider ourselves phenomenally lucky.\n","348":"\n\nLast night we slept well, as we had plenty of Blankets to keep us warm. A despatch rider dashed in during the night and took away Laycock \"on leave\" Lucky devil. It is pouring in rain. We had a very good breakfast Bacon, Jam, Tea, and actually bread. Now we are wondering whats going to happen next. The trumpets are \"in action\" at this camp and it seems quite like old times to hear the familiar calls. There are thousands of German Prisoners working on the roads about here. Wrote a few lines on a P.C. to B.E. but don’t know whether it will get through or not. Wish I could write a letter. Some rotter took my best pair of socks out of my pack and I only have one pair of socks left now. Rations are very short here. B.B. & B. is about all we have got. This is a Rest Camp. We are certainly giving our stomachs a rest. The rum issue is all there is to keep us alive. We had Dry Biscuits for Tea a few lucky ones had a little jam left from Dinner. After tea we had a bit of a sing song. We were just settling down to sleep when Bricky Howard, passed a rude remark to McDougall. We hopped out of bed to smack him and Bricky hopped out to repel the attack. Tim Mooney held the lamp, so they could see to smite each other. It was the funniest thing in the world and the mob roared with laughter. In the 2nd round Bricky’s underpants slipped down and tripped him. He also fell into the fire. On rising he threw his under pants off and carried on the battle stark naked. The battle lasted about 5 rounds, then the fighters went to bed.\n","349":"\n\nReveille at 7. Break at 7.30 Beans and Bacon and Biscuits we have almost forgotten what Bread tastes like. A party of us were road making. Bricky and I took a stroll into ALBERT about a mile away. It is in a bad way owing to the Bombardment. The Church is very fine - whats left of it. There are plenty of civilians in the town, who keep, small shops where one can purchase post cards and a few other things. We were almost broke but managed to rake up 6d to pay for 2 jam tins of coffee at a cottage. We visited the cemetery and saw a party of Canadians fixing up some headstones to the graves of their comrades. One Board had about 100 names on it officers and men. There are all sorts of soldiers in the town. Canadians, Scotties, African’s Australians Etc. We got back to camp just in time for dinner. B.B. & Bd. Potatoes. After dinner we did more roadmaking, about 3 Robby, our dashing Q.M. arrived conveyed the Cols greetings told us we were shortly to return to the firing line and took down a list of our equipment shortages, which was a mighty long one. They informed us we could write short letters, which is the most cheerful news we’ve had for a long time. For Tea we had tea and biscuits. Our clothes are beginning to hang very loose, on account of us losing weight.\n","350":"\n\n One year ago today I kissed M.S. goodbye, and the gallant 8th sailed from Melbourne. The heads informed us today that we could write short letters to which we all say \"Hooray\" as it is the biggest hardship of the lot not being able to write. I wrote a letter to L. the first one since \nOct.12.\n Poor old Girl will wonder what is wrong. We were roadmaking all day, which ought to keep us in good form for stretcher bearing. After Tea we had a sing song to celebrate the Anniversary of leaving Australia. \n","351":"\n\nMy poor old Diary has reached its last pages. Many a time I have been going to give it up, but now its full I am very pleased I stuck to it. I only hope it gets safely Home to M.S. for whom it is specially written. The dear old 8th have had some good and a few bad times, but this last few days has seen the worst time we have had. Our last 16 days on \"The Somme\" was an awful time, but we were very lucky in only getting one man wounded. I hope the Lord is as good to us when we \"go in\" again. This book has been with me every where and feels quite like an old friend, and I shall be quite sorry to part with it. If it reaches you in safety M.S. please take care of it, as it will be very pleasant, when I return to explain to you the parts of it, that you do not understand \"Au revoir\" old Book. I’m sorry to part with you, but hope to soon renew your acquaintance in dear old \"Sunny Australia. \n\n"}}
