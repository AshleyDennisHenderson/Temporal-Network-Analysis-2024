Fred Kitchen leading comedian.\n","52":" Paid Tommy a visit at 11.30 am & after a shave we dined together at Grand Railway Hotel.\n\nHe then showed me thro the Hotel which is a most beautiful place inside - almost a palace - 400 bedrooms. Saw later the Municipal Buildings, St Georges Sq & the G.P.O. & he left for Edinburgh.\n\nI got a ham & proceeded to Parkhead (Celtic Oval) & saw a Girls\n\nFootball match.

Very cold & snowing 35 degrees thermom.\n\nBack to town again & had tea at an Italian Cafe.\n","54":" Left Glasgow by 9am train & arrived Leeds at 3pm.\n\nDuring the trip I witnessed some very excellent scenery in the mountains as it had been snowing & the tops were covered in snow. I had some time to wait in Leeds before the Dewsbury train was due so contented myself with a run around town eventually having tea at Grand Hotel in Boar Lane.\n\nCaught 4.10 train to Dewsbury & was extremely surprised at the size of the place My intentions were to find dad’s relations John & Wm Newsome. Fred & Wm Harker & Mrs Ann Harker so sighting a newspaper office I made enquiries but in vain. Passing G.P.O. I found in Leeds Rd a Joe Newsome (grocer) & we had a good chat but apparently not same family. I accepted their kind invitation to stay to tea & had an excellent repast.\n\nAt night journeyed to Bayswater & met Bill Cunningham’s Sister Kate & we dined together Back to Aldwych.\n\nSupper & bed.\n\nmight add that Mr Green came to see me in Dewsbury this morn & he has promised to make enquiries.)\n","55":" Spent morning on writing.\n\nAfternoon met a heap of our boys just arrived from France & thence to Palladium & saw a variety show.

Arrived St Omer at 5 pm & billeted in Vet Barracks for night Allowed leave in the town until 9pm & with Archie Martin we went for a wander. After a good tea put in at a Picture Show - no good - thence to Pierrot Show - worse\n\nWent to bed with order to awake at 3 am.\n","58":" Up at 4am & had a cold couple of hours waiting for our train to push off Subsequently we moved at 8 am & the train simply crawled to Devres - our destination. There we were lucky enough to meet one of our ambulance cars & got a lift - 8 Kilos - to our unit where we are soon at home again.\n","59":" In afternoon a small party of us hoofed it to Devres to have a look over then town & spend rather a pleasant afternoon Cpl Macauly who had recently rejoined us was one of party. Harry Tupper was with us again also\n","60":" Commenced work in earnest & did a morning route march\n\nAfternoon - pay & NCO parade.\n\nWe are at present in the village of Brunembert northeast of Devres.\n","61":" Another route march in morning.\n\nIn the afternoon I was instructed to carry on with the sanitation of camp.\n","62":" Last few days have been exceptionally warm.\n\nFootball training at night.\n","63":" Raining & cooler\n\nBridge game at night.\n","64":" Football Committee meeting.\n","65":"\n","66":" St Patricks Day.\n\nAt 10 am Snowy Woodham Dick Gates & self left Camp & proceeded on leave for day to Boulogne where we arrived at 2pm.\n\nDinner at American Restaurant & thence to Esplanade where a France band was playing. Hopped a rattler & lobbed at Wimereaux at almost 3.30.\n\nCalled at No 2 Aust Genl Hospl & saw a few of our old boys, inc Geo Jackson Cec Matthews & Glennie. Inspected a couple of wards.\n\nBack to Boulogne & had very nice at same joint.\n\nThence walk up to the Rue de St Paul and had a glance at the houses of ill fame there. and the Sights one sees there makes one disgusted with the business & we thanked God that these places do not exist in our native land. Back to Brunembert soon after -\n","67":" Early in\n\nmorning rumor had it that we were to move off at 2pm for an unknown destination & soon this proved correct & all was bustle & excitement.\n\nIn spite of fact that above seemed quite o.k. we discovered during the morning that same was only a practice move & not quite as much interest was taken as time wore on. However at 2pm we pushed off with full gear up & as the afternoon was hot we soon raised a good lather.\n\nHalfway to Desvres the whole were \"about turned\" & we tumbled to the stunt & felt pleased that the thing was only a stunt.We eventually bivouacked the night on a small piece of ground about 1 kilo from Brunembert & spent a fairly good time.\n\nUp at 6.30 & returned to Billets.\n","68":" Raining all day. Did some letter writing\n","69":" Rained all cleared away.\n\nBath Parade in morning\n\nBEGINNING OF GERMAN OFFENSIVE\n\n & good one too.\n\nAfternoon Football practice.\n","70":" At night after a very strenuous football training we were given a concert by 35th Batt Concert Party in the Recreation Room & very good.\n","71":" Got quite a shock at 3am where we were all disturbed by the unpleasant news that Fritz had launched his long looked for offensive we were to move up into the lines that day.\n\nWe therefore arose at 5 am very solid preparation in clearing up followed. After a short rest during the morning we moved off from Brunembert at 8pm & after waiting all night at Bottinghaus eventually entrained at am next morning feeling very done up.\n","72":" We learnt today that the enemy offensive had so far not been successful & that we would probably not have much to do\n\nat present.\n\nArrived at Caestre where we detrained still feeling weak & tired & then followed a long tedious march with our full kit (minus blankets) to well - goodness knows where.\n\nMarching all the afternoon passing through Godeswachsweld & Becke we reached Watou at nightfall & put up in the town for night with the prospects of another heavy day tomorrow.\n\nPlanes bombing thro night but slept well.\n","73":" Moved out of Watou at 9.30am had quite a march before we were picked up by motor lorries & was soon being whisked along another stage of journey. Passing Abeele we continued on thro Hazebruck & there saw some very large shell holes close to our roadway & the railway line.\n\nWe eventually left the lorries & after a short march arrived at that\n\n \n\ndays destination & billets in Wallon Capelle.\n\nThe billets were very comfortable & we were soon comfortable.\n\nIn the night we could hear the enemys naval gun shelling again.\n","74":" Arose 8am and during the morning received some very unpleasant news from Colonel who informed us that the enemy had broken thro to Bapaume & we would be in action very shortly He also gave us final instructions re medical matters. \n\nAt night we had an excellent feed of eggs & peas & felt set.\n","75":" Up again at 8am, & spent the morning in making preparations for another move - making our pack lighter as light as possible. In afternoon we pushed off about 4.30pm & entrained at Morbecque Steenbenque eventually leaving at 9pm.\n\nTravelled in train all night.\n","76":" Arrived at Doullnes early this\n\nmorning & saw the effects of a bomb dropped near the station.\n\nMarched some two or three kilos out of town - where saw traffic going all directions - guns & men transport etc.\n\nHeard all sorts of contradictory rumours from the front.\n\nCamped in paddock until 5pm when the infantry were moved up in buses to the line. We however had to walk about 15 kilos & set out about 5.15pm. Passing thro several villages Teramsnil being one. (where we saw some Yanks) we continued up to Pushevilliers arriving about 9pm & had to bivouac in the paddock the night.\n\nThe Naval Division were coming out at the time.\n\nQuite a number of us were lucky enough to put up in a barn for the night & slept fairly well.\n","77":" moved out to Pushvilliers at about 1 pm & marched some 10 kilos thro hilly country to Betancourt & had to pitch a camp there as it was then raining. We hadn’t been there very long before several shells came whizzing across\n\n & burst closely.\n\nLater in the night some shrapnel shells burst over us doing no damage & this continued throughout the night.\n\nWe think we are now about 3 miles from front trenches.\n","78":" Someone informed us that it was Good Friday today but none of us could recognise it as such. Weather improved a little this morning.\n\nOrders to move came at 1pm and in half an hour we are on the way.\n\nafter 11\/2 hrs march we arrived at Franvilliers where we were to all stand by until called on.\n\nFrom Franvilliers we had a good view of the battlefield & could trace the front line for about 10 miles circle half circle in front of us.\n\nIt was a good sight to see our shells & guns going their hardest & occasionally the enemy’s shells could be seen bursting not far from us. Word came sooner than expected and we had no sooner begun a game of cards when 20 \n\nbearers from our own section were urgently needed to support our Brigade about 12 miles south of us. In 15 minutes we were all ready to move & soon the party in charge of Capt Maclean was being carried by lorry to the scene of action. We were told that it was a risky adventure as it was quite possible that Fritz had overlapped our roadway before we passed the danger zone.\n\nIt was a long journey & after about 2 hours we passed thro a very nice town called Corby on the Somme.\n\nWe beat Fritz by taking another road & eventually arrived at Cashay which we were from which village we were told Fritz was only 200 yds. Things however seemed fairly quiet except for occasionally shells & our guns also had a hand.\n\nOur brigade was handy & as nothing could apparently be done then we were sent back 3 kilos to village of Gentelles. \n\nWe soon made ourselves at home & it was pitiful to visit some of the homes that the inmates had left in a hurry - sometimes leaving their meals on the table.\n\nThroughout the night things got very lively & shells burst all round us. Lay down at 3 am.\n","79":" \n\nDid not sleep much as the noise of scrap was too much & at daylight planes of both sides were very busy. \n\nThe enemy’s artillery seemed to be very much reinforced too. \n\nHANGARD WOOD BATTLE\n\nShells continued to rain in one end of village during morning but none fell near us. After dinner word came for about three squads of our C section to proceed forward to our advanced posts & our squad was included in the party.\n\n(Squad consisted of Dick Gates, Snowy Woodham McCure & self.)\n\nWe pushed off to the A.D.S. in rain in company with a couple of squads from A Section. Left some men at ADS Cachay and we then pushed further forward.\n\n \n\nOur squad were to take up position in the former post & en route we left bearers at the different relay posts.\n\nThe road at first was good but later it opened out into a quagmire & even ordinary walking was a difficulty.\n\nDuring the journey we passed several batteries of medium sized guns & all along the flat cavalry was in position apparently ready for favourable opportunity to push home an attack which was impending.\n\nIt was very misty.\n\nAfter about an hours walk we arrived at R.A.P. which is in the corner of Hangaard Wood. On the Just across the flat in front of us we could see the village of Hangaard - in possession of enemy, and on our own left was a very large town called Villiers Bretoneaux - constantly under shell fire.\n\nOur reception at R.A.P. was rather a lively one as heavy shells were bursting with an awful clap on our right, making our position\n\nprecarious.\n\nNo sooner had we arrived than patients came en galore for us & a couple of hours extremely heavy work was the result. It was the heaviest bearing I had done to date and every step we sunk into mud half way up to our knees.\n\nThe relays were insufficiently manned & our two carries had to be made practically the whole distance - some 3 miles.\n\nAs it was getting dark we sent word down to Capt Maclean to send the horse wagon up a little as we could have not have continued otherwise.\n\nPerc Kelly of our boys (now a lieut) was one of our first patients - shot thro lung.\n\nThings got so hot that on three occasions we had to shift position of the Aid Post and the wood on our right got a particularly torrid time.\n\nI mentioned Aid Post but it was simply a piece of ground marked out for purpose &\n\nabsolutely no shelter of any kind within cooee.\n\nAt about 3 in afternoon the 33rd Batt made an attack but did not do much good except perhaps to inflict casualties on the enemy.\n\nRain commenced again after dark & we were all wet to skin & covered in mud.\n\nThe ambulance wagons however received the pressure and our bearing was continued under more favourable conditions.\n\nThe cavalry retired later after losing some horses.\n\nFeeling just about done up we continued on until near morning but also the 34 Batt made another attack this time with success & sent the enemy back a little taking several prisoners.\n\nAt 7 am our battalion was relieved and it was about as much as we could do to drag ourselves back to Cachy where we got some bread & jam - it tasted like a feast. \n\nThe wagons took us on to Gentelles where we \n\ngot the mud off & dried our clothes a bit & later had an hours sleep. B section bearers in the meantime going up with another of our battalions.\n","80":" Had a good an hours sleep & awoke to hear the enemy shelling the village heavily & some shells went very close to us.\n\nDid not do much work.\n","81":" Had a decent sleep & souvenired some food & the boys made a decent meal.\n\nVillage again shelled heavily & artillery on both sides exceptionally active.\n\nOnly stray squads required for Aid Post work & we continued our rest.\n","82":" Enemy again shelled our village of Gentelles - rather heavily & five of our boys were wounded. John Perry (arms & scalp) H.G. McLean (leg) - rather severely. Mackay Jim Siggers & Chas Wynn - not quite so bad.\n\nThings got qui so \n\nlively during the day that we had to evacuate the village and so were ordered to Boues where our Dressing main Dressing Station was. Even on the road we were not safe & a long range fell uncommonly near our party.\n\nSlept well.\n","83":" Spent the day cleaning up & bathing in the river. Had a view round the district from chill just outside the town & at night saw a heavy barrage on a \n\nVILLIERS BRETONNEUX \n\nneighbouring wood.\n","84":" Awoke at 6 am to hear shells pouring into the village - this continued until about 9.30 am & considerable damage was done. Consequently we were ordered to other end of village to new billets. Soon after dinner I was ordered to proceed up the line again & on arrival at A.D.S. was greeted with a hail of whizz bangs & this was kept up for some time getting some Tommys on the roadway.\n\nAt 5pm a party were \n\ndespatched forward to an R.A.P. (34 Batt) & was going our hardest. Earlier in the afternoon a shell had lobbed on the RAP site & killed a bearer & wounded another.\n\nCarrying was very heavy & we as it was raining again we were soon wet through. Fritz attacked heavily that night & 36 Batt made their famous bayonet charge later. Things quietened during the night & towards morning our battalion was moved round to the right to Villiers Brettoneaux & we followed at 6am.\n","85":" Had to dodge thro a strafe to get to the RAP in the town & we soon saw that Villiers Brettoneaux was not a healthy place to be in.\n\nWe were forced to make our digs in a cellar & after an hour or two we felt a little drier. At 10 o’clock the town was strafed very heavily & at least 4 shells hit an Aid Post covering us with brick dust & bricks \n\nWe however got our patients down to the wagon safely & at 3 o’clock we began to realise that no rations had arrived. So a couple of us looked round for some tucker. Found some potatoes rice etc & cooked some for boys & had a good meal.\n\nAfter dark the 2nd Aust Div began to arrive & we jumped with joy at the idea of being relieved.\n\nI however feel in for a job to remain behind with the mo. in the woods.\n\nAt midnight we pushed out of Villiers Brettoneaux & had a very heavy march to a wood from three Kilos away.\n\nSlept about 11\/2 hrs & awoke feeling done up.\n","86":" Another march & we took up position in a gully from which position I was despatched to find the ambulance & establish communication.\n\nAlthough very tired & washed out I had to walk 6 or 7 kilos before I found the ambulance & was greeted with the good news of a relief.\n\nSpent afternoon resting. Slept well.\n\nOur unit hospital is on Amiens Rd nth of Boues.\n","87":" All the French papers are going into ecstasies over the defence of Villiers Brettoneux & it is the general opinion of the Tommies that they ran enabling the Germans to make their great advance.\n\nFritzs planes paid us a few visits & dropped a bomb or two without damage.\n\nNaval guns are tearing it in todays and we seem to have quite a lot here.\n\nA barrage just after dark was a picture. About midnight the planes were over again bombing (Mac and I volunteered to souvenir some potatoes at Gentelles.\n","88":" To Boues and back.\n\nRaining.\n","89":" At 10 am our squad left for A.D.S. - went Amiens Rd & arrived without incident.\n\nImmediately after we were established Fritz shelled the roads pretty severely and caught horses, etc. Throughout the day our position was shelled & at night-time Gas was sent over of which we got a taste - feeling rather sickly after it. As there was a spur on our right we got the rest & towards morn rain came.\n","90":" Towards morning we were ordered to take up another position about 100 yds down the road as Tommy infantry had moved in on our position. We subsequently worked all day hard - Capt Davies included - in re-establishing themselves. Otherwise position was quiet.\n","91":" At 10 am a party came to relieve our squad & we returned to our HQ on Amiens Rd nth of Boues.\n\nDuring the afternoon enemy planes dropped bombs closely & also at night just before more bombs were dropped.\n","92":" A French plane came down in field nearby after being over enemy country. At midday an enemy photographic plane was brought down from great height by some American planes. Paid a visit to the plane in the field (French) and saw a naval gun firing.\n\nRevisited our tents today.\n\nEnemy planes have been very fair to our portion of the country & not one bomb has so far been dropped near us.\n\nBombing again.\n","93":" Resting\n","94":"","95":" Weather very dull.

One against Shearman who always had a habit of strutting about with a RFC cap on. \n\nA Fritz plane which was brought down at Glisy attracted Shearman & when the RFC chaps arrived to salve the thing they began handing Shearman several important parts of engine. In this way Shearman earned some good souvenirs. Another is told against myself. On During our stay at Villiers Brettoneux I souvenired a for Froggie cap. Today a French plane came in on a Tommy field & visitors began to inspect it. One night when I was over with my Froggie cap & no tunic a Tommy major & his SM came across & addressed me\n\nParley vous Anglais monsieur. I answered Non messieurs & pointing to the French mechanic I said ‘the Pilot. He eventually asked the Frenchie if I was the French Officer & the French said Non les Australie ‘ave kamerads chapeau. I needless\n\nto say kept dark especially when the major said I needn’t have said told him I couldn’t speak English if I was an Aussie.\n\nAnother yarn of Jock Smith in Villiers He & a couple of others went to the mayors house during the shelling & discovered a sliding lift for tucker, etc. Sending the lift down he sang out Eggs & chips two please & made to walk away. But lo an answer came up the lift Hullo coming up: & later said it was the best we can do at present. The lift appeared with a bottle of wine and some cheese in it.

No planes have been bombing Amiens the past few nights & in view of the fact that it has been beautifully moonlight this seems strange. The fact of balloons being up at night may explain the mystery. \n\nTuesday 21st Swimming in afternoon - had a good afternoons sport in the baths.\n\nWith Yankees again at night.\n\nDuring the night Gotha bombed Allonville & killed 3 10th Fld Amb boys & wounded about 14 others.

This of course took us a couple of hours as we accompanied our Batt - the 35th - and both the infantry & us were well laden. We had stretchers & blankets to juggle in addition to our own stuff. As a route we took ‘B’ back. Passing through Aubigny Fouilloy & Hamelet we left Hayes Post behind & a little later got among some shells but no damage\n\nBEGINNING OF OUR HUGE OFFENSIVE\n\nwas done. Leaving Hamel on our left we crossed some very open spaces Subjected to machine gun fire & eventually arrived at the hopping off position where we took up our positions until the barrage. It was very unsatisfactory being a sunken road & communic. trench and therefore liable to draw fire.\n\nWe however rested here a couple of hours without incident.\n","171":" One of the most exciting & adventurous days of my life.\n\nTowards 4 am a heavy mist came up shrouding everything. At 4.5 am aeroplanes came over. We knew they were ours altho we couldn’t see them. Sounds of tank engines was thickly drowned by the planes.\n\nAt about 5 minutes to zero - (4.20) I left a trench I was occupying to put my gear in a place where I could find it afterwards on the sunken road and had no sooner done so when heigh Presto & gee the heavens opened up in flame & we knew at once our barrage had begun. We couldn’t see very much & wondered if the Tanks had succeeded in getting in possy. Afterwards we knew\n\nthey had though a couple got lost in the fog. To make things worse our smoke bombs made it impossible to see more than 10 yds anywhere. Five minutes later Fritzs barrage came down on us like a ton of bricks & our cover was scanty. We were covered in mud several times & one piece of shell caught me in knee doing no damage Nearby Freddy Lee got a piece in the arm & was out of action. Fifty or so shells must have burst within 40 yds of us without doing much damage & about an hour after the barrage I became anxious to know if our boys had got thro. Then the wounded began to arrive & the prisoners in scores. We souvenired some prisoners to carry for us but not before we had made one trip to RAP & got lost for 5 minutes in fog. Eventually we found the RAP - near Veare wood.\n\nSoon we heard the good news - that our objective was gained & although we had plenty of wounded to look we noticed the 4th Divvy going thro us to carry on the advance. The enemy guns were gradually becoming silent too.\n\nAfter fixing up the wounded\n\nhere we moved up behind our battalion - passing over Fritzs front line noticed some dead Germans & other things also droves of prisoners still coming back.\n\nWent thro the enemy outfit & discovered one who was only wounded & sent him back with some other Fritzs. Reached an RAO & got some stuff.\n\nLater we pushed right forward to our Batt some 4000 yds in front of old front line. Several Tanks were there too.\n\nWe could plainly see the heavy shelling for village of Cerisy on our left & also Warfusse - captured by us on our right.\n\nThere we dug in & slept well.\n","172":" Awoke at 8am after breakfast went across to 33 Batt for our ration They were near Warfusse. Whilst there we were shelled with a rubber gun but escaped OK.\n\nIt is very noticeable the sanitary conditions here dead Fritzs left unburied for weeks also horses. Examined a battery of guns left in his haste & also ammunition. Found 6 tins of Havelock tobaccies but how he got them we don’t know.\n\nThe Batt remained on this possy all day.\n\n \n\nAt 7pm a heavy barrage opened on our left flank & we tipped that we were making a hit across the river. The barrage continued for a couple of hours.\n\nSince yesterday morning we have advanced about 15 kilos here, capturing 18,000 prisoners over 200 guns. Corps H.Q. Railway gun & other things.\n\nBombing by Gothas at night.\n","173":" Rested all day - inspected a couple of planes down nearby - one a Fritz who was downed by an American who also lost his plane by following the Fritz down. He however escaped with slight injury. \n\nNear dark we moved up again into the front area with 35the Batt marching about 5 kilos passing Morcourt we arrived at our R.A.P. in dark. Soon after arrival the Gothas came across & gave us a deuce of a time bombing everywhere in our vicinity.\n\nThe 12th Field Amb were in possession of the dugout we were allotted & as they were not moving out for a couple of hours we slept upstairs. The line of dugouts we were in were old Fritz outfits & in the advance he had quitted in a hurry leaving behind a QM Store\n\n & canteen beside other stores.\n\nAbout 1000 yds away he had evacuated a hospital completely equipped & we recaptured about 300 stretchers which we had abandoned (the British I mean) in the March retreat. On the march up to our positions we passed score of big guns captured from the enemy - one set in particular were large ones said to have fired on Amiens - 6 inch naval.\n\nSome 5.9s we had turned round & were firing at him with his own stuff.\n\nAt any rate he sustained a number of casualties near the captured Hospital with bombs - including 12 horses.\n","174":" We had to carry across to near Peronne - Villers Brt Rd to Hospital with our wounded & today had a tout de suite journey. He was using his naval shrap gun across our track.\n\nAgain at night he strafed badly & had us ducking about some. Once more the Gothas came over & simply emptied their bombs in our valley.\n\nTonight we advanced the line 1000 yds & the 11th Brig surrounded a village - capturing no prisoners. At midnight we were disturbed & informed to prepare to move out any time now & so packed our belongings together\n\nin anticipation.\n\nAt 4 am we got a carry across to Hospital & orders came for us to proceed back to a wood nr Warfusse - Lena Wood.\n\nMonday 12th Marched back to Lena Wood examining big guns en route. arrived in time for breakfast.\n\nPrisoners for this stunt increased to 21000 & guns over 200.\n\nThree enemy planes brought down nr our wood.\n\nRested during morning.

But the climax came when passing thro a gully a cartload just missed us\n\n & the Battalion went a flat as a pancake. Luckily no one was hit.\n\nWe eventually passed thro Hamel & after 3 hrs of it arrived at Veare - looking very different & bivouacked for the night.\n","176":" Not much doing today. left resting - bath etc. Towards night orders came to rejoin our units & we pushed up with Staff Carr.

Taken to the unit HQ at Sailly-le-Sec and slept for remainder of night.\n","184":" Swim & clean up in morning & at 1.30 pm we (all bearers of B & C Sections) marched out in sweltering heat & dust & made Sailly Laurette our first stop.\n\nOur squad on this occasion were not in the advance party for the line on\n\nfirst time since stunt began for the Divvy & we moved up to a Reserve Bearer Post to rest until called for.\n\nHowever we did not rest long although we slept little.\n","185":" At dawn our barrage opened & thoughts of At 7.30pm wounded began to arrive & we summed up that our boys were meeting with solid defences & also discovered that the enemy knew of the hop over Consequently the casualties were high.\n\nA hurried breakfast & then - five of our boys came thro wounded & visions of Passendale & other stunts came to mind \n\nETINGHEM\n\nWe were soon whizzing up to the scene of action & the shelling showed that Fritz had plenty of artillery here.\n\nAt 9pm we established a relay on the road between our R.A.P. & Etinghem - rather a bad spot.\n\nAn hour later we moved up further - establishing a relay in a sunken road on left of Etinghem & about 200 yds from advance RAP.\n\nThere we carried on all day without 5 minutes spell & at dusk Fritz shelled like hell - particularly the village below us. This necessitated our carrying overland along the hill to\n\nETINGHEM and BRAY\n\nour ADS \n","186":" We were still carrying at midday though things had eased off.\n\nDuring the afternoon we moved up again to RAO and there established ourselves at night dark.\n\nHad not been there very long when 40 Batt told us of a hop over to get Bray- right in front of us & despite the fact we were done up we had to do the carrying.\n\nSleep was out of the question for the RAP on our left continued to bring us cases until at 1am our barrage burst forth & soon the boys were on the move. \n\nThen we commenced work again in earnest & carried about 4 cases each before prisoners began to arrive & relieved the strain a bit.\n","187":" The boys got Bray all right - surrounded it.\n\nWe had nasty experience with some 8 inch stuff but no damage.\n\nYoung Rochford of A Sect was killed yesterday on our left.\n\nWas pretty busy until midday & some of us lazed for an hour.\n\nAt 3pm we were ordered to have a sleep nearby. At 7pm we were relieved by A Sect bearers after being about 60 hours without \n\nsleep or rest.\n\nWe proceeded to Quarry A.D.S. & was soon asleep bombs in galore causing numerous casualties among Tommy artillery but we missed it.\n","188":" Still at Quarry. On awaking my left eye was closed - bitten by an insect - & I had to have the thing bandaged. Still another barrage at 2 am & our boys still going well beyond Bray - did not meet many Fritzs.\n\nThis morn Light Horse sent thro. \n\nIn the afternoon we moved up again well beyond Etinghem this time & dug in - in a quarry used as a loading post. A couple of anti’s belted out soon after our arrival & knocked stones etc everywhere.\n\nOur squad were detailed as loading party & near midnight a heavy storm drenched everything.\n\nHowever we managed some sleep but in morning my right eye was settled by something & my left being not much use I felt uncomfortable.\n","189":" As I was almost blind Staff Carr sent me down on a horse to Chipelly MDS for some treatment & I reached there about midday & soon began a treatment which\n\nimproved the eyes. The doc said that I had been bitten by insects & would soon be OK again.\n\nMet Bert Forrest towards night.\n\nBen Taylor, Birch, Stuckey & Flood came through wounded.\n\nGothas at night - but slept well.\n","190":" Slight improvement Did nothing but rest. Showery.\n","191":" Very much improved. Ken Milton came down line to go on leave. Left our boys in Chateau at Suzanne. All OK.\n\nWeather improved.\n","192":" Excellent weather. Resting.\n","193":" Up at 4.30am & on the move soon after en route to Suzanne to open MDS there. Passed thro Ettinhem & Bray - the latter place not much knocked about but Fritz had cleared out almost everything of value - even furniture. However near Bray goods yard we saw some very large ammunition & engineers dumps which he had to leave in his retreat. Some 8 inch naval shells were pearls. Timber was in abundance.\n\nThe country here looked excellent for defense works & it speaks volumes that it was captured with such small losses.\n\nPassing Cappy on our right we passed several ammunition dumps & arrived at Suzanne at about 9am.\n\nBut sad to relate I learnt some very bad\n\nnews here for during my absence my squad had been knocked about - Snowy Woodham being killed & Dick Gates badly wounded. Also Sullivan, Bill Howard wounded Wagstaffe slightly & Geo Street of 10 Fld Amb killed. Happened near Curlu. I was considered still not fit for bearing & given a clerks work at main Dressing Station Suzanne.\n\nLater receive\n\nWounded coming thro fairly thick.\n","194":" On awakening I was greeted with more bad news - that three of our boys had been killed by a big shell near Clery. Josh Gibson went away from the square to find a decent track & when he returned it was to find that Wilf Boyes & Albert Clarkson had been killed instantly & Rabinovitch so badly that he died later.\n\nToday was one of the busiest I have seen & wounded simply poured in. Our boys had been trying to get Mount St Quentin to dominate Peronne. A goodly number of prisoners also came thro.\n","195":" Heard on good authority that Abel Sheath was killed on","196":" 8 Batt hop over -\n\nCapt Maclean went thro with wounded arm - good oh\n\nToday was even busier than yesterday and we\n\nhadn’t a spare moment all day. Some very bad wounds. Over 100 wounded Fritzs made things awkward too. However toward night things quietened & we received the news that our boys had got Peronne\n\nMonday 2nd Not quite so busy\n\nSome prisoners went through here & did the goose-step past Divisional HQ. It was caused quite a commotion. The news of our boys being in Peronne was confirmed today, also the storming of Mont St Quentin.\n","197":" Visited Suzanne Cemetery & saw Snowy Woodhams & Rabinovitchs graves also Geo Street. Also all buried beside each other. Will Boyes & Clarkson buried at A.D.S.

Bombs during Pierrot show.\n","198":" Our MDS converted into a Brigade Hospital.\n\nGood news from north. captured 10000 prisoners.\n","199":" Bath & clean up etc.\n\nAt night all the bearers moved up to Curlu but I was omitted & ordered to remain until morning.\n","200":" After breakfast we pushed off on a long march towards Peronne. Travelling cross country we arrived by bad roads at Curlu - which the Hun had used as a CES, well dug in. There we passed the bearers & as we advanced a little further we had a good view of old 1916 battlefields. Just about here it was where Snowy Woodham was killed.\n\nSome distance further we came to Clery or what remains of it. Just about here Clarkson & Wilf Boyes & Rabinovitch was killed Mont St Quentin hove into sight & passing over a couple of railings we came level to the Mont \n\nHeading south came to Halles our destination & some pie Oh.\n\nGreat fires could be seen burning all along the front the Hun burning villages.\n\nNight duty. The Gothas gothed.\n","201":" Nothing of interest our boys still going ahead. Line extended to Roisel.\n","202":" French capture & other places.\n\nOur boys still going.\n\nTonight the Gothas gothed close by. Flying very low caught by searchlights. \n","203":" 5th Divvy capture Vermand.\n\nVery wild day. Stormy & squally.\n","204":" Still squally.

Raining.\n","206":" Raining\n","207":" We got a piano from somewhere & spent quite an enjoyable night in sing song & dancing - very good fun. However the best thing of the day was to follow. At dark the Gothas commenced to come across well laden. The first two were picked up by searchlights & went back to their lines. The next was also picked up and held by lights for some time at the same time the Archies & machine guns put an excellent barrage around him. But from out of the sky we could see something signalling us a morse lamp. We quickly saw what was happening & the barrage ceased. Then into the rays of the lights came a big speck which chased and gained rapidly on the Gotha. Moments passed & when the speck happened to be some yards off it fired & the Gotha exploded in a mighty flame - coloured lights of all description went up all around it. It fell to the ground amid cheers from all the neighborhood. \n\nThe next one appeared & was dealt with similarly except that it did not catch fire & the speck this time was about it. So ended a victorious night for RAF.\n","208":" More dancing etc.\n","209":" Excellent weather again. Good news from South. American & French attacked in front of Metz - 5000 prisoners. At night we saw a bon programme - one of the best - by Sentimental Blokes (1st Divvy) The girl impersonators were perfect (Kemble)\n","210":" Football match Possibles & Probables.

It was cold & suitable for marching & we made good progress.\n\nPassing Mont St Quentin we entered Peronne (with moon shining very strongly) & moved thro the town - looking well in the moonlight - Passing thro Russu & other villages we realised we were nearing Passed thro Longavennes we came to Villiers-Fannon & at dawn arrived at our destination St Emilie.\n\nWe hadn’t been there many minutes when the barrage opened like a thunder clap & we knew things were moving.\n\nSt Emilie got very lively a little later as the enemy sent over some heavy stuff\n\nBATTLE FOR BONY\n\nYanks Aussies Tommy labor Coys & armoured cars were in great numbers.\n\nAt first things appeared to go well as the balloons moved forward news leaked thro that the Yanks thro want of experience had not got their objective - failing to mop up & our boys had caught it warm.
