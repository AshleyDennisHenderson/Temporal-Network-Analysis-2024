Wouldn’t it be \"bon\" to be there instead of here at old Bazentin. After a beautiful sunny day yesterday, rain set in again last evening. Slight snow fell again this morning.\n\nA. & B.

Parade 7 a.m. breakfast & to duties at 8 a.m. our usual breakfast time in our own unit. Erect more tents during day.\n\nA very heavy snowfall again this evening inches deep. The past winter has been declared the severest for many years past & even now in April we have had more cold with rain & snow as to make it almost a record. We should be well seasoned before it is all over. God forbid that we have to go through another winter campaign, but I hardly think either side is able to stand that much less so Fritz.\n\n14,000 prisoners taken at Arras we’re told with much ammunition & guns. \n\n1917","88":" \n\nFatigues per usual. another cold day with wet underfoot due to the snow of last night thawing.\n\nRumour of a reverse in the 4th Div. line.

All so welcome after a month’s silence.\n","89":"\n\nDuties per usual.\n\nRoam up the village street in evening. Such a desolate scene, not a house left standing either burnt down or blown up, & all trees etc. cut down or hacked about. Fritz even levelled every telegraph pole, cutting them off about 5 ft from the ground with some explosive & systematically smashing every insulator with a hammer. The local church of Beugny (this village) he left in absolute ruins, blowing it sky hight.\n\n'Tis reported that the last ground of the 4th Div. has been retaken. Great victories reported round Arras thousands of prisoners & many guns.\n\n1917","90":"\n\nSanitation duties today.\n\nThe 3rd Field are terrors for work we have breakfast immediately after parade, then to work at 8 a.m. till 12 noon. 1.00 pm to 4 & often after tea more jobs.\n\nTucker is very scarce too the difficulty of getting up sufficient supplies from Albert being the cause. Bully & biscuits our main stay when everything else fails.\n\nFritz has an immense cemetry up in the village. Hundreds being buried there. He keeps the graves very nicely & each has a large wooden cross, with name, age etc fully printed thereon. Two graves of \"Englanders\" well kept too one with 2 wreathes on it.\n","91":"\n\nA terrific barrage fire broke out at dawn something must be doing up the line. Our surmise was correct. Fritz counter attacked, coming in under white flag. ","92":" Batt. fare rather badly. He advanced over 1,000 yards. Later. His victory was short lived. All the ground has been recovered & several prisoners taken. He what is familiarly called by the troops, came a \"Gutser\".\n\nFritz had several balloons up this morning, next thing we knew he was sending over high velocity shells, several came very close, one handed up in the village I saw fragments of horse blown high in the air. visiting the spot later, saw a horrible sight. Two limbers with horses attached were fairly struck. Both poor brutes were blown to pieces fortunately the drivers escaped.\n\n1917","93":" \n\nDuties as usual. Roadmaking round Dressing Station. bricks from fallen walls \n\nFiner, today \n\nActive cannonade all along front. We miss the \"Daily Mail\" up here feel quite lost without it. Hear scraps of news from one source or another. \n\nGet more letters from Mary 18th Feb. Margot. Wall & Jessie, Nurse Murell. A Comfort Depot & Y.M.C.A. open up in the village. Both most opportune as rations very scarce & often one wishes for something to chew between times. If one can get in early he is fortunate to get chocolate, biscuits & tinned fruit.\n","94":"\n\nHeavy rain last night, also continuance of heavy bombardments. Duties as usual.\n\nA very cold raw windy day. When will the weather take up? Here we are in the middle of April & tis as cold & wet as at Xmas. Sunny France --- where is it? Its the sorriest, dreariest place in the universe just now at any rate here at the front.\n\n \n\n 1917","95":"\n\n \"Blarst\", the weather! Colder & still colder, wetter & still wetter but all the same 3rd F. haul us out to do fatigues. Erecting big marquees covered in mud, with wet ropes fine fun in the icy rain. but we could be worse off. The poor old infantry in the front line have an infinitly harder time They are the ones to whom we should taking our caps off2. \n\n Tis rumoured that Fritz is massing troops on our front. Something doing shortly if that is the case. \n\n Big howitzers going up all day. A big welcome suprise; just as we’d turned in letters & parcel from Mya & Wall came in. A bonnie cake which we soon sampled. It was so opportune as rations have been short for some time & every little helps.\n\n \n\n \n\n","96":"\n\n No rain today! \n\n This 3rd Field beats all creation. They are forever putting up tents & dragging them down again without apparent reason. We fall in for the job. At it all day today, but its not too dusty while fine. Fritz shells the village this morn – a doz. over in quick succession. Such a scatter!! The village was emptied in no time & pioneers working on the tram line scattered like sheep.- the best thing to do. A couple of horses careered down the road wounded - gaping holes in their flanks & sides. 10 men were wounded one died here at the M.D.S. \n\n B. Reynolds & self walked to next village Fremicourt after canteen. Saw French cemetery where some Fritzes were buried. Vault. smashed open by a shell. exposing 3 coffins, one with lid smashed in, of long buried Messieurs.\n\n \n\n \n\n 1917 Friday April","97":"\n\n Continuing fine. Quiet night. More tent pitching. Quite expert at the game. Frtiz shells some more this evening. 3 casualties. Tis wonderful how quickly the engineers lay down the light & heavy railways. have them right up here now, & pushing them on farther every day. More heavy guns have gone up. \n\n We can’t get water to wash here 'Tis so scarce. Fritz poisoned all the wells & only a couple \nbre\n bored by the R.E’s supply all the troops in the area. \n\n \n\n \n\n ","98":"\n\nStill fine.—the 3rd day in succession much milder too. The leaves are bursting the pod & fields are quite green. Fritz strafes again. In & around the village. Troops scatter everywhere. None came very near the M.D.S. 'Tis laughable to see everyone going for his life. It has its humourous side, though 'tis \"no bon\" all the same. \n\nRumoured we are \"toot sweetin\" out of this area in a few days & going North as at first intended before the big push started beginning of last month Aerial activity overhead this evening. 'Tis always an interesting sight watching these air combats. \n\n \n\n \n\n 1917","99":"\n\nSunday no. 2 beyond Bapaume.\n\nDuties per usual. The camp is wearing quite an imposing appearance. D.D.M.S. Col. Manifold. visited today & expressed great delight at the improvments effected. \n\nAll day long there continued great aerial activity Fritz was across frequently at midday. a Taube swooped down out of the clouds on to one of our balloons close by. missed it had a go at another missed it, shot away & encountered 3 of our planes. Anti aircraft fire nearly caught our own planes & forced them down. Fritz whipped back to the last balloon & dropped an incendiary bomb. on it. In a few minutes it went up in smoke & Fritz soared off home. A brilliant feat of his & worthy of admiration. \n\nService at Y.M.C.A. at 6.30 p m. in hay-loft novel. end open to the sky where still blew it out half the roof with it. Tiny organ & hearty singing Big guns a few hundred yards away belching out shell & smoke. Fritz lobbing return rations at top end of village. Truly a service under novel conditions \n","100":"\n\nMore aerial combats. ’Twas Fritz’s day yesterday. Ours today. We brought down 2 of his planes early. A piece of shrap. from anti-aircraft whanged on to the tent today but fortunately glanced off. Gen Birdwood expected today. All Australian troops to be relieved from this front this week, by Tommies. We expect to go today or tomorrow. Later it is. We left Bequy at 6 p.m. Just as we left. Fritz started to shell, heard subsequently that one lobbed near our tent. wounding a transport driver & horse. We arrive in Bapaume about 7 p.m. Go out immediately after finding billets in a tumbledown 2nd story building, to explore town. Not a house is left standing intact. Such destruction. Where the town Hall was is a gaping hole. ’Twas estimated 200 were buried under that debris. Visited wreckage of the once fine church. A vault under the floor caved in & exposes dozens of grinning skulls apparently buried there in years long past. \n\nBapaume is a very ancient city.\n\n1917","101":"\n\nDo not move off till midday. Put in morning exploring huge underground tunnels & vaults hewn out hundreds of years ago. Fritz evidently used them during bombardments as there are ample evidences of his occupation in the shape of empty bottles, beds etc. These tunnels go down into the bowels of the earth, inky black, damp, dark & tortuous. One easily recalls brigands & their loot, dark deeds & foul crimes committed in their corridors. \n\nLeave Bapaume for Pozieres C.C.S. at 1 p.m. We get our packs carried, \"tres bon\" arrive by main road about 4p.m. 8 miles – a bit footsore over the stony road but happy – Pozieres – who’d have thought that we would be camping on this spot a few months ago. The place is almost unrecognizable. \n\nJohno Reynolds & self walk over the old areas after tea & visit the spots where our late comrades lie. Their crosses stand out white & clear against the brown clay background. There are not many graves marked considering the hundreds that fell & lay buried there.
