The Regulars are makg. good progress down south, have reached Acki Baba.\n","32":"\n\nFrussell came aboard for the arrangg. of the Colonel’s Kit with plenty of news from the trenches, some gruesome tales he told. Bought some cigs. for the chaps & tobacco from the third mate Brown. Longing to be with the Corp. & the rest. Our ammn. was taken away by a trawler. Lizzie gets busy with her 15 in. guns, also aeroplanes.\n","33":"\n\nBought cakes etc. for the Corps parcel. Watson was going to take it but the boat did not come so the cakes are likely to get dry! Dirty weather sprang up. I slept below. Frussell the other warrior went back also a vest I bought for the Corps. Read & slept. Thoroughly sick of the whole concern & feel like doing a moonlight flit for the shore & my pals.\n","34":"\n\nKing Edward VII died 1910. \n\nDirty weather. Blowg. like hell! The officers servants are still here & I fear that the cakes I bought for Corp. will be rather stale. The Quartermaster (ships) sewed some blanket round my men . Learn that the threatened attack of the enemy were repelled by though our machines.\n","35":"\n\nStorm dies down. My cold is rotten & the odour below is putrid. Hostile aeroplane drops a bomb just astern of us. Heavy rifle & shrapnel fire. Capt. MacKay & the S.M. leave us for the firg. line. Arranged for one of the stewards to send photo to Ede & Enid of shell falling in water.\n","36":"\n\nCape Town 1913.\n\nOn first morng. watch. \"London\" fires at an aero. wch. I cdnt. see. Our waterplanes very busy all day. Frussell came aboard again with three more of our Bn. He brought a note from the Corp. Many fresh transports arrive with troops. My cold very bad, the scrappings of a mail arrived but none for me. The smell down below compels me to sleep on deck. Ordered a chicken for the Corp.\n","37":"\n\nMade up my parcels for the Corp. & his lre. but Frussell did not go back. Milne stopped the officers’ servants leaving. My cold is rotten. The skipper gives me some pills of a doubtful nature. Things pretty quiet on shore. Rumour of a big defeat in France & the \"Lusitania\" sunk.\n","38":"\n\nFrussell etc. went back to the trenches & took three bags of tucker to the Corp. Lieut. Beecher came aboard for a rest. I got into commtn. with the regiment ashore with big flag & helio. My cold is slightly improvg. Wrote two lres. for Ede & tried to get photo of shell & gave to steward.\n","39":"\n\nHad a long chat with Bn. Hq. on helio & flag. My hopes are raised on gettg. the word that we shall be leavg. soon. Watson & grooms go ashore rather suddenly. Bad weather comes up & rain. Two new ships arrive with Imperial reinforcements. Rumour around that the Mauritania is now sunk. Also of an advance in France. What can one believe. My cold is slightly better. Turkish sailg. vessel captured down at the point. Pendg. inquiries.\n","40":"\n\nRaing. in morng. but cleared up later. We left Gaba Tepe at 7 p.m. after dropg. three Sergts. over at the last minute. Spoke to Bn. Hq. in eveng. & they said that the Colonel’s body had been found & papers in tact. We reach Lemnos at 12 midnight & anchor outside boom. Hardly any boats are left at Gaba Tepe except man-o-war.\n","41":"\n\nWe move to an anchorage inside the boom & the \"Hymettus\" comes alongside. We hear that the battleship \"Goliath\" was torpedoed in the straits by a Turkish destroyer last night. The \"Queen Elizabeth\" is in Port Mudros coaling. No one seems to know what we are to do here. I believe the skipper does – and he’s mum, you bet. My cold is disappg. rapidly. The second mate gave me some books.\n","42":"\n\nGettg. pretty warm. We have orders to sail for Alexandria & left at 3.30 p.m. The Admiral transferred his flag from the Lizie to the Lord Nelson. We leave off doing watches and have a chance to get some sleep. Had a box with Tickner in eveng. & find that my wind is none too good. Read morng. Post of Apl. 6.\n","43":"\n\nPretty decent weather so far on this trip. Went down into hold with Parsons & got new message forms, etc., also stick for flag. No bridge work now & pretty easy time. Obtnd. badges, also applied for boots & Milne, our transport officer & a C.O. gives me the hint delicate as to the best way of obtng. a new pair. Read Daily Mail of Apl. 30.\n","44":"\n\nWeather still fine. Much reading. Washed shirts etc. On watch at 7.30 p.m. for entrg. port. Were told to wait outside harbour until morng. I could do with some cash though! And also some letters. Milne thinks that he will be able to get an advce. from the Pay Office but I doubt it.\n","45":"\n\nEntered Alexandria Harbour at 6.45 a.m. I was on watch with Parsons. Place full up with transports & more coming in. Moved into another anchorage at the wharf at 2.0 p.m. Many transports unloadg. horses & rumours that we are takg. back mules & these horses are going to France. Saw account of \"Lusitania\" going down, on May 7th, in an Egyptian paper. Nearly all on brd. went ashore but I did not. Got Daily Mail overseas edition from the \"Malda\" of March 20th, interstg. articles. Alexandria full of troops and the wounded.\n","46":"\n\nUnloaded ship of Transport etc. We left the boat at 3.30 p.m. & reached Mex Camp in eveng. Back to the sand again. Damn our luck! Slept on the sand & cursed & cursed & cursed.\n","47":"\n\nLeft camp early & into Alex. for equipmt. etc. wch. I am short of. Called at Mustapha Pasha & saw Simpson, just recrd. from his wound. Called on Major Mac. & also Edwards. Saw Capt. Milson & Seldon in town. Adjut. at the Base Depot instructd. me to bring rest of sigs. along tomorrow. Could get no fresh equipt. Returned to camp at 7.30 p.m. & was paid £1 by Milne. Slept in tent. Posted lre. to the Corp.\n","48":"\n\nLeft Mex at 7.30 a.m. with rest of Sigs. & travelled to Mustapha Barracks where we got orders to proceed to the wharf & embark on the \"Commodore\", wch. we did after some trouble. I’ve been on some dirty tramps but this ship is the limit. I don’t believe they have an hose on board. We live on bully & biscuits and sleep in the horse stalls, no blankets and altogether a very mixed crowd & situation. Friend Simpson is most truly a star in a dust heap! Left Alex. at 8 p.m.\n","49":"\n\nMy eldest sister’s Birthday.\n\nSecond day out and very calm. Damned hot & the flies are unbearable. The food is putrid and I am glad that we are only on her for a few days. Just discovered that we have no wireless on board. If we meet a submarine, look out for squalls!\n","50":"\n\nRather strange that I shd. mention of submarines in my notes of yesterday. About 4 p.m. today we were some 120 miles or so from Lemnos, and we sighted a submarine. The skipper at once brought her round and thought discretion the better part of valour. Two watches were on down below and the old hulk managed to get up about 12 knots. We dodged amongst the islets off the Grecian coast until night and then he brought us N. West again but I can’t quite see where we shall come out at. Durg. the scare we all wore our lifebelts.\n","51":"\n\nUp at 6 a.m. & shaved. The ship is somewhere in the Aegean Sea! After a very round about trip we reached Lemnos at noon & anchored inside the Boom. The skipper reported being chased by hostile submarine. Harbour full of men-o-war mostly French. Left Lemnos at 6 p.m. & made a very slow journey round to Imbros which we are due to reach at day break tomrw. Hear that relations are very strained between Italy & Germany. Got my kit ready.\n","52":"\n\nReached Imbros at dawn & anchored inside Boom wch. had been erected since we were here last. \"Lord Nelson\" inside & everything goes to show that hostile submarines are in the vicinity. Raining durg. morng. Playd. bridge with Simpson & Booth. Read in aftrn. Anxiously awaitg. orders for departure but they did not come today. Two Turk political prisoners brought on board. The Peninsula Press the new R.E. paper damned fine.\n","53":"\n\nItaly declares war on Austria.\n\nLeft Imbros after Brekker & arrived at Gaba Tepe later. On reaching there the \"Queen\" told us to go back as a submarine had been sighted off Cape Helles. We went back escorted by a destroyer & reached the Boom safely. In aftrn. we heard that the above submarine had sunk the \"Triumph\" and only 200 saved. In eveng. we saw the transfers & destroyers go out to bury the dead. Fortunes of war. Playd. bridge. Alongside \"Arcadian\".\n","54":"\n\nLearn that the reason for our being alongside the \"Arcadian\" is as a tender for her against submarine attack. The above sub. threatens to sink another ship today but the threat proves empty and the day passes quietly. Heavy swell on & we leave the \"Arcadian\" side & anchor alone. \"Cornwallis\" comes in & lies with nets out. Gettg. fed up with this confounded life & no work to do.\n","55":"\n\nAltho’ unable to sink a ship yesterday the sub. gets the \"Majestic\" today but no lists have been issued yet. Damn the beastly little machine. Heavy bombardment heard all day from Cape Helles. Plenty of seaplanes up. Nothing doing over our end of the world. Our two Turk political prisoners left.\n","56":"\n\nBoom broke on the southerly entrance. Over the side for a swim in morng. Boat drill in afrtn. and I tremble when I think of a real scare. Waterplanes seem rather a washout this last day or two. Anor. one went up & had to descend again. Broke into one of my iron rations & sampled the tea wch. was doubtful. Heard some revelations as to the supply of ammn. for Navy. New Cabinet formed. \n","57":"\n\nAdelaide 1913\n\nHad a false alarm today. Thought that the boat had gone over for orders & found out that it had only gone to a store ship, after soap I believe as we have none on board. Usual round of nothing today and gettg. more fed up with the bally ship day by day. Complained about the grub but nothing came of it. Parsons & I went to the O.C. & asked if as Ny. men cd. go off by a trawler but we were snubbed & squashed horribly. I expect the above O.C. was a tram driver or rouse about by the language he uses & general appearance.\n","58":"\n\nBegan watches again. Parsons & I on 2-4 p.m. but only a farce. Orders reced. in aftrn. to leave tomrw. morng. at 6 a.m. Greek rejoicings. Heard that \"Aquitania\" had been blown up in her own dock by a bomb. Posted lre. to Ede (very short).\n","59":"\n\nLeft Imbros at 6 a.m. for Gaba Tepe. Landed at last on Gallipoli Peninsula. Had a stiff pull up to the trenches. See the dear old Corp. at last. A great reunion. Lres. & parcel from Enid, Ede & Dr. Ardill & E.A.B. Ansd. Enid’s lre. Mann took one round to some of our trenches & saps. Saw Dawes & learn that E.A.B. is coming.\n","60":"\n\nStand to arms at 3.15 to 4.30 a.m. Slight artillery dual in morng. One man was injured down in the Gully as a result. Got new pair of Breeches. Went whole round of trenches. Helped Parsons with new squad in afrn. Wrote to Ede askg. for a parcel, made a job much to my surprise. We blow up a mine at Quinns Post.\n","61":"\n\nMelbourne 1912.\n\nExtra Orderly today. Took semaphore class in mrng. & aftrn. Not much artillery work lately. Think that the Turks must be gettg. short of amm. Wrote to Ede & posted same. Obtnd. rather an interestg. \"Syd. Mail\" from the Padre with photos of the \"Euripides\". Tried a Peninsula Pudding & found it good, also Gallipoli Porridge. Rumour that typhus is in the camp.\n","62":"\n\nWas paid £1. Spare man today. Issued rations in morng. Read a Punch wch. the Corp. gave me. Went for a swim in afrn. but had to leave the water hurriedly owing to shrapnel. The \"Minerva\" fires a few broadsides, protected by destroyer. Posted lre. to Dr. Ardill & p.c. to Rodd & Ray. Had a shot with Dawes in eveng. Heavy firg. tonight. Parsons decides to leave the dugout.\n","63":"\n\nSpare man today. Mail from England, also a \"N. of W.\" with the account of our landg. in & sinkg. of \"Lusitania\". Pretty quiet durg. the day but at 11 p.m. we made an attack at Quinns Post. I was on telephone from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. next morng. & found it rather difficult to hear owing to the artillery & trench mortars. Parsons goes to his new home & Ryrie & myself alter the old one. Oh! for a wash in fresh water.\n","64":"\n\nBig artillery engagmt. this morng. & a shell lobbed into a pile of cans just to the right of my dug out. On at 7 p.m., Orderly first & then phone. Nothg. doing durg. night except erectg. wire entanglements in front of M.G. The little animals in the phone bureau cause me some trouble! My \"N. of W.\" is in much request owing to the acct. of our landg.\n","65":"\n\nWrote & posted lre. to Prington. Nothg. doing. Off today. Rumours of peace in this campaign. Had a good swim & got flour & currants from Corp. Jefferies of A.S.C.\n","66":"\n\nLre. recd. from Ede of April 9th. Just scrappgs. of my mail arrng! On Divl. orders that 20 zeppelins had bombarded London also Allies were advang. rapidly. Wrote lre. to Reg but could not post owing to lack of envelopes. Bullet went right thro’ Parsons dixie. On phone in morng., Orderly in aftrn., damned & plenty of work. Mann got me 2 tins of cigarettes from ship canteen. Shrapnel very near!\n","67":"\n\nMajor Mac came back not lookg. too good. On afrn. at phone. Read \"Walls of Partition\" by Florence Barclay an impossible heroine! Went for swim in evg. with Dawes. His cook made my puddg. Gave some to the Corp. A French monitor reputed to be here.\n","68":"\n\nWent for swim in morng. & hear that Jefferies had been sent back with rheumatics. Managed to get cigs. & lemon squash from various sources. Cooked a concoction of my own of flour, sugar, water, jam which gave me indigtn. after. Feelg. rather low on the night shift. 1st Bn. hear digging right under them & we are all on Q.V.!\n","69":"\n\nFeelg. much lower than I was yesterday! with majority of companions. The Sigs. are rotten now that the Corp. has left us for the Higher Grade. Anxiously awtg. a mail. Dummy attack at night, rather a H.W. Many rumours as to the war elsewhere. Warsaw fallen – N. Sea Battle – fall of Calais??? etc. Gettg. fed up with things in general. Probably owg. to lack of washg. necessities & the surplus of dirt everywhere.\n","70":"\n\nMail leaves today. I sent lre. to Reg. The time seems to go very quickly. Anor. week gone & still alive. Mail arrives from Australia but is not delivered until tomrw. Had quite a struggle for some water & developed the patience of a Chinaman! Waited 2½ hrs. at night at the well. Water gettg. scarce.\n","71":"\n\nThey sent in quite a number of shells this morng. & killed two & wounded two of our battalion, anor. one of our Corps. killed in afrn. at Observtn. Post. Mail Day. Lres. arrvd. from Rodd, Margie & Addie Warby. The latter one very acceptable. Also Annual Report from Rodd, many Aust. papers too dated April 30 & May 1, 2 & 3. How I long for a fresh wash.\n","72":"\n\nDay & Beales came from hospital. Day comes in with me until he digs his own dug-out. On phone all day. Damn tirg. work. Two of our companies are restg. & two in trenches now. Whidburne also returned lookg. very fit. Very quiet day & no shells. French aero came over and dropped 4 bombs on the enemy. Rather topping. The Annual Report of B. Society came in rather intrestg. readg. & reminder of pleasant old times.\n","73":"\n\nOff today. Took a class of small flag in morng. Reced. papers from Ede – Daily Express of May 26 & 27. Wrote seven pages of generalism to Addie Warby. On duty at night. Day’s chocolate is very acceptable! Some O.T. from Colin Clarke was very nice at night.\n","74":"\n\nHay was taken down early this morng. with appendicitis. A few shells came over the telephone Bureau but no damage done except to trees. Had a lovely swim – a decent break on – reminiscent of Manly! Monitor has a go in mrng. & makes a row. Began lre. to Dr. Buckley but my pen ran dry.\n","75":"\n\nRaining slightly. On duty all day. Plenty of shrapnel in trenches & on beach. 2 men killed & 15 wounded at latter place. Rumours of America & Greece against Germany but not authentic. Put some overhead coverg. in my dug out. Please God kill all flies! Reading \"Rodins Corner\" by Merriman. Would that I were in Sydney & be done with this sordid war.\n","76":"\n\nRather cold durg. night. Wrote to E.A.B. & generally rested! Philosophied on the cursedness of things just now & craved for five minutes with the Kaiser! Improved my dug out. Wolff came in & we discussed Mosman & its inhabitants. On at 7 p.m. B. Coy. went to sleep & I was hauled out to wake him.\n","77":"\n\nWith the aid of some disinfectant I endeavour to rid my clothes of some troublesome objects. Very hot again. I long for the winter. A N. Zealander was hauled up as a German spy & his appearce. went against him! However, he got off but I’d advise watchg. him. Made a jam damper again & this one did not give me indigestn. Wrote to Rodd.\n","78":"\n\nOn as extra Orderly at 7 a.m. D Coy. relieved 6th L.H. Clarke came into tea wch. was steak fried by self, not so good as I’d have wished. Vistd. new Bde. Hq. rather snug. Order came thro’ that the G.O.C. was to visit the trenches tomorrow. Joy! A tin of apricot jam issued & potatoes. Shelled the beach a good bit.\n","79":"\n\nRumours of mail. Off all day on my 36 hours off. Swim in aftrn. & was shelled but no one hit. They have been shellg. the beach a good bit later. Dummy attack at night. Plenty of row! French reported to have advanced a mile down south. Eng. take to inflamable liquid.\n","80":"\n\nHad a talk with Major Mc. On at 7 a.m. Mail Day. Lres. from Roseby, Miss Vera Brown, Miss Warby, Buck & photos, 2 from Ede, most of these been to Lake Michigan. News of World from Ede. Nothg. startlg. Suggestion that Reg might join. Plenty of readg. matter now. The Corp. gave me chocolate. Very acceptable.\n","81":"\n\nMess Orderly today with Smith, tobacco issue. Posted lres. to Ede, Rodd, \nMiss Warby\n, Miss Vera Brown, Buck, P.Cs. to Margie & Enid. On at 7 p.m. Sydney mail with photos of killed officers very interestg. Tebbutt came back. Lent Dawes 4\/-. He is going to Alex. Rumours that a small rlway is to come up Shrapnel Valley.\n","82":"\n\nVeness kindly empties the Parafin into the Biscuit tin. Had some milk with morng. tea & it was a change! Had a swim amid shrapnel & shots! 2 killed & 3 wdd. while I was there. However, I soon cleared! You bet! Hear that no mail has been delivered in Eng. yet. Cheerful, I don’t think.\n","83":"\n\nOn ‘phone in morng. with Veness. Hot day as usual & plenty of messages. The Adjutant was injured in trying a hand grenade, only slightly. The string broke. Shelled the beach like Hell & got a total of 20 casualties. That gun will have to be stopped. My tummy is giving me gip lately. Memories of Powell.\n","84":"\n\nWent for a swim in aftrn. & also foraged for some milk etc., but with no luck. The water was ripping. Germans recapture Limburg. Something is seriously wrong with the Russians. These \nmoratoriums\n retreats are gettg. monotonous! Dummy alarm at night. We fired 2 rounds, the Turks fired about 20! There trench mortar killed a Bde. Sig. at A Coy. phone & injured 10 more.\n","85":"\n\nShaved & used Pears soap! Lres. from Prington & Ede, Ray, 2 papers form Alb. Answed. a good few but did not post owg. to no envelopes. Daily Expresses also from Ede jolly good. The poor old girl seems worried.\n","86":"\n\nOn at 7 a.m. Altered Signal Office. Got rotten headache. 3 Sigs. on sick list. The new Scot Batteries are a success with their 5 in. lydite. The Sun got at me & I retired early & obtained a decent sleep. Solomons go to Hospital.\n","87":"\n\nFeelg. much better. Attack down south & Turks counter attacked on us. Their shells came very near but done no damage. Got shorts from Wolff. Wrote to Prington but did not post. Lres. posted to Ede, Makeig & Angton.\n","88":"\n\nPosted lre. to Prington. Learn that they gained their objective down south & also our Third Bde. on our right. About 140 in the shade all day. Jam for me. Read Alb’s Daily Mirrors. Jolly interestg. Wind storm at night & I spent most of the time holdg. my little grey home down! Enemy counter attacked on our gain down south.\n","89":"\n\nOn at 7 a.m. as third Ordrly. Easy kind of day. Many Sigs. attend sick parade. Learn that our attacks yesterday were a success. The times go very quickly nowdays. We supply grain for G.H.Q. Tried some of Wolff’s milk. A.1, you bet. 1st Bn. went to Imbros yesterday.\n","90":"\n\nMess Ordrly. today & I found the water bag very heavy! Rumours of a mail in. Wrote to Ray but did not post. Rained like Hell this morng. & last night & I was nearly washed out. Memories of Sydney & the infancy of the Bn. Major Mac ill again – effects of his old wound. Buildg. new dining saloon for officers!\n","91":"\n\nDrew jam. Posted lre. to Ray & F.S., P.Cs. to Mr. Sale & Edna. Rained during night & eveng. Sea very rough & the bread was wet! Simpson gave me a tin of Café au Lait. What luck! Borrowed a Cassells from Mathews, also Great Luck.\n","92":"\n\nPut in for a £1. Spoke to the S.O. & was permitted to have papers in Bureau again. Rained. Attdd. sick parade for some pills. Our recent offensive down south yielded some success & we took various trenches. Went down one of our saps. Intrstg. Swimg. in eveng. – jolly rough & the stones were very unkind. Tried some Café-au-Lait – not bad.\n","93":"\n\nEngland regains the ashes from Aust. at North Union Rugby 1914.\n\nQuite a dearth of news lately. Another week gone by & hardly noticed. Got a shrapnel burst right over my dug out this morng. Lres. reced. from Prington & 2 from Ede. She tells me that she has written to the Comm. Officers about yours truly. Ans. both when on duty at night.\n","94":"\n\nMail day. One to Enid. Missed my issue of lime juice. A trawler sank a submarine after she had fired a torpedo at the monitor. We saw the steam & smoke etc., but it is not certain that she sank. Rained at night. Read wonder magazine.\n","95":"\n\nOn duty first shift. Nothg. doing much. Posted lres. to Roseby & Ede. Shell landed by our Q.M. stores, was rather a surprise & also one up in Engineers lines! Was warned to attend C.O. tomrw. at 1830. Built my dug out at night! Poor food but improving. Drew jam.\n","96":"\n\nD Coy. came out & C went in. Attended C.O. at 1830 & answd. all qusns. satisfactory. Am rather bushed but think I see light. Wrote to Alb & Miss Warby but did not post. Read London Mail wch. still remains indecent as ever! Really I have to put most awful rot in to fill up my diary these days. No doubt about it, trench life is monotonous. Third Orderly tonight.\n","97":"\n\nSolomons came back from Lemnos. The Corp. gave me tin of salmon. Joy!!! Also managed to get some paper & envelopes from Bob Smith & Solomons & lime juice also from Jormer. My luck is in. Mail on beach. 95 in the shade & a little bit over. A good swim in eveng. & called on Eric Wooster. Also learned that Jeffries wd. not come back.\n","98":"\n\nSalmon for Brekker, what joy, my luck is really in today. Smith, Major’s Batman gave me tin of cocoa milk & also news of Prington – I get my fountpen filled. Arrgd. with Bramble to get me milk, was given notepaper by Bob Smith. Heard that Frussel had lost his leg, Brown had died & Jones blind. Smith shifted in my dug out. Mail from Egypt but none for me.\n","99":"\n\nCocoa for brekker. Great news, Ordrly. with Veness. Very hot. Got some Lime Juice bucksheesh from Bob Smith. Read & slept in aftrn. & went on at 7 p.m. first shift with Veness 7-10. Turks blew up sap in our front at 9.15 p.m. & injured 7 slightly. It was a hell of a blow up! Smith gave me a clean towel. Luxury! Bought tin of milk from Bramble, drew jam.\n","100":"\n\nOutward mail – lres. to Ede, Prington, Marjie & Buck. Inward mail – lres. from Buck & Ede. The former tells me that she left Aust. on June 5 by Osterley for London. Ede also says that she is sendg. a parcel but I have faint hopes of it ever reachg. me. Swim.\n","101":"\n\nBig bombardment. We had designs on German officers trench but I don’t think it worked, few chaps wounded. Shells came very near the dug out. Lre. reced. from Edna – rather a surprise. Still whistlg. for Ede’s parcel. Swim.\n","102":"\n\nHot as Hell, touch of dysentery. Recd. \"Windsor\" mag with Recruitg. Posters in. Sorry that the Dornford Yates yarns have finished. Feelg. rotten all day & existed on dried biscuits & tea. First orderly at night. On 1-4 & read \"The Shulamite\" by Askew. Padre came back with stores.\n","103":"\n\nMy luck is in. Managed by divers ways to get 4\/- chocolate & biscuits – pineapple – eggs – sardines, still feelg. bad but the change in food will no doubt alter it. I had the PINEAPPLE for tea, what a dream. I could live on fruit forever. Went for swim. 4 killed.\n","104":"\n\nInsurance Act, 1912.\n\nOn third ordrly. 3 nice boiled eggs for brekker. Another dream! Made enquiries in to gettg. store off Imbros. Heard from Montague that Katie had gone to England. Russian shares looking up. Sardines on toast for tea!\n","105":" 19915\n\nSent F.S. P. Cards to Mater – Ede – Dr. Ardill. With the Major’s batman’s help I made Blanc manch & rice puddings. Egg & bacon for brekker. Change of food plays quite an important part in my diary of late! Reced. papers from Ede. Issue of rice instead of cheese. Rumour that the Colonel is going to the 1st Bn. Paid £1.\n","106":"\n\nFeelg. absolutely fed up with things in General. Could do with a damn good holiday. My chances for commission drop considerably. This section of ours is just the dizzy limit, of all the grumbling & etc. crowd - !!! Ugh! Colin Clarke gave me custard.\n","107":"\n\nAs usual, a damned hot day & my turn for duty. The enemy indulged in an \"Afternoon Hale\" & kicked up the dust above sigs. dug-outs. Simpson reced. his parcel from Cairo. I am thinkg. that … Four of ours went out at night & killed 18.\n","108":"\n\nBegan my new job observg. for the Corp. Mail in but only late stuff & none for me. Went for swim after stand-to, simply lovely & NO SHELLING. Mail day. Sent lres. to Ede & Edna. Beginning to feel done up towards end of the day. Colonel Bennett leaves & Major Mac is made Colonel at last. Dinner below.\n","109":"\n\nWent for swim at 5 a.m. Brekker below, in fact, all meals. I think in future. my first day on Intelligent Staff, I shall be a reporter if I come thro’ all right! Corp. gave me box of Turkish Delight. It was delight. Posted lre. to E.A.B., disinfected my khaki shirt.\n","110":"\n\nWent round for information after stand to & all were asleep. Wore my khaki shirt. Things pretty quiet during day. Our people gettg. very touchy lately & see alarms in every movement. Mail in, lres. from Prington & Ede, also parcel from the Jormers with chocs. & sweets. Hqs. got jumpers & I spent night observg. Lonesome Pine.\n","111":"\n\nPreparing for the threatened attack. Wrote to Enid. The attack did not come off altho. we stood to for some time when the moon went down & at dawn next morng. I wish the enemy would hurry up & get this attack over. I’m anxious to go to IMBROS as is rumoured.\n","112":"\n\nSwim after stand to, washed socks & handkerchiefs, had a much needed sleep.
