One room nothing but pictures of the great battles won by France, such battles as Agincourt & Waterloo are absent. Suzanne is an extremely beautiful woman not so much in looks but in manner. A common sense, she is well educated & very interesting to talk to & despises the gay life of the average Parisienne, & looks upon it as the cause of the downfall of the French nation. She & Hinds are fond of one another & I would like him to marry her should he make up his mind to do so. I shall try to keep his skin whole. The people of Paris look thin & weak due no doubt to the gay life they lead. This means no children or weak ones & the the final result obvious. The thinking Frenchman I spoke to one & he said that\n\nthe French were only holding on. Russia would give no help & looked forward to peace being an agreement & not final victory. French people are very unsettled & another revolution likely. Paris is as bad if not worse than London for girls on the street.\n","67":"\n\nMet Suzanne early went to Sacré-Coéur take a lift up the face of a cliff to the church.

The success of the most beautiful some were very fine girls. However we got out safely. Give the. Went to Music Hall in the Champs d’Elyées met two girls, had a drink. Well dressed so decided to make a night of it. I arrived back at the Hotel at 2.30 am after some fine experiences -------.

In these lines we were subjected to very heavy shelling. Lost here Lt Bennett killed & Lillie wounded. Lt Langham had been evacuated day before with rheumatism. At 11.0 am I received a message from Battn to go & reinforce the right flank of the 17th Battn which had failed to get its objective. On arriving at an old German trench well forward I could not see any line in front & was told by men in the trench that they were the farthest advanced. As I did not think this was correct I sent out a patrol & closely followed it with one platoon. On reaching Dairy wood the sniping from left & right flank became very severe especially that from the direction of Daisy wood which was in the 6th Bge sector. From here I sent back a message for the\n\nremainder of the Company. The patrol here reported that front line was some 6-700 yds ahead & held a mixture of 17, 18, 10 & 21 Byn but with nobody on the right or left. When more men arrived under Lt Blake I spread them out along the edge of the wood & engaged the enemy both in Dairy wood & in a strong point about D23 d57. We then proceeded to search Dairy wood & moved through it to the northern edge taking a Hun gun on the way through. From the edge I saw one or 2 Huns leave their trench & run back through the wood. I immediately gathered the nearest men & moved across the open ground in front of Daisy wood. Moving from shell hole to hole & shooting at every available target we reached the trench & the occupants surrendered. Our party consisted of Lt Smyth, 10 O.R. & myself. Lt R.A.W. Smith & 20 O.R. were\n\n Cpl Lynch Patrol.\n\nwounded on the way up. The prisoners totalled 15 & at least 10 others were hit while trying to get away. Our advance was covered by the fire from a L.G. under Sgt Birtles firing from the Eastern corner of Dairy wood. The gun did excellent shooting. On being reinforced by more men the party under Sgt O’Hara moved through the wood & took up a position of posts at the edge without further opposition although the sniping was very severe all the time. A line consisting of posts was then formed with the rest of the men going up Dairy wood & the right flank of the Batt in the front line.\n\nAt 12 O clock that night the posts on my right had also been relieved, but this afterwards proved to be incorrect. I put Blake in charge of the Dairy wood posts and\n\nLt Bignell with A Coy filled in the gap on the left flank.\n\n10\/10\/17\n\nAfter being relieved I moved back to H.Q. along railway line, slept there until the afternoon & then moved back to Transport lines.

Patrol order from Battn gave wrong map references & impossible to carry out, orders\n\nare not much good when you are unable to take any notice of them.\n","368":"\n\nSlept until 1.0 pm. Percy Jones paid Trenery & myself a visit. Bill Cullen inactivated the day we moved up to here. He has been very bad for some time. Supplying a digging party for A Coy tonight.\n","369":"\n\nSunny day, washed myself & shirt. Had a long spin this time without a change. Newton Mortas fired a few shots at extreme range 1425 yds. Rec Grace’s photo.\n","370":"\n\nQuiet day, dull & rather cold. Men reported to B Coy for duty, rather disappointed at leaving company. Chapman & Brand have been evacuated from B Coy, Chapman has lost an arm.\n","371":"\n\nGood mail tonight, 5 letters from home, the offensive got Mum down a bit, but all seems well, expect to hear that I am an uncle again.\n\n25\/5\/18\n\nSaw Kaippel & Hobbs of 18th. Hobbs has been back to Aust & says same as Doyle that one is not wanted. Kaippel was attached to one of the British Div during the retreat & he says that they fought splendidly. 47th Div relieved by 18th Battn at 10.30 pm & moved back to original support line. I expect to leave for T.B. on the","372":" Hope I do go, a change will not come amiss.\n","373":"\n\nSunny but not very warm. Visited Starkey, he has T. Captaining A is recognised to be getting a V.C. Hope it is but it makes one a bit jealous. Human nature I suppose.\n","374":"\n\nWarm day. Hun threw over a lot of gas from 9.30 – 11.30\n\nin the valley, caught our parties, got 70 of ours & 80 of 18th, can ill afford to lose them at the present time.\n\nKeech gassed in trench, seems alright in afternoon, inspected bridge. Heads had tea with Pioneers in Heill, have some billet.\n","375":"\n\nKeech evacuated, very bad, carried away, Fisher eyes are sores but not bad. Col Briers returned to the Battn. Forbes still in command, no parties.\n","376":"\n\nWhole Coy went for a bath, in 2 & 3’s, got them away & back safely. Saw Col Briers, looks well. Visited all Coys to say Good bye, leaving for T.B. tomorrow.\n","377":"\n\nSaid good bye to Coy, Murray said he was sorry that I should go so must have made good though the last few months it has been an effort to visit the line & do\n\nmy job properly. Left Coy at 12.30 pm & proceeded to Bg at Tsully with Doohan & Wilesmith. Got passes & went back to Transport lines near Pont Noyelles in a mood & very pretty. Doohan will not be able to come with me. Had a good wash & slept well.\n","378":"\n\nGot into decent clothes. Rode with Padre to St Gratien to get some money, said good bye to Col Murphy in wood & he complemented & thanked me for the work I had done in the stunt. Don’t know if he did any recommending. The more one gets the more one wants. Saw Irvine & Bill Graham. Robertson brought a draft to Q.M. Store but returned himself to Muclem.\n","379":"\n\nLeft by lorry for Ailly-sur-Somme at 7.45 am, went via Amiens outskirts, no train until 6.15 tonight. Had walk\n\n \n\nalong canal bank, met Pickford who was Frank Burke’s batman. Caught the train & arrived at Boulogne at 1.0 am.\n","380":"\n\nWent to officers club, had something to eat but all beds full so slept on a sofa, up at 6 am. Caught noon boat, arrived Folkestone about 1.30 am & London 5.0 pm. Booked room at officers club 138 Piccadilly, had walk in park. Hepburn of 23rd was with me & we looked that brown that people turned round to see who we were.\n","381":"\n\nSpent day in London. Saw Grace in afternoon, had run out to Kew Gardens, she looks very nice but thin, has been on night duty for w mths. A man does not know what to do, either go home single which would give more pleasure\n\nto his people or to get married. If war keep on for a few more years I think that it will be a case of marriage.\n","382":"\n\nReported to Horseferry Road, told to catch 1.0 pm train for Fovant, did some shopping & caught the 5.0 pm arrived alright at 9.0 pm. Eva Gordon, Sgt Watts, Levin & Morrison were there & carried my gear up, slept in Padre Green’s cubicle, he being away on leave. Saw George Peden & Jack Bach, who is gas officer here.\n","383":"\n\nReported to Col Norrie, greeted like a lost friend saw Bge & gave Staff Capt letter from Col Freliers. Still probably get administration school alright. Had game of Tennis in the afternoon with Ernie Read, too good & Browning of 20th. Bit out of practice but not bad.\n","384":"\n\nCapt of duty. Had to inspect camp in Divisional\n\narea, inspected camp, YMCA & canteen, finished by 12.0 noon. Rest of day to myself. Had game of Tennis.\n","385":"\n\nDull & bit rainy, not allotted to any definite work yet had look round the Bull ring, very few men working. Camp can accommodate something like 6,500. At present in camp about 700 & no more in sight, what few were here have gone to 4th Division. All reinforcements now coming over as general. I heard that 300 men from Australia came over as officers to R.A.F. under conditions that if they did not pass the tests they would be returned to Australia. 11 out of 300 passed, rest were returned, another disgrace, those that are left seem to have lost all their manly qualities.\n\n"}}
