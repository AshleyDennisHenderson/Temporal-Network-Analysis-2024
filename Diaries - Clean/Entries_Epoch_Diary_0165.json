Its nose was broken by Napoleon, the mark where the canon ball struck is easily seen. We were taken inside the third pyramid, & inspected a tomb of some king, a chamber made in & from large solid blocks of marble. How they got these blocks into position I could not see.

Arriving at the entrance to mosque we were met by caretakers & were requested to either take our boots off or put \n\non slippers, for the slippers they make a charge of ½ pt. The mosque inside is beautiful especially the roof which is domed, one big dome in centre & a couple of smaller ones. All the roof is inlaid with gold & enamel & is quite a work of art. There are hundreds of lamps suspended from the roof, the floor is covered with carpet, red with a brown design. In the mosque there is the coffin & tomb of Mohamed Ali. I tried to take a photo of the interior. \n\nAfter coming out of the mosque, I went to some ruined place & went up a tower, by a narrow winding staircase, from the top I had a grand view of the city with Pyramids of Le Cairo in the distance. I also took a few photos from this place.\n\nThe citadel at one time must have been a magnificent place & the cost must have been enormous. All the interior of the mosque was of marble & alabaster & the roof inlaid with gold. \n\nPart of the citadel is now being used as a & as a hospital for sick & wounded soldiers, when leaving I saw several red cross waggons with wounded in going up to citadel.

I saw the natives making , I went through what the Guide called the perfume bazaar, the gold & silver bazaar the brass bazaar & other places. In little silk shops I saw some lovely goods, having no money I could not buy anything, without the guide I would not have ventured into such places, for in parts I was the only white man in sight, & also I would no doubt have been lost.

It is a very old fashioned looking place. This is said to be the well where the Virgin Mary drank on the flight to Egypt from Jerusalem. \nAc\n The well before was salty, but turned into fresh water when Mary drank. This we got from the guide. He also told us that all the water round this place was brackish the well being alone\n\nfresh. It is supposed to be 2000 years old. We also saw the Virgin tree under which the Virgin rested. It is a sycamore tree, & it looks very ancient, the greater part of it is dead, it is fenced off, & the caretaker got quite alarmed when I got through to take a photo. Almost everybody that goes to see this tree wants to take away a piece as a souvenir. We then went into the chapple of the Sts Famille, which is near by. It is the prettiest chapple I have seen. There is round the wall a set of paintings which portrays the flight to Egypt. We also saw an oblisque, this is similar to Cleopatra, needle though not so large.\n\nAttended church parade this morning, an half hour service.

The purpose of this work is to hold back the water until it reaches a certain level for flowing into the large canals, which then flows northward & so irrigates miles of fertile land. The Barrage was began by Mohammed Ali in 1835 but unfinished till 1890. At barrage are beautiful & well laid out gardens, & a delightfull place for a picnic.

The rain has set in again, looks as if was going to rain all night.\n\nThe following are a few facts taken from the book \"Cairo and its Environs”\n\nCairo is a 11 ¼ miles, as the crow flies from the fork of the Nile. Situated 300 3’ N lat. & 310 21’ E long, in the plains below the right bank of the Nile & the western slope of the Mokattam hills.\n\nThe town is rectangular in form running from NE to SW & measures over 4 m by nearly 2 m in width.\n\nThe population of Cairo before 1908 may be estimated at more than 600000 550000 of which are natives, & 50000 Europeans. The native population is divided into Egyptians proper, Mussulmans or Copts, Oriental emigrants, Turks & Syrians. Also a number of Nubians\n\nThe Pyramids are royal tombs, they are all on the left bank of the Nile, & nearly all in that portion of Egypt. Lepsins has examined 67 of them but there are many more. The exact number \nhas not\n is uncertain. No pyramids appear to have built in Egypt after the invasion of the . The pyramids have not been built at sight, nor without plan. They have no doubt been erected after a practical formula resulting from long experience.\n\nIt is supposed that these monuments were not built and completed in one attempt, but resulted from successive enlargements of an initial & in a way provisional pyramid. Such a tomb begun at the commencement of a reign, had the advantage of being always prepared for any event for the monarch needed only to hand over to his successor the care of completing the coating in course of construction, & to close up the pyramid.\n\nKheops, the builder of the first pyramid, imposed the obligation of the task on his people. 100000 men were relieved \n\nby an equal number, every three months, to exploit the quarries of the Arabian hills, to transport the blocks to the site, to construct the Causeway, a work which lasted ten years, the pyramid was buildt, step by step, by means of wide lines made of \"short pieces of wood” which were equal in number to the teirs of stone on which were moved from teir to teir as each stone was taken up.\n\nThe Pyramid of Cheops is the most northernly one. Its dimensions are as follows. – \n\nVertical height 450 ft.; width of sides at the base 750 ft height of the face measured on an inclined plane 567 ft. Owing to the complete removal of the outer casing, its base has the appearance of an irregular step or ledge. The summit is a square platform about 35 ft. square, originally rather less than 10ft. The agglomeration of stone there massed together has been estimated at 2,801,000 sq. yards & now reduced to 2,613,000 sq. yards. The name of this pyramid was Akhut Khufu. The splendour of Cheops\n\nor simply Akhuit the \"Brilliant”\n\nThe Sphinx is a colossal representation of a lion with human head & the image of the God Harmachuti (Harmachus) Horns of the horizon, or \"The sun in his resting place” Kneeling with its face towards the east, it is entirely hewn out of the rock, with the exception of certain portions brought thither & which are obviously, restorations of a later period. On the head is the Klaft with the or sacred asp on the forehead. Traces of colour are still to be seen on its face. Its length from the end of the front paws to the root of the tail is 187 ft., its height from the sun line to the crown of the head is 66ft. The face measures nearly 16ft. the ears 54\" the nose 67”. It is considered to be the best of all the known monuments on the Giza plateau.\n\nAerodrome Camp\n\nHeliopolis Cairo\n","74":"\n\nHave received a couple of letters from Will, he is doing well in England, he now informs me that he is going to rejoin his battalion\n\nWas wishing that he would go back to Australia.

At dusk the track over the desert for miles back was strewn with men, hundreds lying down – hundreds staggering along & stopping every hundred yards for a rest. I myself when about two miles from camp, cut off to some pools on the chance of getting a drink there. They were only about\n\na mile away, but it took me a good hour to get there. I found water & had a drink & a bath & after resting there for about an hour came on feeling quite fresh. Arrived at my lines at dusk. The New Zealanders in camp at Ismailia behaved splendidly, two whole battalions went out carrying water bottles, & other in twos & threes kept going for a couple of hours. Water carts & ambulances & camels also went out. It turned out that several died on the march & one man went mad through drinking salt water & shot himself. \n\nBefore starting off to Ferry Post the Prince of Wales came round to have a look at us. \n\nFerry Post Mar. 30.16\n\nArrived here yesterday about mid day, it is right on the canal & about six miles from our last stopping place at Ismailia, after the march which we had the two previous days we found \nthe\n it very trying, & being again very hot a lot had to drop off.\n\nWe marched through the town if Ismailia & it\n\nappeared to be a very pretty place, much more so than Cairo.

It is not a very large town, but parts of it are very pretty. There are a couple of very pretty little parks, some lovely trees. The place is too small for the need of trams. Took a few photos.

Have had a look round this place, but am not impressed with it at all. Estaires is not altogether free from gas attacks so they have arranged an alarm, which is a ringing of all the bells, & when the danger is over, drummers beat their drums through the town. Most of the inhabitants appear to be possessed of gas helmets, but they do not appear to have much fear of the gas.\n","139":" Sailly\n\nHere we are in another town three miles nearer the firing line. This place is very near the front & could very easily be shelled, but it seems that the reason why it is not, is that on the other side of the lines, the Germans have a similar town, which they use for billeting troops, & if they shelled our place, we would shell theirs.\n\nThe Germans once had this place, & on their big retreat they destroyed the bridge over the river. There is a very fine church here with a square tower, & I am told, that to cover their retreat, the Germans mounted machine guns on this tower, & were so strong that is was necessary to burn them out.

Early in the evening, we were entertained by a big German gun or guns which I think was trying to fix up our battery.\n\nIt fired about 60 shells which must have been 9 inch at least. We could trace the course of the shells which went over our place & landed some distance a head, & would burst with an awful explosion \n\nAlthough it was some distance away, we could feel the rush of wind after each explosion.

We expect at any time to have the place shelled why it is not I do not know for it is just behind the firing line. At one time it must have had some shells into it for there are holes in the wall & roofs & the whole place is nearly tumbling down. Last night was quiete again, though about nine oclock we had some shells over, I think that they were after our battery which had been giving them some trouble during the day. I believe that if we left these Germans alone opposite us, they would be content to leave us, & they send these shells over by way of reprisal. I am told that the boches put up a sign which read, \"Australians keep your heads down untill August the 4th”, do not know what this means.

It had beautiful stained glass windows which are all broken.\n\nThis village has a very battered about appearance. This afternoon I sent off an inquiry form about Will & also one to forward on any letters that may be there.\n\nThe boches last night brought down one of our planes, \nwhe\n it got its propeller hit I believe, & had had to down & landed behind our lines\n\nof coarse, all that part was immediately shelled with what results I am not sure, but was told that the driver & observer got away safely.\n","156":" Bn Billets\n \n\nYesterday I was linesman spent a busy day out repairing & adjusting the lines which were in a very bad condition, they are working well now. Had a good look over the village, it is in a very much knocked about condition, the church being in ruins. I saw plenty of round holes in the walls of houses where a shell has struck it. Last night I got three Sydney mails from home & a paper from Nell.\n","157":" In Billet\n\nIt has started to rain of the light showery sort we have had very little since we came here.\n\nYesterday morning we went for another hot bath only this time to a place run by the Tommies in a village outside of Armentiers called Erquinghem the baths were good, not in separate tubs as in Bae St Maur, there being only two large ones, but everything was very clean. After having our bath a friend & I \n\nhad a look through the village. It has a very interesting old church, we went inside & listened to the organ. Like all churches that I have seen in France, it has plenty of color about the inside & full of statuettes.\n\nIn France coffee seems to take the place of tea, tea you cannot get, except at Millitary canteens & such but coffee is sold every where, they have these estaminets, (coffee houses) every where, you can get in these places, wine, a light sort of beer, & coffee. There is an estaminet, next to our billet, we are often in it, last night I was surprised at the way some boys, from ten to thirteen years could drink beer, it seems quite natural to them. The children in this part of France are a queer lot, they are an unpleasant lot, & continually pulling us for pennies\n\nLater 10.45 P.m.\n\nToday I received a parcel from home, in it was a pair of sox from Trix. This afternoon I rode in to Armentiers, it is the best city that I have been in, in France, the streets are not quite so narrow & poor looking. There is an impressive solemness about the streets\n\nwhich are empty of all civilian population excepting a few women & children, soldiers there are in plenty. The shops are of a better class than in Estaires, there are only a few open, one open shop then several closed ones. I went as far as the central square. I was told that not long ago a shell landed in it, it stopped the clock at exactly 11.30. Went also to the Union Jack Club, they have a good canteen there.\n\nHave received very few letters in France.\n\nSomewhere in France 15.8.6\n\nStill in billet having an easy enough time Received a letter to day from Redford.\n\nIn Billets","158":"\n\nWent for another hot bath this afternoon, went to St. Maur this time. Received to day a letter card from Louie dated June","159":" she tells me that Will is again in hospital which considering is rather a relief to know.\n\nReceived also a letter from Mr. Mallard. It is about time I got some news from home.\n","160":" .16\n\nStill in billet, leaving tonight I think for our old position in the\n\ntrenches. Had very bad headache last night. We are getting plenty of rain, & everything is very muddy. \n\nSpent yesterday repairing the lines, to day am on the phone.\n","161":" Foray House\n\nOnce again on our old farm, arrived last night. Was put on baggage guard last night, for our own gear, not a very nice job, the gear is all loaded onto trucks which are pushed along to the trenches.\n","162":" Trenches\n\nReceived two letters to day one from Lou & one from Nell. I have very little to write about, the aeroplanes are very busy this afternoon. There is one that goes up of an evening, & flies very low up & down the lines he is exceptionally plucky, the bosches turn their machine guns onto him but they do not appear to have much effect. It looks as if one was brought down this afternoon, but was too far off to be certain. Received word from the base, in answer to my enquiry, that Will had been sent home for his discharge (Rheumatism) it is quite a relief to \n\nknow this. He must be home by this. Tom & are in England received a letter from Tom the other day.\n","163":" Trenches\n\nReceived a letter this morning from Louie, dated July","164":" this is the main thing.\n\nYesterday afternoon we did & got some bombarding, things were lively for a while, do not know how many casualties the bosches had, hope they had more than us, for we only had two, we were very lucky. We knocked the german parapets about badly, lowered them that much I am told, that we could see the bosches walking about behind them, which was a great opportunity for our machine gunners & snipers.\n\nLively as was the afternoon it was nothing to the bombardment that we gave them in the night about 10-30 pm, this one was a little to our right. It was indescribable, we got up to look at it, the noise was awful, towards the end, two or three times there occurred a lull for about a second, which was weird & strange. Do not know the results of this one but I have no\n\ndoubt at all who got the worst of it.\n\nThere is a rumour, that Roumania has decided to join in on our side hope so, for that should shorten the duration of the war considerably.\n","165":"\n\nWe have just had a few days rain, & every thing was in a terrible mess, the water came through the roof in the farm, & the floors were covered with mud, however it has cleared off now.\n\n","166":"\n\nToday I got another flag, also a small parcel containing some lollies & 6 packets of Capstans & Sydney Mail.\n","167":"\n\nGot another mail this morning & a Sunday times from Lou.\n\nYesterday morning we were bombarded in a fairly lively manner for a few minutes. I saw shrapnell bursting right overhead, it did make us run, we were afraid that some of the high explosives which were coming over would hit our place, whilst under cover shrapnell will not do so much harm, but you must get under cover. We had the biggest fright since the stunt.\n\nIt is raining again to day\n","168":"\n\nWe are having a long spell in the trenches this time. Well we are giving the bosches a lively time lately, and at the same time they are giving us one, it is nothing but bombardments & bang banging, & the worst of it their shells are comming round our place so much, this is some thing new for us, & we having no dugout to go to, are in a bit of a fix, it does make us scatter. \n\nYesterday we found an old trench about a hundred yards away it is very narrow & fairly deep it gives us excellent cover, during the bombardment yesterday morning we hid in this. What makes these little affairs so trying is that we cannot get any or much sleep.\n\nThey come on at any odd time day or night, then up we jump, sleeping out of the question, if only on account of the noise, but that is not all.\n\nI have had very little sleep lately, have to put in a lot of time on the phone, there being only a few in the section capable of taking it over, then when off duty, I get these bom- \n\nbardments.\n\nReceived a lot of old letters from home the other day, delayed on account of wrong address.\n","169":"\n\nWe have had a couple of quiet days. Yesterday morning I went into Armentiers & purchased some post cards & a few other necessary articles. Was told a curious thing about rats. The place swarms with them & run over you at night, will they have them in the frontline also, & when there is a heavy bombardment the noise stupefies these rats, that much so that much so that they come out & lie about, & will not move even when kicked.\n","170":" \n\nTonight I received a letter from Lou & two yesterday from home.\n","171":" Trenches\n\nThis morning received a Bulletin from Louie. \n\nHave now been in the trenches for a month, without a rest outside.

This place is now livlier than ever, last night there was a very heavy bombardment, a little to our right, think Fritz is getting more than what he expected. I could not sleep, so got up & stood outside against the side of the house listening to the bullets, the air was thick with them.\n\nWe get plenty of good rumours about things are going on the Somme\n","173":" \n\nYesterday received letter from Lou dated","174":" & one from Mother.\n\nIt is raining again, we have had a very quite night.\n","175":"\n\nOut in the billet once again Yesterday afternoon I spent in Armentiers had a good look round the place. This town is occasionally shelled, for this reason the gratings over the cellars are blocked up with sandbags. They have a large church there which has been knocked about considerably, churches appear to get the most knocking about.\n","176":" 9. 16\n\nStill in billet & having\n\nbeautiful weather.\n\nAm having a rest this time alright, & needed it, for the last stretch in the trenches, we could only get a very broken sleep, there being so many bombardments, night duties, & then stand to every morning at 4.15.\n","177":"\n\nIn Billet\n\nHave had a lively time. Last our bn. carried out a rather successful raid. As usual in these occassions, we HQ Sigs had to see to communications for two afternoons before \nwe\n I & another sig, had to lay lines & fix up a few things\n\nwe were well finished before the start of the raid, then as our work was done we got into a good dugout, & immediately the bombardment started. The raid was well planned, & turned out to be the most successful we have made, or has been made for some time. The raiders with blackened faces lined out in no man’s land before the bombardment, then while the artillery played onto Fritzs front trenches, the boys crawled as near as possible to the opposite parrapets, then the artillery lifted to the supports & over the boys went they only stayed there about twelve minutes. The \n\nall the shops are closed only three or four open. Fritz has been shelling the place lately, & I was told killed two women, so the inhabitants have\n or what few were there have left.\n","178":" 16 Trenches\n\nArrived back in our old place in trenches, had a quiet night.\n\nReceived letter from Lou this afternoon.\n","179":"\n\nStill in trenches.\n\nYesterday I received a small parcel from Mother & a letter also.\n\nWill has arrived home safely.\n\nThe rain has kept off for these last few days, but clouds are hanging about to day. This is a very windy place, gales of wind nearly every day.\n\nThere is an arrangement now, so that we can change our socks every day. There are what are called sockmen, who bring clean socks to the trenches every day, & then take back the dirty ones to the divn. baths where they are washed. No such a bad arrangement, but it does not take on at all, for after you give in a good pair, it is not nice to get an old pair back, which is what you are sure to get\n\nIf we could get the same pair back it would be OK. Every man has to change his socks once a day.\n\nWe are having a very quiet time since we arrived back in trenches, though I can hear heavy bombardments on each side of us. There is a lot of rumours about of us making a shift away from this sector all together & also of more raids & stunts impending. \n\nI am well off for clothes just now, have had a new issue & have managed to secure two pairs of trousers slacks & \n\nReceived letter from Matt. \n\nReceived another photo from Lou the other day, she is looking fine, the real lady that she is.\n","180":" 16\n\nThere was a raid last night made by the 54th As usual we had a terrible bombardment. The din was awfull, & flashes of light like lightning everywhere & streams of bullets whizing through the air. Do not know how they got on, as good as we did I hope. I believe that we are leaving today for some unknown destiny, the Somme eventually I believe.\n\nOctober 15th Flairbaix 11Pm.\n\nWe were relieved this evening by a battalion who have just come from the Somme. To morrow we go to Bae-St-Maur, there we board motor busses & taken off some where, I think our destination is the Somme. I arrived here about 7.25 pm, having came with the transport which had our gear. On phone from 10 to midnight, breakfast 7.30 Am in the morning.\n","181":" Outersteen\n\nLeft Flairbaix about 11Am this morning, walked to Bae-St-Maur, there we boarded motor lorries We came back past Sailly through Estaires, was put out about two miles, & from there we marched to this village.

Do not know how long we shall be here.\n","182":" Outersteen\n\nWent on church parade this morning. Very cloudy but no rain.\n\nThis place was visited by the Germans. I was told that they had a battery here, & got thirty five civilians from the village & placed them round the\n\nguns as a shield. They also committed rape on four women.\n\nThere is a parade this afternoon.\n\nOuttersteene","183":" .16\n\nStill in this village, & think we shall be here for a little while yet.\n\nThe battalion is undergoing some solid training physical drill in the mornings & route marches in the afternoon. Yesterday we went for about a five mile march, the country is lovely here. \n\nLast night I got my eye hurt which meant I had to stay inside today. The weather is beautiful\n\nPont Remy","184":" – 16\n\nWe left Outtersteene about 2 pm, marched to Bailleul, & entrained. We did not enter Bailleul, entrained at outskirts. We left Bailleul about 4 pm & arrived here about 4 Am the next morning. This is real France & is much prettier than Flanders. In Flanders the country is flat, the towns are uninteresting, but here it is an entire change, hilly country & beautiful towns. Pont Reimy is pretty, ancient looking & rustic, there are several streams running through, besides the River Somme. The Somme is \n\nitself a picture. This morning I examined several very interesting spots including an old water mill, one of those rustic mills you see so many pictures of. There are not so many shops, there is a large cooperative store. This afternoon we had some practice at signalling, for this we went outside the town, my party went on to a hill, which gave us a fine view of beautiful country. From the hill it reminds me of the Blue Mountains NSW, but here we have in the distance cultivated fields, with hay stacks & the town in the distance. Our billet this time is not in a loft, on the ground floor it would be very nice if not so cramped. there is plenty of good straw on the floor.\n\nThe people are different to those of Flanders, in fact it is a different country all together. The well water is good. It has been a very interesting & enjoyable day. We must be some distance from the fighting, for we cannot see or hear anything of it, which is in is self a treat, for now there is exceptionally heavy fighting going on \"on the Somme”\n","185":" Pont Remy\n\nBallot was taken this morning for conscription.\n\nTook a walk after\n\nthrough a Chateau garden on the Somme, it is very beautiful. Parade again this afternoon\n","186":" on The Somme\n\nLeft Pont Remy about 5 Am had a walk of 8 miles, very cold, boarded motor lorries, the motors took us about 40 miles, through Flixecourt to Amiens then a rest for about an hour then another walk of ten miles, the hardest day since the Tel-el-Kebir march. I never saw so many motor lorries, there were hundreds of them lined up on the road waiting for us.\n\nThe walk at the finish was awful, never saw such mud, had to drop off near the finish, could not keep up, but came on slowly, a good many dropped out.\n\nI & another Sig. for the present are attached to A Coy. temporarilly, & just now this Coy is in reserve we are camped on a hill, freezing cold especially at night. The night we arrived here the most of us had to camp out. only a few tents, it was the coldest night I have ever experienced, though I had two blankets I could not sleep much though very tired from the forced march. In the morning the ground was covered with frost.\n","187":" \n\nThe two coys. have returned\n\nonly in for forty eight hours & it was quite long enough they had no sleep, & were covered with mud. We expected to go back a couple of days after, but the rain came & made that impossible, so here we are still wallowing about in mud, never saw anything like it. We have shifted from where we were the first night, & lucky enough to have got a place in one of the few tents. We sleep at night packed like sardines, it is a difficult matter to turn over. Last night Fritz sent over a good few shells, the most of them turned out to be duds. They landed four or five hundred yards away, but sounded much nearer. It is a queer sensation, to ly down & listen to these shells, comming over one at a time, knowing that they have come six or seven miles or more, you wonder will the next one come nearer. \n\nCasualties have been few so far. They say that we will be back in the","188":" of next month, will not be sorry. They have the artillery here all right, there is a heavy bombardment on nearly all the while. \n\nReceived letter from Lou, Tom & Wilfred. Tom has left England. \n\nWe are getting plenty of food, & it is not quite so cold but muck in galore. \n","189":" On the Somme\n\nStill here in reserve owing to bad weather.\n\nNothing but wind & slush, with a shower of rain occasionally to make it worse. This is a very barren place, a few weeks ago the scene of heavy fighting, the ground is covered with shell holes large & small. Almost without cease there is a heavy bombardment going on it is like as if there were huge iron works on the other side of hill a few miles away. At night there are hundreds of camp fires on the side of this hill, it looks well.\n\nIt is surprising the number of observation baloons here. I counted 23 the other day all our own, never see any of Fritz’s.\n\nIt is very cold just now I have on two pairs socks, flannel shirt, wool khaki shirt, cardigan jacket beside uniform & yet it is cold.\n\nYesterday I got a letter from Lou, Mother Wilfred & Ethel.\n","190":" On the Somme\n\nMore rain wind & slush & colder than ever to day. Yesterday I received two parcels, one was cigarettes the other was lollies, cigarettes \nmore\n a lovely pair socks.\n\n","191":" 16\n\nHave been here a couple of days now. Had a hellish time on the Somme. No one could imagine how dreadful it is, we were to have jumped the but the weather was dead against us. The battalion had only two turns in the trenches, I went with them the second, we fully expected that we were going over in the morning, but on the way in, which is about six or seven miles, it started raining very heavily, just poured down, the way was rough & muddy enough before, but the rain made it infinitely worse, we struggled along & at last came to the saps, there we found up to our knees in water a good bit of the way, but the trenches were worse, which was mud, it was a struggle every yard of the way.\n\nWe arrived at our position which was only a few yards behind the front line, our boots were full of water, & trousers wet through. The dugout we had, held about eight crouched up, it was very uncomfortable. When any one passed out side they would splash water down into the dugout, \nwhich\n when in a very\n\nshort time we were sitting up to our ankles in mucky water. Spent two nights in the dugout & one in another smaller one, though not so wet.\n\nThe three nights I did not have more than half an hour sleep all together.\n\nAt times in the day & night we would have curious bombardment, & then we would all sitting huddled up in our dug-out, listening to the shells exploding all round us, knowing all the while that if one hit our place it would be the end of the lot of us there, but we were fortunate, at another time I had to go out to repair a broken line with the Sgt. the shells were roaring over our heads, they were that many. The trenches now were all churned up into sticky mud, up to our knees all the way. Our casualites were not so many. At last our relief came part of the battalion went out while a heavy bombardment was on. I had to wait with a few other sigs, & did not leave until about midnight. The condition of the men was terrible all were thoroughly done up, I heard big men groaning under fatigue, others\n\nalmost dropping. The trenches was impossible to walk along. Men were bogged & had to be dug out. In going out we kept in the trench for a while, then got out, better to risk the shells than the mud. We made our way all right, when a flare went up we would all drop down. We went on for a few hours, with an occasional shell after us, at last we could not go any further so we just found a place if possible from the cold, & arrived at the camp about seven am. It was easily the worst time I ever had, for three days we were covered with mud from head to foot, boots full of water & trousers wet through. We left the camp & walked to Friecourt & put the night up in huts. The next day we came on to Ridemont, which is about ten miles. I could not walk it, so fell out, & had the good fortune to get a lift the rest of the way. Ridemont is another small place full of troops. Yesterday I got another parcel from Wilfred. This afternoon we had a hot bath at a nearby village. The bath was much needed, the first for a few weeks. We are here in a tent, there is plenty of rain.\n\nRaineville","192":"\n\nLeft Ridemont yesterday midday, marched about four miles then boarded busses which took us about fifteen miles & dropped about 1 ½ miles outside this one. Do not think much of this village, seems to be all barns, the houses are built behind the barns.\n\nAs usual we had trouble over finding a billet, last night we found the one intended for us, but also found that A. Coy had jumped the claim, however we discovered another in a hay loft, we had all climbed up the ladder when Madame of the farmer came running out very excited trying to tell us that, that was not a billet & that we could not sleep there. We took no notice, so she took the ladder away. After a while one of the sigs, climbed down & found the billeting officer, explained the situation, & found us another place, this time on the ground floor. We are about seven miles from Amiens, but we are not allowed to enter that town.\n","193":" Raineville\n\nStill in billet, the rain has kept off these last few days, & it is not quite so cold. Yesterday afternoon I had leave to visit Amiens.\n\nAmiens is a fairly large city, & has a beautiful Cathedral, When I saw it It is about 8 kilometers from Raineville, which made a rather long walk. Amiens is full of shops, crowded streets all narrow. This city is regularly bombed at night by aeroplanes, so the cathedral when I saw it was sand bagged, there is a wall of sand bags in front of the main entrance, & a good many in the interior, protecting special parts. The interior is beautiful, high roofs with columns reaching up to it, beautiful windows & statues, it was all in good taste: \n\nRest Camp Allonville\n","194":" 11. 16.\n\nHave been in this place about six day, the last little time I had in the Somme trenches, brought out a complaint of long standing, a sort of rash & hitch, which they call scabie, though I have not got it in the worst form. Allonville is about four miles from Rainville. I am having a fairly easy time, sleep in untill breakfast, do a little fatigue work when I cannot dodge it. The treatment is hot\n\nsulphur baths, put sulphate in hot water, then sulphur ointment rubbed on after. \n\nHave had two baths so far. Conveniences for the bath are very poor.\n\nIt is a very slow & dull camp, but I manage to get out occasionally to the canteen in the village. It is very cold, this morning when we turned out.

I was taken by train to Merricourt a distance of about eight miles, on reporting to the R.T.O. there we were told to make our way to Albert, to report to \"Blue Bill ” We walked for a couple of miles along a wet road\n\nin the dark, then on reaching the main road to Albert, a traffic controller got a lift for us in a motor lorry, & was taken into Albert, which is about eight miles from Merricourt. From Albert I & a few others went to the details camp which is just outside. We stayed there the night, slept in a tent & got breakfast there also, there I picked up another 55th man & we were sent on, was told that the was near Montanban. Well I had about a seven or eight mile walk that morning, ate our dinner at a YMCA tent on the way. At about 2.30 pm we met some of the battalion going to this camp, so we just followed them. This is a terrible mud hole of a place, there are duckboards to walk on, to keep one up. I saw on a road here horses & transports, the horses pulling through slushy mud, up to the axle of the waggons, it was a terrible strain on the horses.\n\nThe battalion has just came out of the trenches & I think is moving back to billet in a couple of days. \n\nDernancourtDec","200":" 16\n\nLeft Montanban about 10 Am arrived in this village about 1.45.

It is snowing again. We had a parade at 9 Am, roll call only. We will probably be leaving for Etaples tomorrow 11 Am \n","215":" \n\nRouen\n\nHave been in this camp a week this afternoon. They cannot get us away on account of the traffic on the railways & also they say that the base is crowded with new troops. There is a lot of talk of us being here for about a month. Wrote to the base asking them to hangon to my letters. There are all sorts of troops here, we are formed up into companies, we are having a fairly easy time, fall in at 11 am for route march, the rest of the day we have to ourselves.\n\nThere is a good canteen, a YMCA & down the road a little there is a cinema. Last night I went to the cinema, they were very good pictures, but it was very cold. I spend a lot of my time reading in the YMCA, they have some very nice books there, that you can borrow. It is very cold the taps have been frozen for about a fortnight now, the ink on my pen even is freezing as I write. My toes have been frostbitten these last three days, & slightly in my finger tips, at night when under the blankets they get very sore, & if I should sit near the fire in the YMCA my toes get very painful. I drew another ten francs last Saturday\n\nAustralian Base \n\nEtaples","216":"\n\nWe left our camp at Rouen shortly after the mid day meal, marched to the Station, there we were put into horse boxes 35 in each. We did not leave until about 6 pm, there was a canteen at the stn. & after a while they gave out tea & cake free, it was very good of them. We got a brazier going in the train, which made things more comfortable for it was very cold\n\nIt was a slow & dreary journey very cold all the while despite the fire. We arrived at Etaples about 4.30 pm yesterday & was marched up to our divisional lines. We will not be here long, may even have to go tomorrow, the food is very decent here, & plenty of it.

This camp is just behind Wood.\n","221":" Needle Trench.\n\nOnce again in the trenches. We are supports at\n\nNeedle Trench. HQ & Sig officers are in a large German dugout. We came in last night. Fritz sent over five shells as we were coming along, the first landed only about fifty yards behind, howitzer shell I think, it gave us a fright. It is all mud again owing to the rain & thaw. There are duckboards all the way from , it is a good walk, but when that first shell came over we forgot all about our fatigue. Yesterday I got an old parcel from Wilfred it was broken & had been repacked\n","222":" Needle Trench\n\nWe leave to morrow for the front line. The Somme is a great deal quieter now, to what it was when we first came to it. Fritz occasionally takes it into his head to send some over. Yesterday afternoon he put a good few into woods which is about a mile to our right, it was very interesting watching. The dugout we are in here is a fairly safe concern, though it faces fritzs lines, the danger of a shell coming in is slight, the part we are in is about fifteen feet under ground, then there is a place about another 15 feet lower still, which\n\nthe officers use. We get plenty of rations while in the trenches, though rather short while in reserve.\n","223":" Thistle Trench\n\nWe moved on to this trench yesterday evening. We are in another German dugout much the same as the last. It is rather quiet. It was at this position that we lost Logan our OC, who was the sig sgt. before he got his commission. Fritz is evacuating a lot of his trenches, falling back I believe.\n","224":" Pm 16. 1. 6. This evening two of our sigs Wolrige & Roberts went out to an advanced position to keep up communications. We are having a quiet time of it just now but do not think that it will be for long for there is a lot pending\n\n","225":" \n\nBack in huts again. The section was relieved early, we had an uneventful walk back. On the way we called in at the soup kitchen & had a cup of cocoa & a cigarette. This morning I had a complete change of clothes. At 3 Am we had a gas alarm (this morning) there was the usual amount of excitement, it turned out that fritz had sent\n\n over a few gas shells near the Div. HQ. We also had an alarm the last night in the trenches. I was on the phone at the time in the dugout, it turned out that there was some gas away on our left. The first sign of Spring is here. The grass is growing every where, & vegetables also are springing up. Just now there is a bombardment going on.\n\nFritz is retiring slowly. Today I received two letters from Louie with a photo, also a small parcel from the mater, also a letter from WJ Nial.\n","226":" 3. 17 Adelaide Camp\n\nShifted to this camp this afternoon. Gas alarm has just been given, I expect that Fritz has been sending over some more gas shells.\n\nToday I received three parcels One from Louie & two from England. It is cold & frosty again but not so much as last month.\n","227":" Needle Trench 2.3 A.m.\n\nWe arrived in trench yesterday afternoon about 6pm. did not have a shell within half a mile of us comming in. It is a beautiful night.\n\nWhile at Adelaide camp we had another snow storm, but the snow has nearly dissapeared now. We are in another of Fritz’s dugout over twenty feet deep. Things are fairly quite outside.\n\nNot much can be heard from inside the dugout. This place is a little to the left of the one which we were in about 10 days ago. We have a little more room, & wire bunks to sleep in.\n\nNeedle Trench","228":"\n\nWe are having a very easy time. It is very cold outside icy winds, though we are warm enough here in the dugout. There have been very few shells or gun fire this time in.\n\nNeedle Trench","229":"\n\nLovely weather, a little snow. Yesterday afternoon about 4.30 Fritz put some shells over just behind our dugout & some further back, one landed right on the duck boards, broke a double duck board to pieces. A few more have just come over. There are three of us doing shifts on the phone four on eight off I am on this morning from 6 till 10 am. We draw our rations at night, while in the trenches we have plenty. We had a few casualties yesterday, he caught a few with the shells that he sent over in the afternoon, other wise things are quiet enough. Do not know how long we shall be in this time, the general oppinion is that we have turns in support & front line untill further orders. \n\nNeedle Trench","230":"\n\nThe night passed quietly enough. Yesterday I got a lot of back letters sixteen in all, some from home, Louie Tom & England. Our rations which came along\n\nlast night were good, there was bread & milk, soup sardines, jam, two thirds of a loaf per man, cheese & a mince rissole each \n\nRose Trench","231":"\n\nTook over this evening, we were not relieved untill dark\n","232":" had a very bad time, there are duckboards all the way, but it is too dark to see them, it was like walking a chalk line.

The front-line just here is in a terrible condition with the mud. Our Lines men had a particularly bad time with the mud, the trenches were constantly shelled, Fritz sending over a great number of I did no line work, on the phone all the while. \n\nNeedle Trench","234":"\n\nYesterday afternoon I went to Bernefay for a change & hot bath.\n\nNeedle Trench","235":"\n\nWe were paid yesterday afternoon, late, in the trench here. It has quietened down a lot these last three days, & from reports, it seems that Fritz is falling back, it is supposed \n\nthat he has now evacuated Les Tranaloy & probably Bapaume. This came from aeroplane observations, but how true it will be, we shall soon know, however we have things ready to move forward if necessary. To night I have written home to Louie & Tom.\n\n1220\n\nHave just had my breakfast, warmed it up over the brazier. Have not been out of the dugout since day light, my friend says that it is a lovely day out side, down here, \nit\n night & day is all one, excepting that it is busier. Another friend is building up the fire. \n\nBeaulencourt","236":"\n\nFritz has retired, fallen back ignominiously but cleverly enough. Yesterday we moved forward, stayed a couple of hours in Fritzs original front line, then came on to this village. The ground near the two front lines has almost every yard ploughed up, thousand of shell holes. Everyone is looking for souveniers. This village which was in sight of our old quarters is very much knocked about. Though not so much as those which came into the fire at the beginning of the offensive, they were harder to take & so were more knocked about yesterday I went over to the sugar mill \n\nnear Les . Everything is in a very disorderly state, & the Germans are a filthy lot. Bapaume is all in ruins my friends went over to it. Fritz is destroying most of the houses, knocking the supports for the roofs in & so letting the roofs down to the floor. \n\nVillers au Flos Mar ","237":"\n","238":"\n\nWe have moved on to this village which is about one mile away from Beaulencourt. Villers au Flos, at one time must have been a very \nf\n pretty place, standing in a small wood. Every building is in ruins, I think the most of the houses here have been wrecked by fritz himself. There was at one time a very fine chateau in the village, but now in ruins, like the rest. We are in a dugout just outside, there are plenty of them about here, a good many have had their entrances blown in, & others have been burnt out., still there are a few still in good order, we are afraid that some of them have been mined & blown up in three places, & trees have also been felled accross the roads to hinder the traffic., they are all in very bad order. So far we are not in touch with the enemy, he seems to have fallen back some miles yet, we will move forward as the artillery \n\ncomes up I suppose,\nsome\n a light battery has taken up a position just in front this afternoon, but I suppose that the heavy will come when the roads have been repaired a bit. There has been a little gun fire, but we have had no shells our way as yet. We thought that we were going to be relieved but it appears that it has been put off for a couple of weeks.\n\nIt is very cold again, with light rain. \n\nVillers au Flos.","239":"\n\nI spent this morning exploring the Chateau de Villers au Flos & grounds. If ever there was an instance of arrogant vandalism we have one here. The chateau at one time must have been a beautiful place standing in beautiful grounds, now it is a heap of ruins, not so much from shell fire. The Germans left the place a perfect wreck. What was not affected by shells, was purposely knocked or blown down, so that, I suppose it could not be used by us. They evidently used the cellars as the HQ, but even those they have blown up, it is now full of debris. There are only three or four rooms left standing, one of them is littered with paper & old documents belonging to the compte, among them I found a few interesting stamps, (postage & postage due) & also some interesting papers \n\nunder a bricks outside I also found a few books, which I brought along to the dugout. The grounds are in a pityable state, all fruit and fancy trees have been deliberately chopped down. In the grounds also, there is a grotto, with an image of the Virgin Mary still intact, though the grotto itself has been interfered with. All the houses in the village have been knocked down, the cellars of the church, have been blown up, & the roads mined. Fritz is destroying everything as he is leaving it, other villages have been treated in precisely the same manner.\n\nIt is still very cold, can hear a few guns going off in the distance, aeroplanes have been dropping bombs not far away. \n\nVillers au Flos Friday Mar. 23rd 17\n\nBeing off duty this afternoon I went over to look at the remains of the village Baraste it is about three quarters of a mile away, about the same size as Villers au Flos & like this village all in ruins. There was a convent there, a fairly large place, but in ruins like the rest. The bosches are making sure that we are not going to have any billets. Every room has been broken though there are still a few rooms of the convent still intact. Most of the roofs rest on the fallen bricks on the ground, the walls being blown away\n\nSome of these have a hump like camels. In one of the cottages I saw some large torch arrangements it a stick one end wrapped round with celuloid & other inflamable material the whole lot being dipped in tar, he evidently used these in burning down some of the places. There are dugouts everywhere, some very fine ones most of them have been either blown in or burnt out.\n\nOn the 21st an aeroplane was forced to land near where the 2nd Div. are, the occupant tried to escape & was shot, he subsequently died from wounds, the prisioner proved to be Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia. to day an aeroplane flew over and dropped the following message \"We request to know the condition of Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia who was forced to land between Vaulx & Laganicourt at 4.56 pm on the","240":" & his present whereabouts.\n\nIt is very cold, icy winds with snow now & again\n\nVillers au Flos","241":"\n\nMidnight 12.2 Am\n\nYesterday afternoon I went over to Bapaume about five miles away. Bapaume is or was a very nice township, not large enough to be called a city, like all villages the houses & shops are all wrecked, mostly the fronts knocked\n\nout, but every place is damaged that much that it will be necessary to pull right down when the town is being rebuilt, it is a surprising scene, here & there the streets have been mined, but most of the holes have been filled in, there are hundreds working on the place clearing the street of debris & patching up the places temporilly. Out side of town there was an avenue of trees, which have now been cut down, for no purpose what ever from what I could see, only wanton destruction. While there I had a drink of cocoa at the Australian Comforts which is installed there all ready. will very soon be ready.\n\nToday has been an ideal day, the wind has dropped, & it \nhas\n is not so cold, just fresh.\n\nI am looking round the chateau in this village I found a receipt of the Compte’s for ten francs which he had paid for the key \n \n which are everywhere in northern France, it rather takes the romance out of them & tends to reduce them to money producing concerns, I think.\n\nVillers au Flos","242":" \n\nYesterday was another wretched day, rain & snow. As a sequel to the capture\n\nof the German prince who was forced to land in our lines a couple of days after that affair Fritz destroyed five (I am told) of our planes. We are getting very good food, plenty of fresh meat & bacon, a good supply of everything, we do our own cooking & are getting quite expert at it.\n","243":" Bancourt\n\nMoved on to the village yesterday afternoon, it is about two miles away from Villars, very much knocked about. We are not in a dugout this time but in a small one roomed house, it is the Sig. office & four of us sleep here, the rest are in another place not far from here. One Coy is in the front line, no trenches, patrol work. Received a parcel from Wilfred yesterday. \n\nVelu","244":"\n\nWe left Bancourt three days ago, & had a rather lively time. The battalion has the task of taking the village of Doigniies which we did in fine style. We arrived at Velu in the afternoon of the","245":" stayed a couple of hours in a small woods just outside at dusk we moved on to our headquarters which was in a sunken road in front of Beaumetz. About half way there I and a friend was sent back to get some signalling gear that was left behind, well \n\nwe had a good old time finding our way to HQ. It was a fine moon light night, we only had a verbal direction to go by, so when we came to the Bapaume Cambrai road we were some what at a loss what way to proceed, as we were now close to the front line, with Fritz not more than a mile away anyway after wandering up & down we found a party that directed \nup\n us to HQ. We had a few shells very near us which made us dive into the drain along side the road. Early in the morning the coy went over, fought their way through the village & entrenched themselves well outside, it was a very fine piece of work, especially the work of D Coy commanded by Capt. Stutchbury he charged through the village with two platoons, driving the bosches before him. Fritz had no heart at all for hand to hand fighting otherwise I think he could have held the village. The enemy evidently intended to evacuate the village before very long, but not quite so soon as what we made him do, he had some of the cross roads mined & when his own men were clear he fired the mines & the rest with HE. We expected a counter attack & the CO called for\n\na company of the 53rd , who were our supports, to help him, but it did not come off, Our casualties were heavy, mostly from rifle & machine guns, the dead were between thirty & forty, with about 110 wounded, the wounds were not of a severe kind mostly in the legs. He shelled our position in the sunken road heavily & caught a few. No HQ sigs were hit, but a couple of coy sigs were killed.\n\nWhile at Baucourt I paid another visit to Bapaume & had a look at the site where the town hall was. Fritz has blown up some dugouts & cellars in around Bapaume, including the town hall, the place was blown right up, not even a cellar left, there were a good number of deaths.\n\n Le Barque","246":"\n\nAfter being relieved by the 53 rd at Daignies, we retired to Helu, there I slept two nights in one of the stables of the chateau. The second night we had a rather weird experience, round the chateau is one of those french woods, & fritz started sending over some heavy shells, in the early hours of the morning, they made a loud roar in comming \n\n& exploded with an awful crack in the woods. The chateau at Velu, must have been a magnificent place, owned by a french Marquis, standing in lovely grounds with up to the house, it is all blown up now. We left Velu on the second day for this place which is about nine miles away. Three friends & my-self came on by ourselves we took it very . We pulled up for dinner at a wayside chapple afair, lit a fire & had a good meal, arrived at this place at dusk. Le Bargue is a very muddy place it is one of those villages just behind the bosches original front line, & consequently is very much battered about by our own shells. This afternoon I walked over to Villers au Flos, about four miles away, to get stamps, that a friend came across in a broken house, there were stamps by the hundreds, the owner, a parson or the village priest, for it was next to the church, must have been a keen philatilest, brought back a great many & shall send them home soon.\n\n Le Barque","247":" \n\nThis morning I sent home a box of stamps & also returned a bundle of Louie’s letters\n\nyesterday afternoon I received a parcel from home, also one for Tom & some papers. The day before I got a lot of back letters 18 in all.\n\nLe Barque","248":"\n\nStill in this village, it is much warmer now, though we get plenty of rain & snow, this morning the ground was covered with snow. One thing about this village, there is plenty of good wells. Water is also a trouble more or less, often we have to turn to shell holes. At the sunken road in front of Beaumetz, last week, I found a good well in Beaumetz, but before we took Daignies, it was not safe to go in the village, the road was shelled all along. At Bancourt, we had a bad experience, we were getting our water at a well, until the body of a bosche was pulled out, we had no more water from that well, we found a small trench full of good water just outside the village. We are having a very easy time just now. Yesterday the brigade had to stand too owing to a setback which the 2nd Div had, we put it down too. We are doing our own cooking now, & fare very well, we buy luxuries at the canteen.\n\nLe Barque","249":" \n\nSome excitement this morning, the bosche are\n\nattacking. The 1st Div, attacked this morning, retook the village of Lagnicourt, we were out at 7Am to move forward immediately, the","250":" &","251":" Bde have already gone forward.

It is raining again & the ground is very slippery, we would have had a hard walk.\n\nBapaume","252":"\n\nAfter all we moved out of Le Barque, left about 5pm we are now billeted in Bapaume. Just at the rear of the town are a few hills, from the top of which, I obtained a very fine view of ruined Bapaume & the surrounding country. We then went and had a look at some German prisoners, there are about 500 here just now. Fritz is sending some shells over occasionally. I think he is trying to get at the station, while on the hill he sent over some duds.\n\nBapaume","253":"\n\nNight before last I went to the picture show here, it was in an old cinema place, the roof of which is now riddled with shrapnell.

Yesterday I sent home a French dictionary, that I found in Bapaume.\n\nLast night I had another go at banker, & won about 140 Francs.\n\nYesterday while on battalion parade, we had a curious experience, it happened that a bosch aeroplane came over, & the anti aircraft open up & other guns the plane was somewhere over our heads, & the shrapnel, & pieces of shell just rained down all round us, it kept on for some minutes, the air appeared thick with it. We heard the pieces whizzing through the air & striking the ground & huts, some of them would have given a very nasty wound, but by a mere chance no one was hit, a good many were \nhit\n missed by inches only. It happened that, that morning we turned out with felt hats on, after the parade we all got out our steel ones.

One man shot himself in the foot while we were going forward.\n","264":"\n\nSecond day in the trenches.\n\nLast night was a night of experiences. There was heavy spasmodic shelling, very often uncomfortably close, & we had three gas alarms, the first was lacrimatory gas (tear gas), I could smell it for a long while before I put the helmet on, which I did not do, until my eyes began to smart.\n\nAnother time I was called out to repair a line, found the double cable broken in two places, but only about fifty yards out. Do not think \n\nthat I had any sleep last night. The front line was hard at it, consolidating, think they must have had a particularly bad time.\n\nTrenches","265":"\n\nStill here, in a sunken road. On the","266":" I & another was detailed to lay a line from to front line. It was hard work, we arrived at soon after the evening had finished & got to work at once. The line went along sunken road where mwd is, turned up sap, the sap is about 600 yds & ends in another sunken road, this we followed for a little over 200 yds, to cross roads & about 70 yds up the cross road we were very fortunate to have it so quiet, owing to men working in sap\nit has\n the lines had to be placed on top. In the morning the section hopped over & took Bullecourt the consequent bombardment cut our line to pieces, so out we went & repaired break after break, we then laid line at bottom of sap. The sunken road at is a little like a part of hell, shells mostly 5.9 bursting all round all day long, men were constantly being bombarded. Yesterday afternoon fritz sent over a lot of pineapples, some would land right in\n\nthe middle of the road, one landed on the wire, the pineapples broke the double line in two places. In the night I did not have a wink of sleep the shelling was too heavy for sleep I was very glad when relief came & I could get back to this place. The boches got some of our stretcher bearers, by opening fire on them, the scotties made the German prisoners do a lot of stretcher bearing. We are going to be relieved to night.\n\nThe reason that we are in this time is that the","267":" div. got cut up in taking the place in front so much so that they could not consolidate, a Tommy div should have relieved them, but would not do so untill the place was consolidated, so the","268":" had to go in again to do so, this work yesterday I received some letters. Our front line was part of Hindenburg’s line, the Hindenburg line is a series of very strong (naturely) points.\n","269":" Norfoil \n\nThis place is the very hottest I have ever seen. We were relieved from the trenches the night before last. This village is only about ¾ of a mile back but we had a very exciting time com-\n\nming here last night.\n\nFritz made an attack, & it was another night of hell. His bombardment started about 8 pm & lasted all night & came over in the morning, got into one of the trenches held by the 54th but was driven out again. As for us, we were under gas for about seven hours. He sent over about three thousand gas shells the village. About 8.30 four of us were having a game of cards in a back room, when a shell hit the of a brick gate pillar, killed one & wounded another who where just outside, badly wounded one of my friends Gilbert & slightly wounded Ted Nield who was playing with me. The explosion blew all the candles out, at the same instant I heard a cry of gas, & got a good whif of it myself so I sang out gas also & slipped on my helmet. I heard someone moaning outside but could not see at the time I did not know that my friends were hit, so I told them to come down to the cellars, & went there. Nield was only slightly wounded & came down shortly afterwards. Berryman, managed to walk in to the where I saw him after. The bombardment that followed was\n\nterrific high explosives shrapnell & gas, we sat the rest of the night in the cellar, mostly with the gas helmets on, we had a gas guard who gave warning calls there. Early this morning prepared about a dozen breaks in our line. About midday to day, I was sitting on a stool near the door, when a chap who was cleaning his rifle just outside, accidently shot himself in the foot, it gave me a good start. This posy that we are in now I think is the warmest in France, or anywhere for that matter, & the enemy has concentrated his artillery.\n\nShall be very glad when we are out of it, we are having the biggest shell fire we ever had. This afternoon has been comparatively quiet, but I think that the bus. is about to start, for we are sending over some big stuff, we are getting plenty of rations \n\nNOREUIL 17 .5. 7\n\nLast night & the night before has been fairly quiet, especially the night before.

Had a very exciting time leaving the house, all afternoon he put large shells all round, we had to keep to the cellars. When leaving we waited until one shell burst then hurried out, we only got about 30 yards when another one came, it was just as well that we hurried, once we left the house behind, it was quiet enough. It is quieter here now than before, since he failed in his attack the other day he withdrew some of his batteries.\n\nLast night I spent over ten hours on the phone in the for-ward road, it was quiet, quite different to the exciting time that I had the last night I spent there. This afternoon our corporal ( Ryal) got wounded, not serious though, one in the head & body, it was from a small shell that landed in our road.\n\nThe day the sky has been full of aeroplanes, a couple were brought down.\n\n","271":" Noreuil \n\nWe returned to the village last night, I came in earlier than the others, had a very quiet trip in.

The cpl. the day before was sniped, in this place, so I was expecting it this morning, but never the less I got a shock when I heard the ping of a bullet going past , I ducked, looked for a place to hide for a while, then decided to run, got a few yds only when a nother came which only made me run the faster. I was thank full when I reached the sapp. Was not in much danger, for the bullets \nwhen\n went high, but I think that this is the first time that I have been deliberately snipped . Comming back that evening with two friends we were in the sap, our heads must have shown over the top, for we had a machine gun turned on to us. We are back now in the house where we had such an exciting time the last time, in changing over then, just as the Co & intelligence officer left the building, a shell landed a few yds away from them, killed the I.O.\n\nThe last night & day in the sunken road was lively, fritz counter attacked, there was shelling all night & day, during the night I felt the ground rocking again, other wise our stay in the lines this time was quiet.
