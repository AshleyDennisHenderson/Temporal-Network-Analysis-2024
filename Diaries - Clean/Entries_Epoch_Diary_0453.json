Here I am back with the Regiment, if you look at Diary about Jany 9th 1916 You may see mention of our fight here & a GREEN TREE\n\nWe are now camped within 300 yards of it again. All leave cancelled owing to burning of Bedouin Village but in a few months I hope we will be embarking it has been a great disappointment to all 1914 officers & their people- but Ill save money out here & be able to go strait to Bronte when I do get home-\n\nI have a Doctors Certificate to say I am unfit for active service enlarged spleen but if I may not go home, cannot do nothing so here I am.\n","311":" not 1919 Monday\n\nRaining still but we have a Tent- G.O.C. Allenby addressed the Division at Richon & told them they were murderers & cowards & by killing the Bedouins had taken away the good name of ANZAC- in fact a worse atrocity than any the Turks had counselled etc etc-\n\nComforts Fund sent each man a parcel of thick Soup but Firewood is the biggest want - All sorts of rumours as to how long we are to be here as prayer goes up \"not long\"\n","312":"\n\nXmas eve & on duty Field Officer, raining hard & very cold- We are in sight of the sea which is very rough- All the old 1914 NCOs & men have gone- I enclose some snap shots of my BABE, she will be \ncrawling\n when we do get home at last.\n\nCensor these notes if you print pretty heavily- Nowell Forth gone to France Abyssinian job fell through- He is a great aristocrat these days & looks the part- like Laura I think he prefers to be thought something else besides an Australian- Laura always says young Charlie is \nnot\n an Australian\n","313":"\n\nXMAS DAY\n\nAll hands merry many drunks- ½ lbs of PLUM PUDDING, 6 eggs, vegetables & a parcel from the Comforts fund- football & different officers the recreation-!!! Nearly all the old fighting men have gone & a new lot are here who know not us- Rumours we may leave here soon for nearer the Canal but who knows.\n\nStarted an Officers Mess all together many months since we ate together now.\n\nI thought of you all today & only hope we may be together ere long- Just got a Post Card from Joe written in Vancouver I hope he got home safely-\n","314":"\n\nAustralasians arrived safely & letters from Dolly- alls well!\n\nThere is talk of the PRINCE coming out to review us- educating a man for a job I doubt if he will ever get- & our men are restless & hard to handle at present, so many are only just joined up & are an irresponsible crowd. \n\nPaid all ranks today. Altho’ I cannot dance the recent steps I would like to have gone to Xmas dance when I hear the Band playing. \n\nThe wife is one of the \nbest\n dancers I have seen & everyone in Cairo wrote to say how pretty & she was\n","315":"\n\nDining with the CO of Australian of General tonight\n\nLast night the New Zealanders came to us- about 24 Officers & a lot of Horseplay was gone in for- The men were firing Verey lights about & it was wonderful how the Horses stood the racket-\n\nBertie Austin wrote me & said he was sorry he missed me in Cairo- & said his wife often spoke of you- I enclose his letter-\n","316":"\n\nGen Chauvel inspected us today & said he hoped we would commence being demobilised soon- He avoided the BEDOUIN massacre- it was wonderful how well the men turned out considering their spree-\n\nThe Band had no Band Master & let themselves go the tune was awful-\n\nAlls well, but I am hungering to get home\n\nWith love to you all\n\nFrank\n","317":"\n\nRecd. Parcel of good things from Kathleen & have written her. I am detailed to write the History of the Regiment from inception- I wish I had my Diary to refer to but it is no use sending it. It would be too late-\n\nWe as Officers are still all confined to Camp now as punishment for the outrage against the Bedouins of Surafend the discipline is atrocious nobody cares now the war is over for instance as I write 2 horses are at our \"feed heap\" & the day stablemen take no notice. I enclose a long letter from a priest who I used to argue much with over Seinn Fein etc etc it reads like a sermon in parts trying it on the dog sort of thing.\n","318":"\n\nCommenced SQUAD!!! drill & rifle exercises again & the men naturally take no interest in such work now, but we must keep them employed- Dolly writes that Mr Bertie\n\n Austin & his wife called on her at Heliopolis- & were very nice I am so glad- As I may get an offer yet thro’ them especially if they like the wife-\n\nBig dash of \"Bolshie\" in our men here last night a \nCorporal\n wanted to Order men to burn our Mess Tent down etc etc:-\n\nIt is not safe to leave any article anywhere but it is immediately stolen & the language is appalling-\n","319":"\n\nRumour today that the New Zealand Brigade were on the point of mutiny- They have decided not to \nDrill\n any more & stacked their rifles-\n\nAll very sad after the great name of ANZAC but the General’s Remarks of \"Cowards\" & \"murderers\" after the \"Surafend\" incident with the Bedouins is the main reason-\n\nTonight I am field Officer many drunken men & Officers about- it is the latter set that upsets the men- \n\nHave a rotten rash all over my body at times I have suffered with 3 different sorts of SKIN trouble- Time I got away really-\n\n"}}
