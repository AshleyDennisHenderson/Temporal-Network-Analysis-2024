B Squadron have been taking their horses into the bush every day during this week. Regiment got paid. My pay was rather short after deducting the fine.\n","37":" \n\nVery busy today getting things ready for our departure. Didn’t knock off till 12 midnight. Could do a good nights sleep any old time now.\n","38":" \n\nVery hot day. Doug came\n\nout about dinner time & went back to catch the 5.20 train to Sydney. Things were a bit messed up when the time came to go away, but we managed to leave camp about 8 oclock. We had a few showers of rain before we left which made the road a lot better to travel on. At Enfield we watered and fed our horses & stayed till about daylight. Got to the wharf at Woolloomooloo about 9.30. The boat put off into the stream at 10 oclock. The horses gave very little trouble getting aboard. We were all pretty tired & got into our hammocks & there were not many who did not sleep well.\n","39":" \n\nStables on ship takes a longer time than in the camp. We have to water the horses from a bucket & it is also awkward getting up forage from the hold. The horses get bran\n\n& salts in the middle of the day. The","40":" Regt Queensland left at 9 oclock by the Persic. It had been raining since yesterday afternoon & a stiff southerly is blowing so things will be about middling when we get outside.\n\nThe sea was moderate but that didn’t stop more than half getting sick. For myself it didn’t affect me at all. Felt very tired & turned in early.\n","41":" \n\nBennett & myself were mess orderlies. Most of the chaps recovered from their sickness, the sea being quite smooth. They made up for lost meals at the mess. The horses seem to be taking the trip alright. Mine was a bit off colour but the vet gave him some medicine & he came on to his tucker good.\n","42":" \n\nGood fine day smooth\n\nsea. Time goes very quickly & by the time you have looked after your horse properly there isnt much for anything else. Passed the Melbourne SSCos \"Dimboola\" in the afternoon. Seemed to be cutting out a fair pace. We are only steaming from 8 to 11 knots ourselves. Our position today is between Melbourne & Adelaide.\n","43":" \n\n Was put on Quarter master’s fatigue. There wasn’t much work to do so we had a good rest. From 12 noon to 3 we had nothing to do so we managed to get in a bit of extra sleep. Our troop put in most of the day exercising the horses. It is a tiresome job walking round & round in a small space, but it takes the stiffness out of the poor devils legs. Was put on main guard at night. They mount a guard of one officer, one sergeant & 2 corporals\n\n \n\nwith 27 men. The 6th Regt combined with the \"Suevic\" crew gave a concert at night. Some of the items would have been better left unrendered, but the crowd were in a good humour & they cheered everything. The \"Suevic\" crew showed a good deal more talent than our men. They were especially good on rags & one was a tip top banjo player. We had a thunderstorm about 7 oclock & it turned cold afterwards with a strong headwind. Christmas eve otherwise passed very quickly. Didnt notice anyone drunk.\n","44":" \n\nOn main guard. Day passed quietly very slowly with a fairly strong wind and smooth sea. There is practically nothing to do on main guard on board ship. Had a good christmas dinner in fact was uncomfortably full all day.\n","45":" \n\nWe are having an exceedingly\n\ncalm passage. \"B\" Troop has been unfortunate with horses. Lost 2 yesterday. One was the old chestnut A12,931 which I had at first. The other was Ashworth’s old horse. \"A\" Squadron lost one also. Dick Farley was sent into hospital with measles. There are several cases now on board.\n","46":" \n\nThe best day we have had at sea yet. Calm sea & a fine warm day. At 9.30 we had church parade on the aft deck. Afterwards we were allotted our boat & fire station. My boat no is 7 – fire station no 17. One of an armed guard of 7 on the ammunition room. I had plum duff for dinner. Afterwards some of the boys put in some practice revolver shooting at bottles, boxes etc over the stern rail. They performed very well. Some of them got the boxing gloves out & there were some willing goes. At night Long, Isted\n\n& myself went down to the stoke hold & helped do some coal shovelling. Had a good look through the engine room & went right down the shaft tunnel. Wouldnt like to stop down the engine room too long. It was fairly warm. Passed 2 steamers today. One was a tramp & other McIlwraith McEachern’s steamer \"Katoomba\". Had a good look through a telescope at them. All section leaders today issued with field glasses. All our equipment is now complete.\n","47":" \n\nOn stable picquet today. It is a quiet easy job. B Troop exercised their horses. All the troops on board were medically examined & as a result several will have to go off at Albany. We are nearly there now. The vessel has slowed down & we will go in at daylight tomorrow morning. I have been getting some letters\n\nwritten ready for the mail. There is a bit of a swell on today.\n","48":" \n\nRevielle at 4.30am so as to get stables over & the mucking out done before we enter the harbour. There is a big anchorage & we find about 15 other ships there, some of them the best ships trading to Australia. My turn as mess orderly today. It is an easy job nothing to do between meals. Was working in the orderly room in the morning. Cold bleak day.\n","49":" \n\nHad an easy day as Orderly trooper. Several chaps including Jim Burnett were discharged & went ashore. Another cold day & cloudy. Lieut Russell who resigned last week went ashore. It is believed he was medically unfit. Finished duty\n","50":"\n\nat 9.30. Orders came through to get up steam ready to go at 5.30am tomorrow.\n\nThursday 31st \n\nOrders came to stand by at 5.30am & to keep steam up. Submarine A.E.2 is alongside the flag ship. However we didn’t get away till about 9. Found it quite smooth outside. We were all glad to get away again. It was a fine sight to see all the ships 17 in all in 3 lines. New Years Eve. Quietest I have ever put in. Some of the chaps got a bit merry, but don’t know where they got the liquor.\n\n1915\n\nFriday 1st January \n\nFine bright day smooth sea. Passed a sailing ship with all canvas spread about 11.30am.\n\nJanuary 1915\n\nWe were joined by another transport at . The whole fleet stopped at noon & 2 men, one from the \"Persic & the other from the \"Borda, who had died the day previously, were buried. Was detailed for main guard & went on at 6 oclock. Did first shift on the guns at the stern from 6 to 8pm. Concert on tonight on the 2nd hatch.\n\nSaty 2nd Jany \n\nOn guard all day. Some of the ships changed places.

Must be going to Colombo. A lot of boxing was done tonight. They are having a tournament starting from tomorrow night. Entered my name.\n","53":" \n\nWas put on stable picquet. Got a bosker headache in the morning & was feeling pretty crook after dinner. Was right again after tea. Boxing tournament started. They made\n\nmost of them pretty willing. There was a big crowd. Col Ryrie acted as referee. \"B\" Squadron pulled off a lot of wins. Weather very muggy & close.\n","54":" \n\nAnother close muggy day. Seems to take most of the energy out of you. The boxing tournament was continued at night. \"B\" pulled off several more wins. I was put in the heavyweight class instead of the 11-12 st class. However they let me fight one round against Johnston. He was a good man but I didnt get hurt\n","55":" \n\nMore hot & close weather. There was a hard shower after dinner. Sergeant Shannon was transferred to D Troop. We\n\nwere sorry to lose him as he was a good fellow. His only fault was that he was too easy going. We got Sgt Tresilian in his place. Worked fairly solid in the afternoon washing out all the horse stalls & washing afterwards. More boxing again at night.\n","56":" \n\nUsual work on stables all day. Hot muggy weather with showers. More boxing at night. Some of the finals were put through. Pickering & myself mess orderlies. Mail day. Flagship took the letters off. I wrote one letter home.

Had to put in stable piquet at 6pm.\n\nThe weather makes you very tired & it is an effort to do anything.\n","58":" \n\nClear fine day strong wind blowing. Getting pretty near the line. One of the \n\nGerman boats has dropped back out of sight & the Persic is also hull down. Had the usual sermon. Cat Chaplain Miller preached one of his usual sermons. Afterwards we fell in for boat & fire stations. No parade between 12.30 & 4pm. Got in a good sleep.\n","59":" \n\nCrossed the line this morning. Had a pretty busy day on stables & felt pretty tired at night. Slept on deck but the rain drove me down. Another horse was put overboard making a total of 8. Loss was to A Troop B Squadron.\n","60":" \n\nIn the morning the \"Ceramic\"\n\n\"Suevic\" & \"Persic\" dropped out from the main fleet. We presume we are going straight to Aden whilst the other boats are going to Colombo. Was mess orderly today. Vaccination is beginning to take effect.\n","61":" \n\nOn stable piquet today. Was kept going pretty solid all day. Our day exercising horses. Passed a couple of transports & a mail boat, first ships we have seen outside the fleet since leaving Albany. We are getting beautiful weather now.\n","62":" \n\nSplendid day. Usual work on stables. Passed Minekoi Island at midday. Saw several dhows. This is the first land we have seen since leaving Albany. Had a saddle cleaning parade in the afternoon. Got all our saddlery branded. Passed a tramp\n\nduring the afternoon.\n","63":" \n\nAnother fine day. Usual work on stables. Trooper Maxwell came into B Troop today. Our day to exercise horses. Whitewashed all the stalls.\n","64":" \n\n12of the Troop were paraded before Major Oatley for minor offences.

P & O Steamer \"Morea\" passed us in the morning & was in Aden a couple of hours before us. The armed auxiliary cruiser Empress of Russia, the C.P.R. boat was in port. We were surrounded with Indians in small boats wanting to trade. They will work points too if they get a chance. Got several things off them but nothing they sell seems to be of any quality. Got our first war news since leaving Albany 3 weeks ago. We had a yarn over the stern rail with several passengers of the \"Morea\". They met the other transports at Colombo. Some of the\n\ninfantry swam ashore at Colombo & the guard that was sent ashore also played up. Nobody was allowed ashore here & by the look of the place there doesn’t seem much to go for. We started to coal & take in water & they expect to be ready to go by Saturday. There seems to be a lot of shipping here, boats continually in & out. The fortress looks very forbidding. Saw some of the Garrison artillery. They seem to be a fine lot of men.\n","69":" \n\nStill coaling. Usual work on stables. 3 or 4 chaps including the 2 Heckleys’ left the boat having been discharged. They will be sent straight back to Sydney.\n","70":" \n\nOn stable picket with Morris & Culley. Had a fairly easy day & got all\n\nmy washing done.

Passed several steamers including 2 P & O mail boats, one was the Moldavia. Passed an Orient boat during the night. The Empress of Russia left us\n\n& went back towards Aden. Passed through Hell’s gates just before noon & the 12 apostles about 4 in the afternoon. Weather fairly cool. Good breeze blowing, sea calm.\n","73":" \n\nWas on forage fatigue in the morning. Very sultry all day. Got news of another aerial raid on the English coast also that German Cruiser was sunk & 2 battleships damaged. Heard of further British successes at the front. We are all pretty tired of the boat, have been at sea 5 weeks now but a few more days ought to see through. Was paid 10\/-.\n","74":" \n\nHot, sultry day. There doesn’t seem to be enough air to breathe here. Shouldn’t like it to be summer time. Expect to be at Suez Thursday morning. Was\n\non stable picket all day.\n","75":" \n\nGood cool day, sea very calm. Came out of the Red Sea in the evening. Got fairly cold before night. They tried the machine guns on the rocks ashore, but the distance must have been too far, couldn’t see where the bullets hit.\n","76":" \n\nArrived at Suez daylight. All the rest of the transports also arrived. Suez is a fine place & cigarettes oranges etc can be got very cheap. I was uncomfortably full all day. No one was allowed ashore. Heard of some fighting along the canal. We were allotted places in case of attack. B Squadron got the honour of the deck. Was on special fatigue all day but had next to nothing to do except gaze over the ships side.\n\nThere was a lot of shipping in the port. The \"Willochra\" landed part of the New Zealanders at Suez. \n","77":" \n\nEntered the canal about 9am. We were fourth in the line. Passed the battleship Ocean at the entrance & gave the crew ringing cheers which were answered in a like manner. Found the banks of the canal entrenched & fortified & lined with British troops mostly Indians. Passed the Orient Steamer \"Orsova\" whose passengers cheered us, also the \"Persia\". The \"Ceramic\" went aground at Bitter Lakes, but got off after a while & at Ismalia where we anchored the night we also went aground. Passed the armed converted merchantman Himalaya also the cruiser Minerva\n\n& 2 or 3 French cruisers. Our band played the Marselaise as we passed. Some of the 26th Lancashire Regt gave us the latest news. There was scrapping along the canal with the Turks, but nothing very serious.\n","78":" \n\nEarly in the morning saw 2 aeroplanes reconnoitering. Got out of the mud about 9 oclock & continued our way through the canal. It was all very interesting. Passed a British cruiser & the battleship \"Swiftsure\" in the afternoon. Could see an engagement with the field glasses on the east bank of the canal about 2 in the afternoon. Saw several aeroplanes flying out at Port Said where we got a good reception. The Kyarra which took the nurses over was in\n\nport & even the Egyptians knew our Coo-ee & were not too bad at it. We were all delighted. No one was allowed ashore worst luck, as it looks an interesting place. We are staying here all night as we are taking in coal. Was on stable picket all day.\n","79":" \n\nLeft Port Said early in the morning. Steamed very slowly as we didn’t want to get to Alexandria until Monday. Beautiful fine day. Full dress parade in the afternoon & a lecture by the doctor. All hustle getting ready for landing tomorrow.\n","80":" \n\nWas mess orderly with Teddy Isted. Arrived at Alexandria at daylight & drew\n\nstraight up to the wharf. It is a very busy place crowded with shipping with good berthing accommodation. The native population are very dirty & old things we chucked overboard onto the wharf were scrambled for and fought over. We got a lot of amusement out of them. Nearly everyone has something to sell & they are the greatest robbers under the sun. It doesn’t do to have much dealings with them, as they are so jolly dirty & there is every disease here that is known. Machine Gun Section & C Squadron landed first & got away about midday. B Squadron left the boat at 8pm & we got to Cairo early, 2am on Tuesday morning. The carriages were very dirty & plain, being 3rd class.\n","81":" \n\nFirst impressions of Cairo will be lasting. Arriving at 2am in the morning we soon got the horses out & the baggage loaded. Each of us led 2 horses & had to walk to the camp at Maadi, 10 miles from Cairo. It was very cold, being winter here. We got to the camp about 8am & were just about done. All mess arrangements were upside down, but we managed to get a bite off some of the other lads here. Had a couple of hours sleep in the afternoon. Had a good shower bath & felt much better after it. Eyes very sore with the glare of the sand & the dust blowing.\n","82":" \n\nReveille at 6am. Exercising horses most of the morning. I took on the job of cook for the troop for the day as the squadron cooks hadn’t turned up. We fared fairly well today. Very cold during the night. Went to see the pictures with Walter Kirton.\n","83":" \n\nWent on quartermaster’s fatigue in the morning. Loaded wagons of maize & bran. Had an easy time afterwards. In the afternoon fixed up our saddlery. After tea Gordon Edmondson came round & we had a bit of a yarn. Was on stable picket at night. It was bitterly cold & the horses gave a lot of trouble.\n","84":" \n\nOur transport arrived last night. Clear, fine day. Cleaned up stirrup irons & bits in the morning. In the afternoon exercised horses. Went up to town Maadi at night with McCarthy. Got back early.\n","85":" \n\nGrooming horses in the morning. Troop very small, several away on rearguard duty.

Got leave from 2 oclock till 11.15pm & went with McCarthy to Mena where the main Australian camp is situated. It is 10 miles from Cairo by train & takes about an hour to get there. We took a carriage & pair from Bab-el-Louk Ry Station to the Opera Square. Cost us 5 piastres (1\/-½). Got the tram from the Square (2½ d) to Pyramids. Found Ted Rabbitts & had a good yarn with him. Had tea at the Artillery mess & didn’t get a bad feed either. Came back after\n\ntea & had a good look around Cairo. Caught the 10.30pm train back. We rode donkeys down to the Station from the Central Square. 2 piastres each.\n","87":" \n\nCold morning. Was put on forage fatigue & had a fairly easy morning. Regiment started drill again in earnest. We drill in the streets of Maadi. In the afternoon had to shift some forage about. Was put on stable picket. Horses were fairly quiet. Drew middle shift with Dalley & Blackwell.\n","88":" \n\nGot a course of bayonet & rifle drill. Was put into us fairly strong. Posted several letters as Australian mail closed at 11am. Received a letter from home.\n","89":" \n\nOur troop went on fatigue work improving our horse line. Rest of regiment went on rifle drill.\n\nAfter dinner, B Squadron got paid. I drew £4\/16\/- & not before it was wanted. Went to the picture show after tea. Several of the chaps went to town & came home pretty full.\n","90":" \n\nWent on Regtl Q-master’s fatigue before breakfast, drawing the Regtl bread & meat. Dress parade for inspection in the morning.

Left by the 10.15am train & got to Maad Boussi Rly Stn at 11am. Had an easy day, & spent most of my spare time looking round Cairo. Had about 8 or 9 hours off altogether to look around. They make you pay for everything very high & the piastres go quickly. Had a yarn\n\nwith a Frenchman employed at Chandres Freres & he says he will show me around Cairo some Sunday. The streets of Cairo are crowded at night & there is no doubt the Austn is very popular \nno doubt\n probably because he spends freely. Spent a fairly cold night on guard.\n","92":" \n\nCame off guard at 11 oclock & knocked about the town till 3 oclock. There was a great crowd of soldiers in town in the afternoon. Races were on.

The 7th Lancaster Territorial Regt are quartered here. They are very small chaps but good drillers and marchers. The tucker here is better than in camp & this job would do me all the time we are here. The niggers do all the work clean camp, dishes, boots, bandoliers, etc. Went on duty at 8pm with 12 others regulating the traffic & seeing that soldiers did not overcrowd trains, etc. 3 of us went down to Manchiet-el-Sadr where we set on a seat & had nothing to do.

It didn’t make any difference. The niggers kept up a perpetual din until about 1 or 2am, but we got used to that. They ran quite a number of native women in to goal & most of them seemed to know the way. From what I could see I should prefer to sleep in the Police Station, than in any other part of that quarter. We discovered 3 Tommies in a room upstairs in a dark & dingy hovel. They had been in bed but we found them hiding underneath in their shirts.

We watched more bombardment of Turkish batteries by the \"London\".\n","188":" \n\nWe landed in the afternoon\n\nTwo steamers took us off the \"Lutzow\" & took us close to shore, where pinnaces with barges attached took us off to the landing place. The Turks found us pretty quickly and shrapnel was bursting right on the spot when the fourth load got away. We all ducked as each shell burst, but they also took it well. I saw Douglas Moreton whom I knew at Yanco as soon as I landed & had a yarn with him. We prepared dug outs at the top end of Shrapnel Valley that night. Corpl Cheater of our troop got struck in the foot, but it was not serious. We had an alarm that night but I didn’t hear it & so slept on.\n","189":" \n\nWe had a fair drop of rain in the morning. Had a good loaf during the day & a good sleep at night. There was heavy rifle fire during the night, but it was only the Turks\n\ntrying to frighten us. But the Austlans are a tough lot. They have taken to this game as though they were born to it. I don’t think they like living in trenches. They are always growling, but they are there when there is anything doing.\n","190":" \n\nIt rained the best part of the morning. It wasn’t too comfortable especially as we had to cook our own tucker. We get a good issue of rations, including biscuits, bacon, tea & sugar, beef, cheese & jam, cigarettes, tobacco & matches. After dinner we marched out. By good luck our Squadron was attached to the Battalion Alf Outridge is in & we were in the trenches with them at 6 oclock. The Turks started their usual burst of firing, but made no attack. They fire to keep us from attacking. We came out again at 6 oclock into the rest trenches.\n\nI looked around for Alf & found him safe & sound & looking as usual.\n","191":" \n\nMost of the troop were on fatigue work. We got a fair bit of sleep during the night but have to turn out at 3am & stand to arms. It is one continual turn out here & you are lucky if you can manage to get more than 2 hours without any interruption.\n","192":" \n\nWe went on duty again at 6am. At 8am the Turks put up a white flag & were granted 8 hours to bury their dead. It was very acceptable. We sent out our parties but they were soon finished. The Turks were all day as the ground was littered with their dead & piled high in places. The smell was considerably reduced, much to our relief. About 5 oclock firing stated again & it was very heavy nearly all night. A party was trying to get\n\nbombs into our trenches. Some snipers got fairly close. We put in a heavy fire & it quietened them down. Poor old Segt Parkes was killed, a better chap never walked. We were all very much affected about it.\n","193":" \n\nWe were on fatigue nearly all the morning. I was very tired after the previous nights duty & just got settled down into a comfortable sleep when we had to shift again to relieve B Company. At 6 oclock we moved into the supports. The \"Triumph\" was torpedoed in full view of our position today. She took 35 minutes to sink but most of the crew were drowned. She had done some fine work here. We had a crowded night in the supports & were not too comfortable. There was a fair bit of rain during the day.\n","194":" \n\nWe went into the trenches\n\nagain at 12.30 & again at 6.30pm. We caught a fairly good shelling at tea time, but there were no casualties. The parapets of the trench were broken down. Again in the morning we got another dose of shrapnel & poor Freddy Isted got a splinter across his eye & head. He was pretty bad but the doctor thinks he will survive. We heard later he had lost an eye but was progressing favourably.\n","195":" \n\nWent on fatigue in the afternoon & deepened our trenches a bit. We had all night in the rest trenches & didn’t have to turn out although there was heavy firing just after dark. We don’t take much notice of it as the Turks do that every night.\n\nFriday 28th \n\nWent into the firing line at 6.30am. The sun was fairly hot during the day & I wasn’t sorry to get out into the\n","196":"\n\nshade at 12.30pm & get some sleep. All day the Turks were very quiet & part of the night but early in the morning the Turks blew up a trench (disused) on the left & there was heavy scrapping till about 9am. Our chaps took portion of a trench which will strengthen us considerably. Jack Culley had 2 fingers shot off during the night.\n","197":" \n\nCame out at 6.30am & got our mail. I got letters from Uncle Gordon, 2 from mother & one from Kate, also some papers. Had a good sleep during the day. There was further scrapping on the left & our artillery did a lot of execution among the Turks who were massing for an attack.\n","198":" \n\nWent back into the trenches at 12.30pm & again at 6.30pm.\n\nMay-June 1915\n\nThere was hardly a shot fired on either side.\n","199":" \n\nCame out for 24 hrs in the rest trenches at 6.30am. Did a bit of digging on the morning & a good sleep in the afternoon. Alf Outridge came round for a yarn. I heard that John Kirby was missing & that Arthur Wright was wounded.\n","200":" \n\nWe had a quiet morning in the trenches. Things are getting too quiet altogether & it is hard to realize you are taking part in a war at all. The Turks shelled the trenches just before we went in but did no damage except for a few sand bags. The sun gets quite warm in the middle of the day & the flies are getting fairly plentiful.\n","201":" \n\nCame out at 5am &\n","202":"\n\nafter breakfast went on firewood fatigue. Had a good sleep in the afternoon. We were first supports at night, but there was nothing doing.\n\nThursday 3rd \n\nWe were relieved out of the trenches at 12.30pm & came out & occupied dug-outs in shrapnel Gully. We will have 3 days rest before we go in again. At night we go into the supports. There was heavy fire from the Turkish trenches at night. The cruiser \"Minerva\" came round in the afternoon & fired about 60 shots destroying an ammunition train, I believe.\n","203":" \n\nCame back to our dug-outs at 5am. I was on fatigue during the morning & in the afternoon went down to the beach for a swim. The water was pretty cold. There was a big bombardment down near Cape Hellas\n","204":"\n\n& for hours there was a continuous rumble of heavy guns firing. It was said to be the big hill stronghold of the Turks the ships were bombarding. At night about 11pm the Turks on our left fired very heavily. Our artillery & bomb-guns opened up & there was a terrible roar & rattle for over an hour during which time we stood to arms, but I don’t think the Turks made any attacks.\n\nSaturday 5th \n\nPut in an easy morning. It is alright doing your own cooking for a few days. You can get so much more tea & your bacon & meat hot, whereas in the trenches it is generally pretty cold before it reaches you. The Turks gave our position a lot of shrapnel all day, but didn’t do much damage. Segt Tresilian got hit, but not badly. We went into the supports at 6pm, but had a quiet night & a good sleep.\n","205":" \n\nHad a good sleep morning. At 11.30am got ready to go back into the trenches again. A & C troop are working together & B & D. A & C Troops went in first & we went into the supports for the night.\n","206":" \n\nAt 6.30 B Troop relieved A & we had a quiet morning. We had a spell from12.30 to 6.30. There was nothing much doing at night, hardly a shot being fired on our right.\n","207":" \n\nWe came out at 5am & had a good spell during the day. The flies are very troublesome however & the constant moving about from rest to supports, supports to firing line etc is a proper nark. We got our cigarettes & tobacco today. It is very hard to get anything in the way of reading matter, even a sale catalogue would be eagerly seized now. We have had no mail for\n","208":"\n\na fortnight.\n\nWednesday 9th \n\nWent into support at 6.30am. We had an uncomfortable time as there was a fair wind blowing & the dust from the parapets was continually showering on us. \nAfter dinner we went into No 2 sap to relieve B Company.\n We went into the trenches at 6.30pm & had a quiet night.\n","209":" \n\nCame out at 6.30am. Went round to B Cos supports & had a yarn with Alf whose Co we are relieving at 12.30pm. A & C Troops finished the day & night in the trenches & things were very quiet again. I had a fairly crook night with diarrhoea & vomiting.\n","210":" \n\nWent & saw the doctor & got a no 9 pill which is pretty severe. Got 24 hrs light duty, so didn’t have to go into the trenches. Had a good sleep in the afternoon but at night didn’t feel quite well. The Turks in front of us were very quiet.\n\nMail day. Got letters from Frank & mother.\n","211":" \n\nMy birthday. Was feeling right again this morning. Went down to the beach & had a swim. The water was pretty cold. Chauncey got sick & it is feared he has typhoid. He went away probably to Lemnos. The Turks put in a good deal of shrapnel in the morning but knocked off about 10am, our batteries must have been making it to warm for them. Had yarn with Capt Robertson this morning & scored a few envelopes off him.\n","212":" \n\nFine warm day, very quiet. Howlett got sick & went for a few days spell. Relieved C Company. Went into the trenches at noon & came out 6am. Received letter from Carrie.\n","213":" \n\nHad a good spell during the day. The Turks put in some big shells today, but they didn’t do much damage. Was on fatigue at night digging.\n","214":" \n\nWent into the trenches at 6am.\n\nGot a shelling between 8 &10 with shrapnel & 11 inch. Allen was wounded in the head. There were no other casualties in our troop. Went down to the beach in the afternoon. There was a big swell. The day was about the hottest we have yet got here.\n","215":" \n\nAt noon our Squadron relieved A Company. There was some rain in the morning. The Turks started shelling about 1 oclock & there was a vigorous artillery duel for a couple of hours. Went down to the beach for bags. We got into an exposed position for a couple of hundred yards & got roared on. Was on fatigue at night for a couple of hours in the firing line.\n","216":" \n\nWeather fine & clear again. Went into the firing line at noon & had a quiet time. At night there were a good few bombs thrown but I think the Turks got the worst of it with the bombs.\n\nFriday 18th \n\nWe were relieved by C Troop at 6am. Our artillery shelled the Turks trenches\n","217":"\n\nat daylight. Tpr Bellenger was shot in the chest. He will probably get right again. The rest of the day was quiet.\n","218":" \n\nWent into the firing line at 6 oclock & were relieved by the infantry at noon. We all came out of the trenches & occupied dug-outs in the gully. We are going to be brigaded together again & occupy a certain portion of the firing line. We had a big lot of fatigues to do during the day & at night a big party went out trench digging. They did very well & were complimented by Genl Walker on their work.\n\nSunday 20th \n\nWas on fatigue in the morning till 10.30am. Was detailed for guard duty at Brigade HQrs. I wasn’t feeling too good but got much better after tea. The day was very warm.\n\nMonday 21st \n\nHad an easy day on guard. The Austln mail came in today. I saw the\n","219":"\n\nDorrigo Gazettes of","220":" & 1st May. Had a long yarn with the boys & a couple of feeds with them. Went down for a swim after tea & it was a treat in. Got letters from Roy & Kate & one from Jno Scarvell.\n","221":" \n\nVery warm day. At 10.30am 40 of our Squadron went out trench digging. We put in 4 hrs work & it was pretty hot. We lost a lot of perspiration. The Turks were pretty busy with their guns again & it is said that the \"Humber\" silenced one.\n","222":" \n\nMore trench digging. In the afternoon all B Squadron shifted over to where the 5th are. I had a great swim. The water is only about 50 yds from our dug-outs.\n\nThursday 24th \n\nWe put in a good solid day with the pick & shovel & fixed up a good camping place for ourselves. The day was\n","223":"\n\nfairly hot & the water too tempting. It is a pity that the water is so exposed to snipers. Was on Q’Masters fatigue at 8pm.\n","224":" \n\nPut in some pretty hard pick & shovel work at the new communication trenches.\n","225":" \n\nHad a fairly easy day only 4 hrs on the pick & shovel.\n","226":" \n\nWas on water fatigue. It is a fairly strenuous job this hot weather as we have a full mile to go for it & a good portion of the track is through sand. Got letters from mother & cousin Meg, also from Frank & Doug.\n\nMonday 28th \n\nVery hot day. We had to stand to arms at 12 o’clock. About 12.30 portion of our Brigade attacked the Turks on the right & occupied the Balkan Gun Pits. It was fairly lively. The 5th had a good few casualties mostly wounded slightly. However\n","227":"\n\nThe object of the advance was achieved & our machine guns got in some effective work. We had to stand in support all the afternoon & night. I was detailed off for QM’s fatigue & got a few hours sleep when I finished.\n","228":" \n\nAnother very hot day. The bombardment south continued all day but was not nearly so severe as yesterday. Our troops are still in the trenches. Was on QM’s fatigue all day. There was an exchange at night a strong wind blowing & a fair sea was running. The Turks, mainly Ottoman Guards charged on Popes Hill. They lost 270 killed. The","229":" Light Horse doing most of the damage.\n","230":" \n\nOur troop came out of their trenches at noon. I was on QM’s fatigue. At night 3 of us went out on patrol on the right but it came up a heavy storm with rain & we had to come in after being out about an hour. We got very wet.\n","231":"\n\nThursday July 1st \n\nB Squadron sent out a trench digging party at 7.45. Cpl Cheater & 4 of us formed a covering party in front. The Turks put several shells in amongst us but they did no damage. Waygood went away sick.\n","232":" \n\nCool windy day. Was sapping in a tunnel in the afternoon & put in a good solid 4 hours at it. Had a swim at night.\n","233":" \n\nHad a spell in the morning & four hours trench digging in the afternoon. It was fairly warm. The Turks gave us a bit of a shelling & we had 2 men wounded.\n","234":" \n\nWas on water fatigue all day. It was a fairly easy job. Had only to go the long distance to Shrapnel Gully once. Posted letters to Mrs Blomfield & Dorothy Blair.\n","235":" \n\nThe Turks gave us a good reveille at 4am with about 50 shells. Our guns opened up & they knocked off. One of our men was wounded. Was on pick & shovel work all day. There was great activity in the bay. Seem to be searching for the submarine which sank a French troopship yesterday. The enemy started a big 11 inch going quite close to our lines but quite a number of their shells overreached & fell into the sea. Got a letter from mother in the mail tonight dated June 1st.\n","236":" \n\nWas on a gun dragging fatigue in the morning. Had nothing else to do all day, wrote a letter to mother.\n","237":" \n\nWas mess orderly & had an easy day. Went down on to the beach at night drawing rations & didn’t have to stand to in the morning.\n","238":" \n\nThere was a fair bit of shelling on both sides. The Turks were very keen on hitting a trawler which came in right close to draw their fire. They wasted about 20 shells on her. We went out digging at night & put down the first 2 ft of 150 yds of trench.\n","239":" \n\nHad a spell during the day. The monitor shelled a big hill between our position & Achi Baba. At night we went out again & improved the trenches.\n","240":" \n\nThe artillery was very lively today & shrapnel was falling everywhere. A few of the 7th got hit, a couple of them fatally. The \"Lord Nelson\" did some heavy bombarding on the same hill as the monitor shelled & the shell explosions were tremendous. I believe they were on to some big gun positions. Later a cruiser of the town class put in some broadsides just where we couldn’t\n","241":"\n\nsee but an aeroplane was up all the time & the Turks must have fired over 50 shrapnel shells at her. We did some more trench digging at night. Am beginning to get fed up with all this night work, as it is nearly impossible to sleep in the day time for heat & flies. Was not feeling too good at night time. A change in tucker would be very acceptable. The menu is not sufficient to stand much pick & shovel work on.\n\nSunday 11th \n\nWent to the doctor & got a pill. Still on duty though. Chauney got wounded slightly by a sniper on the beach. They have been pretty hot these last 2 days. Was on the pick & shovel at night digging a support trench. Came in at 2am.\n","242":" \n\nThere was another demonstration in front of our lines this morning. The Turks put in a hot shrapnel fire. We had 4 men killed & 9 wounded out of about 27\n","243":"\n\nwho went out. There was a big bombardment of Achi Baba in the afternoon. It was a great sight, but I wouldn’t have given much on being there. More trench digging at night.\n\nTuesday 13th \n\nWe did nothing during the day but it was too hot to sleep. Our regiment got 60 reinforcements. \"A\" Squadron was digging at night & \"B\" Squadron formed a covering party. We had 4 hrs out in front & the Turks put in a very heavy fire. We could hear them talking & their covering party moving in the bushes. We came back to camp at 4am & I felt pretty tired.\n","244":" \n\nWas on water fatigue in the morning. Had a fairly busy day & no time for sleep. Had to go out on covering party again at night. Was relieved at 12.30am but got no sleep\n","245":"\n\ntill four\n\nThursday 15th \n\nCame back to our dug-outs at 6 & slept or tried to till 12. The afternoon was very hot. B & C Squadrons came out & took over the trenches in front. We had a fairly quiet night & I managed to get in 4 hrs sleep in the bottom of the trench.\n","246":" \n\nB & C Squadrons got to work on their dug outs behind their support trenches. John Turk could see us from their look out at Gaba Tepe & he put in 4 high explosive shells. We worked in the smaller portion after that. I did a solid day with the pick & shovel. Was on covering party at night. The Turks did a bit of firing & tried to bomb us but they didn’t get close enough. Got relieved at 1am.\n","247":" \n\nWe went into the trenches at 6pm & came out at 6am. Was on fatigue in the afternoon getting bags up from the beach for the new firing line.\n","248":" \n\nWent back into the trenches at 4pm.\n\nThere was a fair bit of firing done & at midnight we were relieved by A Troop. We filed out after breakfast. I was detailed off for special sapping in the afternoon with 5 others on 3rd shift.\n","249":" \n\nStarted at 4 am digging firing pits in the new firing line & sandbagging & making new loopholes. Came off at 8 am. Had a fairly easy day & went on again at 4 pm. Forgot to mention that I received letters from mother Doug, Carrie & Roy Blair & sent replies to all but Doug.\n\nTuesday 20th\n\nA sniper in the bushes in front of our trench exchanged shots with Major Windyer but they both missed. A party of 10 belonging to the 7th undertook to go after him. Os Walker (of Dorrigo) was one of them. They nearly ran into the Turks trench which was full & they were fired on heavily.\n\nThey got in however no one being hit. The Turks must have got a great surprise seeing 10 men charging them. They fired like blazes for an hour later wasting a terrible lot of ammunition. I went after bags in the afternoon & had a swim. There was very heavy firing again at night & the cracking of rifles & bullets nearly deafened us. I saw a high explosive shell crash into the cook house of the 12th Battalion. It was funny seeing the tins & cans soar into the air. No one was hurt. There was a lot of artillery fire between 5 oclock & dark. At night the Turks tried to cut off the Queensland patrol, but did not succeed though young Reynolds was killed.\n","250":"\n\nFairly warm day. Was digging firing pits & sandbagging. One of our party Sam Odell was seriously wounded by a sniper & half an hour later Segt Tresilian our troop sergeant was killed\n","251":"\n\nshot through the head. He was a brave man & a good soldier, took risks where he wouldn’t let one of his troop. He was grazed by a bullet in the cheek in the morning. The Turks did a lot of firing at night & late in the afternoon there was a lot of artillery firing on both sides. \n","252":"\n\nWas deepening trenches both shifts. Things were very quiet today except for a bit of artillery fire.\n","253":"\n\nVery warm day. Finished deepening our firing line. The monitor put in a few heavy shells into the Turks in front of us & a cruiser further south got on to a party of Turks & gave them a rough time. Got a letter from mother.\n\nSaturday 24th\n\nStarted sapping a tunnel out towards the Turks whose front trenches are about 40 yards away. 3 or 4 of our chaps got hit today including Lieut Robson who died about an hour later. The Turks\n","254":"\n\nexchanged shots with the Queensland outpost. One man got hit.\n","255":"\n\nHad a fairly good sleep in the morning We got 3 high explosive shells from the Turks but no one was hurt. There was a good deal of shrapnel in the afternoon. We are making good progress with the tunnel 22 ft when we knocked off at 8 pm. Was served out with a good rum issue after tea. Today we had fresh meat, rice & milk.\n","256":"\n\nJoe Woods got wounded in the leg with shrapnel. Over 30 men in B Squadron out of 90 paraded to the doctor this morning & he said the Regt would soon have to have a spell as the men were worn & tired after so much hard work. Did not go on afternoon shift. We were allowed 12 hrs off after inoculation which was 2 days ago. There was a lot of artillery fire after 6 oclock both high explosive shrapnel.\n","257":"\n\nDid the usual 2 shifts on the tunnel, making fairly good progress.\n","258":"\n\nJim Ryan went away sick. He had been crook for a fortnight. We are getting fresh meat again now, also milk & rice occasionally. Some mail came in only got 1 paper. Went for a swim after tea.\n","259":"\n\nIt was fairly hot to day. Things are pretty quiet here all along the line except artillery which has been more active than usual. The 4th LH relieved the 7th. The Turks turned on a lot of shrapnel & several high explosive shells on to us about 5 oclock. Morris Reid of our troop were both wounded & it is believed Morris died later on. Scotty Wilson was also wounded in the leg. Was warned for General’s body-guard with 7 others in the Regt so didn’t go on sapping this afternoon.\n","260":"\n\nThe Guard fell in at 10 am\n","261":"\n\nat Brigade HQrs, but weren’t wanted till 10 pm.

We reached Imbros Is about noon & found a fine harbour with several supply ships cruisers, battleships monitors (3 of the latest pattern with 14 in guns) & a couple of destroyers. There is a lot of activity here – thousands of Tommies. We marched round to Genl HQrs & got donkies to carry our packs. We were issued with new clothes, burnt our old ones & had a good swim. There is plenty of fresh water here, so after a good wash & new clothes we all felt new men again. Turned in early for a good sleep\n","264":"\n\nSunday 1st August\n\nTurned out again at 6 am after a good nights rest & at 6.30 went for a swim. There was a fresh sea on & it was a treat. Came back & had breakfast. After breakfast got cleaned & shaved & attended church parade, at which Sir Ian Hamilton & his staff were present. He is a slightly built man & looks a fair age. He inspected us afterwards & seemed much pleased with our appearance. Said we looked very well after 3 months active service.\n\nMonday 2nd August\n\nHad an easy day. Went out on the motor launch in the afternoon & got some luxuries in the shape of chocolate fruit etc. Was on fatigue at night unloading boxes.\n\nTuesday 3rd\n\nWent over & inspected the aviation depot & had the parts of an aeroplane detailed. The mechanics were very decent. We borrowed the pontoon\n\nin the afternoon & rowed out to HMS Talbot We got a good supply of stuff there.\n","265":"\n\nDid nothing all day but sleep, read & smoke. There seems to be a lot of preparations going on for a big move.\n","266":"\n\nHad a washing day. First time Ive had a chance to do some in fresh water since we left Maadi.

It seemed quite strange marching a beat again & I didn’t go too much on it.\n","267":"\n\nCame off guard at 6 pm.

There was a big advance & it is believed a large body of troops were landed successfully\n","268":"\n\nat Suvla Bay\n\nSaturday 7th\n\nThe bombardment still continues at 10.30 it was one continuous roar. Achi Baba was the principle object & the peninsular looked as if it was in a dust storm. In the afternoon we rowed out to the transport Tringa & got some stores. The RNA Service were on board & they treated us well, gave us tobacco etc. The night was fairly cool. A destroyer brought in a load of Turkish prisoners about 500\n","269":"\n\nThere was no service this morning. The minister was too busy with the casualties of which there are many.

We arrived at Suvla Bay & were surprised to see all that had been done there. There were several warships & a big monitor. The \"Talbot\" & \"Venerable\" did a lot of firing & the land batteries assisting. There was an engagement on a big hill on the left which lasted a couple of hours. We left Suvla Bay at about 3.30 & got to Anzac about 4. It seemed strange coming back. We hadn’t gone far before Beachy Bill greeted us.

Went into the firing line at 7 pm. Things were very quiet. The Turk hardly fired a shot. Major Oatley came along & rather surprised me by asking if I would put my name in for a commission in the infantry.

The day was very quiet. Wrote a letter to Cousin Meg. The destroyer patrolling our right flank put in a lot of shells during the night. It was quite impressive seeing them burst & the search light illumine the smoke.\n\nFriday 20th\n\nThe English mail came in to day. I got 2 letters from mother dated 7th & 15th July. Things were very quiet all day on our front. There was some fighting\n\nAugust \nJuly\n 1915\n\non the left. In the south things have been quieter than usual.\n\nSaturday 21st\n\nPosted 4 letters. I wrote to Cousin Meg & Doug, Kate & Mother. Was taken out of the firing line at 3 oclock & at 4 oclock went on sapping again.

At night about 9 oclock a red\n","279":"\n\nflare went up at Chatham’s posts & a green one at the Lone Pine. Immediately there was heavy firing & the artillery joined in also a destroyer on the right flank. I think it was only a demonstration they were making. The firing lasted about half an hour.\n\nMonday 23rd\n\nA beautiful clear cool morning. We got orders to go out with the squadron when they filed out of the trenches. At 1.30 pm C Squadron relieved us & we occupied the back fire trench. I was posted on the observation post with 2 others for 24 hours. You can get a great view of the Turkish trenches & can see practically all the right & cemtre of our position. Things were very quiet. There was a good deal of bomb throwing at the Lone Pine where there is \n\nAugust 1915\n\nonly a barricade between us & the Turks\n\nTuesday 24th\n\nWas taken off observation at 9 am. The weather has turned very windy & looks rainy. Had the rest of the day off & had a good sleep. There is a heavy bombardment going on at Cape Hellas about the most continuous I have yet heard.

He has been here a fortnight now with reinforcements for the 7th LH. Went for a dip in the briny after tea. We had a little rain during the night. About 10 or 11 oclock there was a tremendous outburst of rifle & machine gun fire, also bombs & it lasted quite while. Seemed to be on the left of the Lone Pine.\n\nFriday 27th\n\nAbout stand-to in the morning there was another burst of fire. Seems as if they are doing some scrapping on the left. The weather is still cloudy & cool. We heard that Italy has declared war on Turkey & that Greece & Bulgaria may come in at any moment. We won’t be sorry\n\nAugust 1915\n\nas it will help to get this over more quickly. Was on Barney’s Post. Did 3rd shift. I have been put down as troop bomb thrower Lamberth having gone away sick. Had a yarn with the Dorrigo boys in the afternoon.\n\nSaturday 28th\n\nCame off Barney’s Post at 5 am. Had a sleep till breakfast. Was on fatigue with the engineers cleaning up in the tunnel where a couple of shells broke it in. It took us all day to get it fixed up. Went on water fatigue after tea.\n\nSunday 29th\n\nHad a fairly easy day. 2 Squadrons of the 12th LH came over to reinforce our Brigade. \n\n14 out of our Regiment were sent away sick. The 12th LH arrived yesterday. Arthur Blomfield is in A Squadron I believe & they went over to reinforce the 1st LH on the left.

About 8 pm there was heavy rifle & machine gun fire mostly to the left. I dont know if any attack was on.\n\nWednesday Sept 1st\n\nA cool cloudy day. There was a lively artillery duel in the morning. 2 chaps in our troop Snowden & Watts got wounded with shrapnell. Watts only slightly. We had fried steak for dinner today the first fresh meat for some time. Gee was wounded in the afternoon. Had his arm torn about badly.\n","285":" \n\nWe had a quiet day. The 6th sent their first lot of men up to Lone Pine for 48 hours. It is a fairly warm corner & takes some holding.

Sent a PC to Carrie & wrote to mother & Doug. We had some practice at bomb throwing.\n\nSaturday 4th\n\nThe 2nd Brigade sent a big lot of men to the Lone Pine. They expect the Turks to attack either tonight or tomorrow. I went up with 2 others from B Squadron as bomb throwers. We took over about 1am. Saw George Steggles mate when passing the 1st Battalion. The reserve trenches smell something awful & there are still a lot of dead lying about that they havn’t been able to bury. The slaughter must have been terrible. Men are buried in the trenches, being blocked up with sandbags & the flies are in millions. However you soon get used to the smell & after a while hardly seem to notice it. Some\n\n20 Turks rushed part of the trench held by the","287":" Battalion with bombs & killed & wounded a few. One Turk a tremendous big fellow got into the trench & got into grips with one of the sergeants. Some other assisted & held him down & another shot him.

I went on at 9 oclock but it was fairly quiet then. Came off at 11 & went on again from 3 till 5 am.\n\nSunday 5th \n\nHad a quiet day in the support trenches. There is not much chance of sleeping as there are so many men in the trenches. We sat about & smoked & yarned & discussed whether John Turk would make his proposed attack. Anyway we got a big supply of bombs handy\n\n& after dark we began to throw them & kept it up at regular intervals all night. In our sap alone we threw over 200 bombs. Another chap in the 5th LH got hit, but not very badly. We got several bombs well in to the Turks trenches. George Steggles came round during the day & I had a yarn with him for some time. He doesn’t care too much for Gallipoli, but then who does!\n\nMonday 6th \n\nCame off duty at 5 am & got a couple of hours sleep in. Saw a Queenslander from the observation post shoot a Turk who was in a trench on the left which this post commands. Another Turk came in to help his comrade out, but the Queenslander wouldn’t shoot him. We were relieved at 10 am by some men of our Brigade. Reported back to the Regt at 11. Some of the 6th Infantry Brigade arrived yesterday\n","289":"\n\nThey are wanted badly as the 1st Brigade has lost a lot of men & some of the Battalions are little more than a quarter strength. Had a spell the rest of the day & the night off.\n","290":"\n\nJim Ryan went sick so I took his place on tunnel guard. It is a good job, better than observing.

They replied with rifle fire for some time & were using a lot of explosive bullets.\n","291":"\n\nToday was beautifully cool. The most remarkable thing about it was the absence of artillery fire of the Turks. They did not attempt to reply to our own guns. One of the new monitors fired a lot of 14 inch\n","292":"\n\nshells on to Kilid Bahr. The Turks replied with shrapnel. The monitor kept firing nearly all morning.

The Genl I heard describing his experiences. The boat he was on was torpedoed. It was bringing to Lemnos some of the 6th Inf Brigade. He said there was no confusion whatever. Col Linton & a few others were drowned. The Turkish artillery have been very quiet lately. This afternoon our artillery sent a good few rounds across, but the Turkish reply was very weak.\n","296":" \n\nThe navy bombarded in the south again this morning, but I don’t think it was followed by any infantry attack.

It snowed nearly all day Sunday & it was bitterly cold & windy at night.\n","360":" to","361":"\n\nThe snow ceased Sunday night, but Monday was a freezing day in\n","362":" –","363":"\n\nspite of the little sun there was. There was an issue of cardigans & I got a sheep-skin W-coat. 10 Wproof capes were issued to each troop. We also had a rum issue & 2 tobacco issues during the week. No mail of any sort came here. We have been without Australian news for a fortnight. The weather warmed up towards the close of the week the last 3 days being cloudy with no wind or rain. We had rum every morning, but only ¼ & ½ issues of water. We are also getting Maconochie’s rations which are making things better also some cheese. Bread & fresh meat is seldom on issue. On our flank things have been quiet. Only the usual bombing & artillery duels. The cold weather has played up with a lot of the men & several have been sent away with Reumatics There was a big movement on the left flank I heard the line was extended & that there\n","364":"\n\nwere a lot of casualties. On Saturday there was a big bombardment by the warships of the Achi Baba Ridge & I believe a successful advance followed\n","365":" to","366":"\n\nThe weather during the week has been quite warm. Things have been fairly quiet except for a few bombardments & artillery \"hates\". On Tuesday we got some mail, both English & Australian. I received a parcel from a cousin Miss Sutherland & also letters from Doug & Uncle JD. Also wrote letters to mother, Doles Blair & Miss Sutherland. A lot of troops have been withdrawn during the week. On Thursday several warships bombarded some new Turkish gun emplacements & it proved the biggest bombardment I have yet seen here. Our squadron were out at Wilson’s Lookout on Monday Thursday & Sunday. Jean McCarthy of\n","367":"\n\nDeer Vale Dorrigo is pretty sick with jaundice & was sent to hospital The Infantry attached to us went away & we got a Squadron of the 5th Light Horse over with us.\n","368":" to","369":"\n\nWe were relieved at noon on Monday from Wilson’s Outlook where we put in a fairly quiet time. Except for heavy sniping & machine gun fire on our parapets they attempt little else. We keep the Jap mortar & the catapults going at intervals. The week has been generally warm with 2 or 3 chilly snaps which did not last ling. The one topic of conversation is the evacuation of Anzac & whether it will be successful or not. Our advance guard has left & we are getting anything we want supplied Dates, porridge, milk, McConochie’s rations etc in abundance, also cigarettes matches\n\nthings\n matches especially. Of course we were all glad to get the extra fare, but when we came to think we could get practically nothing in the cold weather except bully & biscuits, the waste seemed a shame. On Thursday our kit bags & blankets were sent away with a guard, only keeping back 1 blanket & an oilsheet each. Men are going away in large numbers every night, sick men going first or any that are a bit week. By Saturday night the line was very thinly held All our batmen, cooks, Mess orderlies QMasters etc having gone.. Only about 70 men were left of our regiment & in other places whole brigades had been taken, leaving only a few to keep up a bit of sniping. A few guns were left to keep firing as usual\n","370":"\n\nAeroplanes were up every day continually so as to keep any Taube away. The place looked very deserted by Sunday & in the morning the Turks shelled us with a big gun they must just have put in. They fired about 30 rounds 8.20 I think they were. Very little damage was done & very few casualties as there were so few men left 1 man to each 10 yds of trench the last day. The last party that left consisted of about 35 picked men to form a covering party. It will be on them to cover the evacuation of the others & then get away themselves On the last night, \nSunday\n the men were divided in 3 parties A party left at from 5 to 6 pm B party 9 to 10 pm & C party (covering party 2 to 3 am) & each party again was divide into 3 each\n\nunder an officer. I was in B, 3 party & left the firing line at 5 past 10 pm There was no hitch & we embarked at 11.15 pm. Only the covering party were left & everything seemed just as usual. Beachy Bill only fired a couple of shells as We were taken out on a steam lighter to the SS \"Alcha Ora\" a fast cross channel steamer. It was nearly 2 am when we left Anzac & everything was still as usual. We reached Lemnos at daylight, after spending a cold cramped night on the steamer However, I slept as I was fairly tired having been continuously on duty for 32 hrs previously. Lemnos Harbor is a fine harbour & it was crowded with shipping of all sorts including about a dozen battleships, with cruisers\n\nDecember 1915\n\ndestroyers & monitors. We were transhipped from the Alcha-ora to the \"Campanelle\" a big transport which was being used as a depot ship. About 3 in the afternoon we were again transferred to the NZ SS Cos \"Hororata\" which proved to be a fine transport splendidly fitted up for troops & on which we hoped we would be allowed to remain. But on Tuesday morning we were shifted on to the \"Auchises\" in heavy rain. We were getting tired of all these removals, but this time we were fixed up. Things were pretty rough the first night & after a lot of trouble we got some tea. At 5 pm we lifted anchor but on nearing the harbour entrance came into collision with another vessel which tore a boat down & smashed the rails a bit. We had to drop anchor &\n\ndid not get under weigh till the following morning at 10 oclock. Owing to us being so crowded in the sergeants mess, we petitioned for the Australians to have a mess of our own Our Brigade Captain & Capt Ryrie fixed this up for us & we were shifted to comfortable quarters & 2nd class accommodation which proved to be luxury after Anzac. Most of the other troops on board were English & Scottish Yeomanry, there being a lot of Scottish Horse on board, I inquired after Charlie McQueen & found several chaps that knew him. We had practically nothing to do on board except provide guards. The MG Sections getting most of that in case submarines should be sighted. On Thursday we heard that the Evacuation of Anzac\n","371":"\n\nwas a complete success only 3 men being wounded. The Turks did not find out & I believe shelled heavily next day. We heard also that Greece & the Bulgarians had come into conflict.\n","372":"\n\nPut in a very quiet day on board We sighted the \"Beltana\" in the afternoon. She left Lemnos 15 hrs before us. We are travelling very fast & taking a zig-zag course to avoid submarines.\n","373":"\n\nArrived at Alexandria early in the morning & took the pilot aboard at daylight. We did not draw alongside till noon. We were served with a splendid Christmas dinner on board. At 4 pm the Light Horse disembarked & the train left for Cairo at 6 pm. We had a terrible bumpy journey, but managed to knock out\n\na bit of fun. One of the NZealanders had a flare pistol & some flares, with which we frightened the dickens out of the niggers. \n\nSunday 26th\n\nArrived at Zeitoun about 2 am & had a 2 mile march We camped in a mess room for the rest of the night. Had no blankets but felt tired & slept fairly well on one of the mess tables. There was 95 of our Brigade. The rest are all split up in different parties. We got a good breakfast about 9 am & were practically the first to get back from the peninsular. The camps are much better than they were when we were here last & the quality of the food has likewise improved. We were well treated at Zeitoun, the cooks turning out & making tea. We also got a good breakfast & dinner, receiving a plum pudding each. All the boys have stuck together\n","374":"\n","375":" far. About 2 oclock we fell in & marched to Heliopolis, where we found the rest of our unit. We camped anywhere that night getting blankets issued. Had to make our own arrangements about cooking, there being wood water, meat, bread, tea & sugar, butter & tinned fruit. Most of the boys got into Heliopolis & Cairo & had a good time. 2 of them being put in the \"clonk\" for getting drunk. It was pretty hard on them after doing 7 months roughing it on the peninsular\n","376":"\n\nMustered most of our men in the morning ready to move off back to Maadi Most of them were pretty merry dirty & chatty. We marched out of camp to the Rly Station about 45 of B squadron which represented our full strength. We had a gay march to the station. What impressed me most was the huge number of soldiers\n\nabout who have never seen the front We did not make an impressive spectacle \nmarching?\n to the station. We were not an unruly mob, but the officers allowed some laxity. When we passed some well dressed new arrived the boys would shout Who’s Chatty\"! \nChorus\n I am! & Are we \"Kiwi\" soldiers \nAnswer\n No!\n\nAt Cairo, we had to march 2 miles through the town to Bab-el-ouk & we got a lot of Arab boys to carry our overcoats & rifles Most of us had no packs as we had to leave them behind us, except those that were sent away ahead & it is unlikely we will see them again. We got to Maadi about 4 oclock & jolly glad we were to get back.\n\nTuesday 28th \n\nWe all got paid £2\/11\/6 or 250 piastres. A lot of the old that had gone away sick had returned before\n","377":"\n\nus & a lot more marched into camp to day. We were given almost a freehand only 1 roll call per day & not much said if you werent there. Most of the boys were out for a good time & a fair amount of leave was granted. There was a lot of liqueur about. A big mail was in but I only got a couple of letters. I went into town at night but came out early. There was a huge crowd in town & you could hardly move for soldiers. It is much different to the old days.\n","378":"\n\nWe paraded in the morning 3 squadrons. Some of the troops had no more than 6 men on parade out of full strength of 36. In the afternoon we paraded & all the old hands were given the opportunity of coming into the regiment, if not they could stop in Maadi for a spell as it is\n\nlikely we will be away again in 2 or 3 weeks. The reinforcements were paraded & our regiment were brought up to strength again. Mr Dickson was made out troop officer & I am troop sergeant of C Troop B Squadron We got our rolls fixed up & then were dismissed.\n\nThursday 30th\n\nWe got our saddlery out & inspected the horses & allotted one to each man the old hands being allowed their own horses back again if they wanted them. I took mine. The saddlery was not in the best of condition so we could not have a mounted parade. In the afternoon we went out on troop drill & were also allotted tents 3 to each troop. Squadron Sergeants also had a tent. A lot of parcels were distributed today. We have plenty\n","379":"\n\nof cake, lollies, chocolate & tobacco. We have had so much good stuff given to us lately that I can hardly bear the sight of sweets. Clothes are what I principally want as my kit bag was practically empty (ie the black kit bag I left behind when I went away Got 5 letters today 2 from home & 1 from Mrs Vale & Doug & 1 from Meg & a parcel of chocolates from Kate. Went to the pictures in Maadi at night.\n\nFriday 31st\n\nWas pretty busy in the morning making up nominal roles duty roster & requirements for each man & horse so that we will be properly equipped. More parcels from the Regimental Comfort Fund arrived today. It is a pity we didnt get them at Gallipoli. We are fairly inundated\n","380":"\n\nin them here. The sergeants mess in this camp is very good & I am putting on condition daily.\n","381":"\n\nNew Years Day; No holiday for us. We are down to hard work reorganising & there is a lot of work to do. Received more letters & parcels. Wrote to Doles. Had a splendid dinner. Turkey & ham & Xmas pudding & drinks. Many of the lads got leace & went into Cairo on leave. Met Les Whipp of Croydon Park. He recognised me first. Was jolly glad to see him as I hadn’t met a cobber for a long time.\n","382":"\n\nGot leave for the day & with SQMS Cheater & Cpl Suffolk hired a car for a fiver & had a day out. Drove into Cairo\n","383":"\n\nTook lunch with us & went on out to the Barrage, 20 miles from Cairo where we lunched & wandered round the gardens, which are very extensive & beautiful. The Nile River flows through here it is the River is locked by huge gates which are opened in time of flood. Over lunch we drove back to Cairo & went out to a hospital at Ghezireh to see a cousin of Jim Suffolks. We spoke to some very nice nurses & would have liked to have taken a couple of them out for a drive. We had a look at the Zoological Gardens. They are well kept & have a splendid collection of animals. We had tea at York House & afterwards met several acquaintances. At 9.30 pm we left Cairo & got back to camp at 10 pm.\n\nMonday 3rd \n\nHad a busy day. We mounted at 9.15 & the horses went very well. They seemed very pleased to get out for a run. In the afternoon it rained fairly hard, so we cleaned up our rifles. Wrote some letters at night & did not get to bed till late.\n","384":"\n\nAnother mounted parade in the morning. We had our horses going at the trot & everything is going on well. The reinforcements drill very well. There was more rain in the afternoon. We got paid I drew £15 & also got an outfit of clothes. Wrote more letters at night & sent some photos away\n\n"}}
