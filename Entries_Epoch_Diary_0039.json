soon settled down to work; marched to Nefiche Station during morning & again in the afternoon with our packs up. Nefiche is the junction of the Suez, Cairo & Port Said lines, about 2 miles from where we are at present camping. Soon found my way to the Lake at Ismailia for a swim & afterwards endeavoured to gain admission to the aerodrome. Was successful in passing the guard, but as soon as our presence was discovered inside we were very soon put out.\n","2":"\n\nQuartermaster’s Fatigue, which necessitated going with waggon to A. S. Corps to draw rations; a fairly easy day, finished about\n\n7.30 A.M. & was exempt from duty the remainder of the day. Concert at Y.M.C.A. at night by the boys of the N.Z. Stationary hospital who are camping near to us.\n","3":"\n\nOut again in full marching order, as usual, marched past Nefiche. Any amount of rumour flying about as regards our time of leaving.\n","4":"\n\nOut in full marching order. Instructions received to remove all clothing from our Universal kits, other than our biscuit uniform. A great pity to see all the fine clothing that was destroyed; it certainly could have been made use of instead of putting it in the incinerator. Had to hand one of our two blankets into quarter store; one is quite sufficient here though, for it is now\n\nvery warm & as well we have to carry our blanket when on the march we are not anxious for more than one. Piquet duty to-night, drew first shift. Retained our sheep skin vests up till the present, all through the hot weather, & now when we are off to a cold country, of course it is quite in keeping with the ways of the military to get rid of them , which we certainly had to do.\n","5":"\n\nFoot & hand inspection. Tedious day on piquet, for they again enforced the four hour shift. Returned from piquet at 7 pm.\n","6":"\n\nOur tents struck; now sleeping in a shed, which has just been erected as a mess shed. Daily wittness some very interesting manoeuvres by the\n\naeroplanes which ascend from the aerodrome each morning & afternoon leaving no stone unturned to be in readiness to move when the time arrives; this morning we loaded & again unloaded limbers to ascertain their carrying capacity. Went to Y.M.C.A. at night.\n","7":"\n\nOur new skipper making matters rather warm; this morning half a dozen of us were given pack drill after the section had been dismissed, for very trivial matters. Unfortunately, I appeared on parade with a button undone, subsequently I was given pack drill; he is a bit over the odds. Very warm again to-day.\n","8":"\n\nWhole day cleaning harness & generally preparing for inspection by General\n\nMcKay tomorrow. Issued with bully beef which we were told to be very careful of while eating, for it has been known to contain metal hooks, probably inserted by the huns; needless to say we did not indulge in any of it.\n","9":"\n\nInspection by General McKay. \n\nVery tiresome standing with full packs up for almost an hour waiting to be inspected. Fully expected to be leaving here to-night, but were greatly disappointed when we were informed that our departure had been postponed indefinitely. It is considered unsafe to attempt to cross the Mediterranean at present, owing to the presence of commerce raiders & submarines. Some of the Infantry lads ran\n\nwild tonight & raided the canteens practically pulling some down, there was no occasion for an act of that description for the prices charged were as reasonable as could be expected here. All the mules we have been carrying on our strength for some time, were today struck off our strength & entrained for Alexandria.\n\nPaid 100 piastres (£1.0.6.)\n","10":"\n\nMarch with full packs up.\n\nSince our arrival in this camp the food has been very poor; practically the worst food we have had during our stay in Egypt; complaints have been lodged by a few of the boys & we are in hopes of improvement from date. Piquet again to-night\n\nnow doing shifts of 2 hours on & 4 off. During afternoon were given a few points by Capt Lind on Entraining & Embarking.\n\nMail opened again to-day.\n","11":"\n\nSix months today since our arrival in Egypt; six months too long. \n\nMeeting of sports committee in connection with Brigade sports which are to take place on Saturday. Relieved from piquet 7 pm.\n","12":"\n\nSports meeting in connection with our unit to ascertain likely competitors in Brigade sports to-morrow. 9 am helmet practice afternoon parade.\n","13":"\n\nBrigade sports day, some very\n\ninteresting & exciting events contested. Our transport entered for the best turned out general service limber, & much to the delight of all the unit; were successful in pulling off 1st prize; All looking forward now to the Divisional sports laid down for Tuesday next. Pitched tents again which were struck about 8 or 9 days ago, prior to our anticipated departure.\n","14":"\n\nChurch parade; reference made to the death of Lord Kitchener\n","15":"\n\nThe whole of the unit marched to the palms on the opposite bank of the lake at Ismailia, where we spent a very pleasant morning at our leisure, returning to camp at 12 noon. Have been given very little work since the postponement of our departure.\n","16":"\n\nDivisional sports which were to have been held today, have been postponed till tomorrow, on account of memorial service Lord Kitchener. Service held at 6 pm; very impressive. Tents again struck & this time we are quartered in a marquee, previously used as a hospital. Piquet from 7 pm\n","17":"\n\nTwelve months to-day since I enlisted. \n\nDivisional sports day; on piquet, but obtained permission to attend.\n\nOur unit again took first prize for best turned out limber, against allcomers of the Division. Relieved from piquet 7 pm.\n","18":"\n\nSpent the morning in the lake swimming. Detailed for duty at railway siding 5 pm where I remained till 9 pm\n\nloading our wagons on the train. Two small parties of the unit entrained to-night; one under Col Sheperd & the other under Capt Irving for Alexandria to embark, SS Rhesus.\n","19":"\n\nCamp taken over by 14th F. Amb. Remained in vicinity of Camp till 9 pm, when we moved away to Moascar Siding, where we entrained on open goods trucks & left about 10.45 amid great rejoicing.\n","20":"\n\nSpent rather a cool night on the goods truck; arriving at the end of our journey about 7 AM, none the worse for our trip. After a considerable delay we embarked & were stowed right below in very unhealthy quarters. The boat is one of the Cunard line (\"Transylvania\") which previously travelled to New York, but is at present in a very filthy\n\nstate below. Allotted to messes & issued with lifebelts which we either have to wear or carry about during the day & use as a pillow at night. Slept on deck, conditions practically unbearable below. When we retired we were still at anchor waiting to put to sea.\n","21":"\n\nPut to sea at 10 AM. Owing to number of troops on board, the meals are carried out in three sittings.

Lots of the boys knocking up.\n","147":"\n\nAll went out at 12 noon to take up the farthest posts for 30 hours. Very quiet during night. Feeling much the worse for wear.

Have heavy cold & slight trench feet but stuck it out. Went out again to the posts, but work getting harder each day. Quite a common occurrence to get stuck in the mud while carrying a stretcher. Received a few letters prior to leaving camp but owing to heavy work from the time we took over post from 15th F Amb, was unable to read them till late at night. Expect to be relieved by a second division amb to-morrow. Five of 15 F Amb wounded by shrapnel a few minutes after we relieved them.\n","156":"\n\nFairly busy day.

Had to again go on duty in lieu of 5th F Amb who failed to put in an appearance. Struck a stunt; 27 & 28 Btn\n\nwent over the top, gained their objective but had to retire again. Casualties very heavy. Fritz shelled very heavily around us & caught a battery close by.\n","159":"\n\nKept going continuously the whole of the night; rained about midnight & made work much harder.

Feel the strain of short rations.\n","160":"\n\nMarched away from Green Dump at 8.30 AM; pleased to get away from the continuous roar of the heavy guns. The work which we have been carrying out during our period of\n\nduty here, has been very hard owing to the distance of the carry & the mud & rain. Have been working on front in vicinity of Flers, Guerdecourt & Le Sars. Have been wet for the whole of the time we have been here & have very rarely had the opportunity to wash or shave.

Never had a wink of sleep. General Mackay passed here on a visit towards the line early this morning.

No men allowed to sleep in cellars till further notice.\n","291":"\n\nVillage of Doignies taken by 55th & 56 Btns, but they suffered fairly heavily in doing so.

Two of Fritz’s planes brought down earlier in the afternoon.\n","293":"\n\nPractically all the casualties through from the stunt. Fritz shelled heavily during the day all around our post; gave artillery around rough time. Expect to be relieved to-morrow by 1st Division.
