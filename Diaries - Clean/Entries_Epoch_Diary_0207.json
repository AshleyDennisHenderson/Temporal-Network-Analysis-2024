Melbourne today, my word how absolutely disgusted I am with the send-off we've been given. Yes, it doesseem a pity.\n","2":"\nLeft Melbourne or rather Hobson'sBay at 11 & cleared the at 12.30 with much of swell around.Posted 2 letters to Elsiealso one to Knights enclosing£1.20, received letter from Appleby, also a parcel from Humphrey . Plenty of handsill especially of men. We had logged up to 50 miles at 5 o'clock not bad going for this old tub. The wirelessesalready. Today I heard our ultimate destination was Aldershotof course it is only a rumor. on board this morning to make a final inspection and what hooted. Um, a very bad start.\n","3":"\nThe BadgingTrain has had its first Casualty last night the kangaroo mascot had a fall andtoday he was skinned and put overboard very hard luck. After looking at the log this previous we found we had travelled 247 miles for 24 hoursrun not bad going. The ship is quanderingbeing made ship shape, and before I am not sorryfor at present things are rotten,so far the food is pretty good we having fish last night for tea,grilled sausages this morning and boiled rabbit for lunch ending up with stew for tea tonight. We feelthere isplenty of work, more sothan the and we are kept going fom 6.30 am every day feeding up etc. Today we have had all our fire stationsgiven us and all information re fire etc given us, well I am now turning in.\n","4":"\nChurch Parade this morning and up we were free for the rest of the day. My word the sea is beginning to ragenow and all hands have been slidingall over the place,the companionway being ofan indescribable scene of amusement for lads are continually falling over, and generally they are burdened with the mealof their mates. I have written my first weeks news to Elsie today. I suppose it will appear a little dry because news is hard to scrapeup. Well goodnight my little friend, whomI trust is in safe keeping.\n","5":"\nCasualty No 2 today. We have sustained our second casualty in the shape of a horsethis time and we had a fineopportunity of witnessing a little veterinary work for our Vet cut him open to prove the theory of his death. Of course there was an offensive smell which cleared a lot of inquisitive parties who had unhealthynotions of seasickness thus enabling me to obtain a photo of the Vet at work. What amused me most of all was the taking of horseshoes off the horses feet before putting him for the sharks. We had our first lifebelt parade today and were detailed off to our boat stations, our fire stations we alrfeady know. Had a nasty turn today of feverand to top it all had a lovely fallwhen the ship was rolling badly bruising my leg shin bone. Much to my pleasure I think we are about in the middle of the Bight at present but the sea is not abating in the least.\n","6":"\nNot an uneventful day oh no! early in the day 3 ammy \"hammock\"carried away andI found myself deposited very heavilyon the deck, of course I was pleased.\n\nAbout 10 am we sighted a sail on the Port Bow, the original name of which is not known to us. The authorities have decided to vaccinate us and I for one refuse but my turn I think will come tomorrow. My word you would hardly credit the quietitude of the sea, there being only thelazyswell of the ever restless ocean; so I think that we have made good passage for today.\n\nI had a very nasty fallyesterday and was dressed today at the surgery. We have had anotherspecial Evolutiontoday; i.e. Abandon ship.Wellmy toothache is still proceeding at its unabated rate.\n","7":"\nAt 5 am we sighted Breaksea Island\nIsland\n and passed the same at 6 Bells.Last night at 9.30 we were passed by two Japanese Cruisers steaming single line ahead; today another casualty - another horsedied of Gripes. This afternoon we went to fire stations, the Evolution being executed in 7 mins not bad. I had ample time on my hands this afternoon so I perused Elsie's Browning, very fine indeed.\n\nPassed Albany at 12 o'clock, also King George's Sound and expect to pass \"Leeuwin\"about 9.00 tonight. For the last two days, a Comet has been visible in an Easterly direction;it is a very fine sight indeed. Well Concert for tonight, so must pack up, so long until tomorrow. The time has altered \nfour\ntwo hours slower than Melbourne.\n","8":"\nWell I think I shall give up stating the Casualty List; for today we have lost 3 horses.\n\nGee we had some great fun today with the clipping machine, and by the time we had finished we were experts in its use, being able to cut 5 men's hair in 11 minutes, not to dusty eh what. I had all my lovely? hair off, and saw a good opportunity to take a few photos which I did, also Doug took a few.\n","9":"\nOh yes, we lost another horse this morning, but there is a hope that we shall lose now more being expressed.\n\nWe have now settled into a strict routine on board, it is as follows, 5 a.m. up and rise, work until 7.30 a.m., \"ki ki\", 8.15 a.m., \"ki ki\" finished, 9 a.m.\"fall in\", 9.15 a.m., \"stand easy\" 11 a.m. until 11.10 am, dinner 12.15 p.m., commence work 2 p.m., stand easy 3 p.m. until 3.10 p.m., finis 4.15 p.m. \"feed up\" (3rd time) 4.30 p.m. \"ki ki\" 5.15 p.m., \"ki ki\" finis6 p.m., \"feed up\" 7.30 p.m., \"Stand by hammocks\" 8 p.m., lights out 10 p.m. \"pipe down\", not too bad! We don't actually work all the time but we have to be present &that is just about the same. We have been encountering a very heavy swell all day, but otherwise the sea is very calm. I took some photographs of a horse being clipped, in various stages.\n\nWell Elsie Doug & I have been discussing \"Weurook\", and its suppers etc.\n","10":"\nNo casualtys today thank goodnessbut goodness, the sea is rising and the seasick, (poor chaps) are all reclining into their old position i.e. on the rails. Any amount of work, practised two evolutions today, abandon ship, & fire stations, both of which we were very successful and called for praises from the Old Man. Had a sumptous tea tonight can hardly write stomach full. We do certainly have some exciting moments here why, only just now, a young chap \"heaved\" all over the chap nextme. Well Elsie little girl I am still thinking of you dear.\n","11":"\nThe usual Sunday routine has been rigorously and we all feel benefited by the fine Service delivered by the Chaplin.\n\nThe usual happening another horse \"kicked it\". My horse is not feeling too good and he certainly looks bad, poor fellow.I have spoken to the Veterinary Surgeon about him, but you might just as well, put water on a Duck's back.\n\nI have printed a few photos of myself, Snowy Lang and Billie Longdale also \"Binny\" & Elsie, which I am forwarding on to Elsie by this mail. Well, this day four weeks ago I was at home on final leave and had visited Mrs Ladd.The \"Geelong\" is a day ahead of us and the \"Westalia\", a day behind.\n","12":"\nAnother horse gone today,1 less to look after. Began a letter to Elsiemail box opened for letters, have not posted mine yet. Paid 9\/- today, I believe for the last 3 days in Melbourne. Met a young chap who was aquantied with Trellis (Elsie's brother). Con is in hospital, yet. Sang last night at the concert, did not do bad.\n","13":"\nMy horse \"kicked the bucket\" to-day, poor old \"Dommy\", he is gonehard luck \"Snowy\". Itook his photo going over the side.\n\nWe took to excercising horses to-day and two chaps were badly kicked in the operation.\n\nWell preparations are being made for \"crossing the line - and of course I am going to be \"shoved in\", but what does it matter, when it is all sport for the others.\n\nIt is the general thought that we are going to go to Portsmouth or Devonport and perhaps we will visit \"Chatam\" . Exceedingly tired tonighthave been going hard all day and have not slept for the last two nights, for I have been dreaming of you Elsie.\n\nDouglas says that if he wants to think of Ivanhoe he is going to sleep alongside of me. Goodnight dear Mother. We are out of touch with Australia by wireless to-day at 10 p.m.\n","14":"\nLost two horses to-day, and I have a new job for a few days, writing in the office. Have been having great fun today with a greenhorn kidding him that we were crossing the line and all hands would have to push \"the line\" down so as the boat could pass over it. All preparations for a good days sport very soon now. The difference in the Melbourne time is 4 hours, faster than this time.\n","15":"\nInspection of all Arms to-day.No deaths amongst the horses, but the stokers all went on strike, just giving the boat sufficient steam to get steerage way on. P.O. Jack very liable to be disrated, a dash good job if he does. Plenty of work here at present. Wrote to Mrs Adam & Mother just giving the general news, a chap sangthe Perfect Day to-night at the concert.\n","16":"\nLost 2 horses today, and had a bit of a concert. Went to \"Abandon Ship\" Stations and had a generally energetic day. Had a scrap with one chap, my mare is not to good.\n\n\n\n\n","17":"\nGreat excitement, a firebroke out in the Fore Peak but was put under with great speed, just as well, 2 horses died today otherwise same old thing.\n","18":"\n12 midnight, the ship suddenly altered her course 8 points, -to Nthd, and is now steaming in the direction of Colombo where we expect to arrive, at 10.30 on Thursday next.\n","19":"\nAll dayto-day we have been steaming on our new course, doing 308 miles through a very steady sea.\n","20":"\nPassed first thing 8.30 this morning, a steamer going Sth, \"Premysl\" is her name, and crossed the Line, at 6.45 pm. Lost 2 horses.\n","21":"\nHad the Crossing the Line festivities to-day, very very funny, all took part as victims, I being included, much to my pleasure.\n","22":"\nSighted \"Agairna\" at 6.00 am and she altered her course, coming right across our stern, at 12.30, signs we are entering Colombo, 4.15 through a fine breakwater, two lights on the ends and several other lights further up. On our Port side there is a wreck or rather a boat on the beach. She was blown ashore there last\n\nSunday and belonged to the P & O Branch Service. There is a B.I. boat standing by her and she seems to be helping to salvage her. On our Starboard Bow, there is a fine lighthouse exhibiting a Green light and farther on a Pilot Station, away ahead a Russian Gunboat is at anchor and the H.M.S. \"Orvieto\" is being coaled by the little boys. There is a large Dutchman with his colors painted all over his bow, also a large number of other ships of various lines. A very fine Power Station and hotel surrounded by cocoanut palms are dots in the scenery of this nice little port.\n\nOne of the best sights that we were lucky enough to witness, was that of the \"Agina\", entering through the breakwater on a large swell and at the same time heeling right over on her Port Side.\n\nWe have received orders, to sail for Bombay at some time tonight, goodness only knows what for.\n\nThere has been a rising here, 800 being killed and we have heard that England is under conscription, a rotten shame if that is the case.\n\nThe \"Agina\" has just left 8.25 p.m. and she has received a fine send off from us, we are busy at present waiting for the Pilot, and he has now come aboard. We cleared the breakwater at 9.30, the searchlights of the Examination Service operatedfromthe breakwater flash onus at intervals. The \"Orvieto\" sailed at 6 p.m. making a very fine sight as she dipped to a light swell.\n\n\n","23":"\nOut at sea and steaming for Bombay where we hope to reach on Monday, next. Now news, save a great number of deaths in the horses.\n","24":"\nSighted the \"Againa\", also passed a B.I. ship steaming South. Lost 15 horses today, owing to a heavy sea on our beam.\n","25":"\nSunday, gee, rotten work today owing to having to heave dead horses overboard. Funniest sight I have ever seen today, for the ship has been rolling to 33ºangle rich eh what! Chased my dinner across the hatch yesterday, and have seen some lovely falls.\n","26":"\nPassed Bombay at about 5 this morning, lost 11 horses last night, we anchored in Bombay at 4 p.m. and have only seen the City from the sea.\n\nA Parsee's hatcaused great comment, and amusement amongst the boys, for it is on the same principle as the½\" in straw hats in the fashion in Sydney 12 mths ago.\n\n\n","27":"\nAfter cleaning up the ship and unloading horses all day, we were allowed ashore from 4 pm until 7 pm. We have had a good time in 3 hours having secured a \"Gari\" , we visited all the main buildings or rather some of them, including the Municipal Bldgs, Post Office, Yacht Club, Taj Mahl& numerous others. The M.B. are in Norton St and have a fine statue in the front of them. The Post Office is in a main thoroughfare, the name, I am not aware of.\n\nThe Taja Mahl is a magnificent Hotel situated in the Apollo Bundah .\n\nIn making a tour of the Crawford Market otherwise known as the \"English Bazaar\" we were treated to a fine time by our very voluble guide who showed us all there was to be seen in this particular portion of the City. I have posted cards to Elsie (5), Jean (1), Mother (1), Harry (1), Uncle (1) and also posted 2 scarfs to Elsie with a silk handerchief. There is a great deal of destitution & poverty here and the main cry of the women & kiddies is Salaam Sahib. Very tired after my strenuous day, so will lie up for a while.\n\n\n","28":"\nWrote to Elsie, Mother, Harry, Jean, Uncle also sent a silk Handkerchief & 2 Silk Wraps to Elsie,a Parsee has taken them ashore to the P. Office. 5 Chaps took a liberty with their \"leave\" and are \"in\" for desertion. One chap got 60 days for ? and another 30 days for ?! We left the Princes Dock at 1 o'clock the A 59, otherwise \"Botanist\"from Sydney was waiting to go in as we came out, and of course we exchanged some compliments. The men on board are from Sth Australia and are Light Horsemen. We anchored off the Wireless Stations Island at 2.10 pm and are at present taking in water from a B.I. & P. & O. boat.\n\nOne thing you notice is the immense quantity of trades that these companies indulge in and they appear to have the monoply of the shipping trades in the harbour. Before we drew out of the dock to-day the \"Dimbara\" a B.I. boat Homeward Bound, left before we did. I took some photos of the Dock, also this boat when they were tugging her into position, to enable her to steam through the narrow dock Gates, which I also photographed. I had the misfortune to spoil a roll of film, which included numerous photos of Colombo, and one or two here, gee but I was sorry.\n\n\n","29":"\nWe are coaling and watering in the same position as yesterday i.e. off Elephant Island, and we have been very busy doing some whitewashing in the horse stalls, which is a very nauseaus job, owing to the huge number of lice (horse) congregated on the boards. A Hindu came aboard with goods for sale, and this was the cause of some excitement while it lasted, which was for some considerable time. The old Hindus still have their sing sings whilst working like the New Guinea natives. Their method of coaling ship is funny although excellent and consists of scaffolding all the \nwharf\n way up the ships side and the coal is loaded in little baskets very quickly. So long, & Good night my Elsie.\n\n2nd\n July\n","30":"\nA meeting held today to decide that steps be taken to secure better treatment regarding leave and duties in port. Went ashore to-day, and viewed the Elyshanta caves, a full decription of which I received per, \"Sparks\". Things are taking a very ominous outlook, I think if a certain action is not taken on the part of Officers something will happen at our next port of call that will disgrace the Commander for a long time to come.\n","31":"\nAn absolutelyuneventful day save for one event, this being the sailing of the ship from Bombay. We up \"anchored\" at 8 a.m. and at 9.30 a.m. we had dropped the Pilot and were clear of the treacherous sandbanks with which the Harbour is abundant. Have been whitewashing all day and have had a series of deck games after tea. Wrote Elsie today, 5thweeks letter.\n","32":"\nNothing much to-day, the usual Sunday Routine was practised. At 7.55 p.m. the Donkeyman of the ship, died, and his death caused a good deal of comment from several of the lads. I hear he is to be buried tomorrow at 6.30 a.m. Had the comfort of smoking one of my presentation cigars in the cool of the evening. Passed Hospital Ship.\n","33":"\nHad our first burial at Sea today, the Donkeyman who has been ill for a long time died last night at 7.55 and we buried him at 6.30 this morning. He was afforded all Military honors and the \"Last Post\" was sounded with the usual volleys, the latter being rottenly executed. Sea has been on the beamall day, ship behaving well. Have been busywhitewashing today and am feeling rathertired. Today for the firsttime \"stand arms\" was sounded off and the routine has been changed all through.\n","34":"\nHave had a new occupationmat sweeping, washing, drying & rolling and it has been rather heavy full dress parade today, all uniforms and kit being inspected.\n","35":"\nWorking very hard today. Any amount of floats to sweep, wash & scrub so of course ratherhard. The weather very tiring heat similar to New Guinea and is slightly hotter. The water is a perfect deep blue and the wash is a light blue.\n","36":"\nStand Easy this afternoon, and as we really appreciated it. Wrote to McGee to-day, also a note to McMillan. Having a good time. Sea is very rough and we are doing 1 ahead of astern. We are 6 days out & have done only 700 miles, passed P.O. Boat going east.\n","37":"\nPassed a two funneled Steamer going West at 7 p.m. Straightened out Haricks', weather fine, all well. Very Hot. Wrote to Bolus.\n","38":"\nHad a little lecture from Shalles and appreciated same. Sea calmer to-day, very hot, plenty of shipping.\n","39":"\nDid not get too much sleep last night owing to the heat. At 9.15 p.m. we were off Perim, at the entrance to the Red Sea, and last night we passed andwere focussed by two searchlights, seeing in the distance Aden, at 11-00. Early this morning we passed an auxilary ketch and large tramp,also passed a fort on one of the 12 Apostles, that once was Turkish but since war was destroyed, by H.M.S. \"Ocean\". The Sea is a great deal calmer and has a scum, yellowish on the surface. A few porpoises and a great deal of whalesSpawn, also a number of\n\nDhows, that I suppose are bound for the Persian Gulf.Had a fine Service at Church Parade today, the text being immorality, and the Padre knew his subject.\n","40":"\nStill steaming through an intolerable atmosphere and have been busy all day working below. Passed at Sunset a Lighthouse on one of two very high islands. Saw a canoe in these parts. Passed numerous ships bound sth. Went into hospital today.\n","41":"\nHave been in bed with a bad attack of fever for the last day and am feeling shaky yet wrote to Mother also a letter for Ted.\n\n\n","42":"\nStill in Sick Bay, but have been allowed to come in and out at intervals. Passed a reef with a light on it, the land all along is very rugged and barren consisting mostly of sandy country.\n","43":"\nCame out of hospital this morning feeling good, passed close by a dry barren island with a light right on the point, a dry barren piece of land. At 9.45 pm we anchored in Suez. The only saving grace of the Scenery on view the whole way up this Sea was the exquisite Sunsets, on the hills of sand tonight for the first time we have had a glimpse of the silvery moon which is a new one and has just appeared above the sand cliffs. The lights of Suez twinkle in the distance, like full stars, and already pinnaces are hopping around creating a huge disturbance and as Wayback Joe says, sound as if someone was racing a motor cycle around the ship.\n\n\n\n\n","44":"\nWell since arriving last night, were everyone was anxious to know their future destination, and at 9 o'clock this morning, we were relieved to hear that we are going on to England and the Signallers are to go off here. Gee, the Signallers have disembarked, and we have given them one good send off. Our destination is only rumored of course and it is quite possible that we shall land in Egypt at Alexandria and certainly hope this is not so. At 4.30 pm we up anchored, and headed for the entrance of the Canal, at 4.55 we entered the Canal and on entering passed the Converted Cruiser \"Himalaya\", also the \"Mortcalm\" a French cruiser of New Guinea \nconnections\n memories, on our Port side coming up, are long walks and a huge flagpole. On passing the \"Montcalm\" we received a rousing hurrah, or rather a Hoop! Hoop! Hoorah in which the Admiral himself joined.\n\nAfter passing these ships we passed on our Starboard side a Garrison of Indian troops and their trenches and barb wire entanglements. One thing noticed is the action of the ship on the sides of the Canal, it consisting of a swish all the while.\n","45":"\nAfter 15 hours good steaming, we entered Port Said and moored along side an old tramp, very close to the Cruiser \"Juno\". The sights along the Canal were pretty, and numerous, the mail train, & etc.\n\nThere are at present 2 French Cruisers and a Hydroplane Depot with about 12 Hangars is visible.\n\nWe had a pleasant swim and I have unfortunately picked up a guard. We were afforded a pleasant view of the Hydroplanes at work in the Canal. The \"Juno\" sailed at 4.50 pm and steamed down the Canal. I thought very highly of the beautiful dredges that were busily at work.\n\nSwam ashore, and had a look around, at the train service and a little of Arab Town. Purchased ennumerable boxes of Turkish Delight and Cigarette Tobacco, also PCards. Elsie's 6thweek's letter today posted. We are bound we hear for Gibraltar. I took numerous photos and one of the Postman.\n\nVery disappointed at not having received any mail and so is everyone else. Well feeling rather tired tonight.\n","46":"\nUp anchored at 6 pm and left for ? rumored Lemnos Island or Alexandria. Wrote 18 P Cards to different people, began Elsie's 7thweeks letter. Saluted to French warships, and had a splendid view of the Quay, Obseratory and Statue of De Lesseps on the magnificent breakwater at the entrance to the harbour. Going on guard until 12 midnight. A Guard has been arranged to guard the ship against the likelyhood of Submarine attacks.\n","47":"\nNo Submarine attack yet, guard still vigilant. Have had a day of scurring up & down below and always when a ship is sighted, thence the day was passed without any event. The boats were slung outboard, and an alteration was made in the Boat Stations, also the abandon ship Signals given us. They were;one long blast \"prepare to abandon Ship\", 1 short blast \"Prepare to lower boats\", 2 short blasts, \"Lower away. Darken Ship\".\n","48":"\nAn absolutely uneventful day today, having a busy time, finished a letter to Mrs Adam, & Elsie, very busy. Darken ship, Good Bye.\n","49":"\nArrived at 11 am at the Island of Lemnos. As we steamed in the bay, and were piloted through the mine fields at the entrance, under skilful pilotage of an English T. Boat, we not lying at anchor, the huge liner \"Mauretania\" and \"Empress of England\", also about 30 battleships of the \"Formidable\" class, and their accompanying light & heavy cruisers, in all about 40. The Russian cruiser \"Askold\" noted in the Dardenelles raid. About 50 transport hospital ships, store ships, ballon ships, Hydroplane ships,and colliers also Oil Tanks.\n","50":"\nNothing startling today, save for our destination being pronounced as the Island of Ambrossa about 20 mls from the Dardanelles for 14 days training there. Thence to take part in an attack, a surprise, on a new portion of the Straits. Have heard today that Ian Hamilton is superseded by Smith Dorrien, also heard that 10,000 were killed and wounded in the attack on the Dardanelles, also heard that the Turks have been mutilateing our wounded, having gorged their eyes out, cut off their noses & ears. Very busy in the harbour here, troops going away all day, mainly the Algerians. Wrote to Elsie & have given it to Mr Watson to post in England.\n","51":"\n\"Mauritania\" sailed this afternoon. Heard this afternoon that Roy has been wounded in the Dardanelles and I have written Mother to let her know not to worry too much. Had a swim these last three days, very enjoyable. Gave Watson my camera today.\n","52":"\nLeft our anchorage at 6.45 and steamed for Ambrossa, just 20 miles for the Dardanelles. We went ashore this morning, called at all the hospitals in hopes of hearing something of Roy but could not find him anywhere.\n\nWhilst passing down the stream we passed three submarines at anchor, further down the stream we passed two subs, one steaming up the harbour and the other outside. Whilst going through the passage we were passed by a speed boat doing about 30 and quite noiseless about it too. This belonged to the Engineer in charge here.\n\nWhen ashore today I visited the church which was a beautiful piece of Grecian mouldwork, I also tasted some crushed grape juice which was very nice and acceptable.\n\nThere were wounded & sick of all nations in these hospitals 18,000 all told.\n\nHad a rather amusing experience whilst inquiring for Australians, in one tent I was answered with that when said, is there anyone here from Glasgow, their faces lit up with the broad smiles, when heanswered. After \"Empress of Britian\" sailed out with us.\n","53":"\nArrived at Ambrossa at 6.15 am, as we steamed in the Harbour through circuitous passages we noticed several Hydroplane ships and Balloners, also plenty of Storeships. The booming of guns could be heard all the morning especially during the Church Parade, which of course sounded much more solemn than usual. At 1.20 two Monitors of the new type steamed out and headed for the Dardanelles, they are floating fortresses, and looked formidable with there attendant mine sweepers (little trawlers) clustered about them, they looked the typical Mother Carey & her chickens.After their leaving about an hour some of there guns were plainly heard.\n\nAbout Sunset we wentin swimming in the blue Mediterreanen, this we enjoyed. Whilst we were in swimming a Torpedo Destroyer passed, also a trawler, on the latter there was a Melbournite & a Sydneyite, how we knew one of them mentioned the fact that Tooheys beer was the best whilst the former upheld the honor of Carlton Ale.\n\nWe are twelve miles from the firing line, and the men are champing at the delay and there is talk of us all volunteering for infantry for it does hurt one to hear the guns all the while and not to be able to see anything that is going on. At Sunset a Hydroplane was a very pretty sight.\n","54":"\nStill lying in this nice little harbour of Ambross, chafing at the unnecessary delay, and thank goodness today we have had a lecture on raft building from pontoons. Whilst we were having the lecture a yacht attached to the fleet whilst making the entrance of the mine field, ran down a cutter which was engaged in diving; two chaps were rather badly injured or rather looked to me to be pretty badly knocked about.\n\nWe had a try at the demonstration. It is reported that two Enemys aeroplanes were sighted and they had a shot to bomb the \"Flag\".\n\nAs we are turning in, a loud noise is to be heard, and the buzz of an aeroplanes propellers come clearly to our ears. Looking up hey presto, you see one of your own craft floating aloft, & poising like a hawk, waiting for her prey. It has been rumored that we are to leave the ship tomorrow, and train for fourteen days, a dash good job too. I have scribbled a nice long letter to you my dear, just 15 pages or so, so I hope you will receive it in due order, after it has past the Censors knife, and pleasure.\n","55":"\nHad a very strenuous day, hands working all night, Bunty being very tired I had a four hour watch on the Bridge. We began to unload the pontoons & lash them to the waggons & having completed this floated them alongside the ship; eventually towing them ashore. Another method was forming them into rafts and punting them ashore.\n\nA great number of hands went ashore this morning and a great number went ashore late at night.\n","56":"\nStill unloading the \"old tub\" and thank goodness will soon have the ship empty. Bunty went ashore at 1.30 am this morning. Les was in a boats crew and had a good mornings work, towing 5 pontoons. We expect to go ashore tomorrow.\n","57":"\nDisembarked & after hoisting all the Pontoons up on the beach, and managing to get all our gear up, showed the Kitcheners Army \"lot\" how to rig up a few tents in regular bush style. Our camp resembles to a great extent a Boudin Camp in the desert. There a 30,000 troops, here met a young chap who knew Roy. He said he was shot through the neck rather serious.\n","58":"\n\nLes Fuller birthday (21st) today and we had a royal time, preserved apricot, bully beef, assorted biscuits hard & soft, cheese & bread & jam we bought the extras and \"Queen Lizzie\" fired a royal salute, not for Lesley but for the Turks; we heard to-day that the Allied forces in the Persian Gulf had a complete success, completely routing the Turks and we soon hurried to get over the hills. The \"Chatam\", sister to \"King \" and \"Melbourne\" arrived today, and the \"Port Macquarie\" left at 7 o'clock. We viewed the bombardment from the ridge close to camp and for company, we had position ofSikhs, Gurkas & Punjabi regimentswho love the Australians and his opinion in this manner, like English, his much pointing to the length of his finger, Australia this much showing the full length of their arms. Had sectional and detachment drill, pretty solid work; still waiting on mail.\n","59":"\nCompleted a section of a bridge each 200 ft in length, not so bad, for a new chum, eh! Began to teach Dave to swim. Bunty still alive and keeping busy, had a row with Desruck and was put in the rattle, collected a R.A.M.C. badge this morning for a B.B.T. badge. Gave my whips to Ray's pal.2 more submarinesparent ships came into port today.\n","60":"\nHave had a vey strenuous day owing to a gale springing up in the night. The pontoons which were moored at the waters edge broke their moorings and were swamped, work gee whiz any amount of it. Still busy collecting badges & getting on well. Doug has been a little sickly today, caused by the rotten water. Had an attack of malaria however just a slight one½ hour in length.\n\nWe expect to leave here for the Dardanelles in four days and are training at night & doing all sorts of difficult work. A great number of chaps suffering from sunburn, legs blistering and arms ditto. So long turning in for a few hours. A mail would not be bad for a change. Had Lime juice issued this morning.\n","61":"\nTobacco issued today first time, not bad but its too light. All the boys are suffering from sunbrunt legs and some are very sore looking. Had a nights work last night, bridge work, both trestle and pontoon. No 3 Company did a small piece of work, and we didn't do top bad. Visited Ghurka Camp.\n","62":"\nWrote Elsie today, just a brief note, am having a very hard time at present owing to all haste being used to cooperate with the 11th Division in about two or more days everyone is eager to have a kick at them. Turning out again tonight for some more brilliant training.\n\n\n","63":"\nLashed all the pontoons . I sincerely hope it is the case, although we are not well trained. All there expecting praise although a wee bit tired by the strenuous training the last three days. Had a fine day bright with a young Englishman who we met whilst going to the Greekstore. One thing that strikes you forcibly with the keepers of these stores is the dependence & also incivility of the salesman, also the ridiculour rates of charges on their goods.\n","64":"\nHard luck but we expect to leave tonight since we have been issued with ammunition and Iron rations also two days spare rations. Doug had news of his brother today, he landed on the Peninsular yesterday. Anniversary of the declaration of war last night at midnight. We did not leave today but it is nearly certain we shall leave first thing tomorrow.\n","65":"\nWe had some vey solid work transporting gear from the shore to the ships. We leave Imbros with 15 destroyers loaded & towing barges full of troops. Every available ship is carring troops, and altogether it seems unreal. Away in the distance an artillery duel is being fought with great dash. Well Good night Elsie and we shall be in it tomorrow. Left at 3.00.\n","66":"\nAnafartaSagar & Suvla Bay.\nArrived at Anafarta Sagar at daybreak this morning amid a heavy bombardment from cruisers off the shore. Lala Baba, a large hill rising from the cliff side was taken last night. We have so far not landed, notwithstanding the fact, we have been subjected to fire from the shore batteries. When we arrrived we steamed well up the bay to the anchorage close inshore. After anchoring a cruiser, \"Don's\" or \"Talbot\" was engaging the guns ashore. We could see our chaps landing on a long spit of land and the forts were shelling them with shrapnel, which we could see bursting all around them. Three lighters which were landing troops were nearly hit on several occassions.However the cruisers excellent shooting which was a beautiful sight soon put the particular batteries out of action.On our left, three guns mounted on the hillside began to shell us and three channel steamers packed with troops. The shots were falling very close and after one had passed screaming over our masts, eventually landing astern, we shifted our anchorage to a safer distance.\n\nAt the same time a Taube aeroplane dropped two bombs, one narrowly missing the \"Minnealopis\" which was packed with troops & artillery.The \"Chatam\" fired a few shots at her but could not get anywhere near her. She paid a few more visits later on in the day, much to our glee however they did no damage whatever.\n\nI think that we have been given a glorious view of all the proceedings and on the other page I will try to make a rough sketch of the country where this action took place. While we were disinterested for a few moments we were suddenly reinterested again by the exploding of two mines (land) and one had been exploded with a company of men on it, seen through the glasses their bodies were hurled in the air among the debris.At intervals cutters & ships boats come off from the shore filled with wounded men, one has just passed.\n\nThe bombardment now is really a game of \"Cat & mice\" as at three different positions three warships are waiting like huge cats and and soon as the hidden guns open fire shells simply fall on all sides around them until they are put out of action. A party of twenty men have left the ship to land and build a barrel pier. Billy left with them, also Red Manning with Shepherd in charge. It seems very hard to be so near yet veritably so far from the actual fighting and we have been lying at anchor all day here so lets hope we shift tomorrow either in it or out of it, for I and others are tired of being fooled about, like so many boys.\n","67":"\nThis is a sketch made roughly of the positions of the English & Turkish forces, on the 20thafter 13 days fighting, although the village Annafarta Sagir had been taken and retaken three times by the English but the youthfulness of the Terriers cannot prevail against the hardihood of the Turk, this accounting for so many advances and retreats or rather retires. The beach marked Kangaroo, is our beach and the ring is where we are camped. All the piers are of our construction, and have all been shelled, not suffering much damage only occasional shrapnel holes but the one on \"B\" beach was holed today, the triangular spot is a monument to \"Alla\", this not being destroyed by the bombarding warships, because of the value as a range finder. The four guns marked DG are Turkish disappearing and cannot be put out of action. They shell regularly every day, causing much annoyance to our troops. The batteries marked X are 60 lb on the NS and on the SW side are 18 Lbs, the four marked H are four is 4.5 Howitzers of the latest type.\n\nEnglish Battery\nHospital\nPiers (built by us)\nNavy Vessels\nMerchantmen\nTurkish Disappearing Guns\nEnglish in Possession\nTurkish in Possession\n\nScale 1,000 yds to½\"\nAnnafarta Sagir in a rough sketch","68":"\nby C.H. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8th Aug\nLanded this afternoon at 12.30 and established a small bridge by 8 o'clock. Heavy firing all night & the Turks have reinforced themselves. We drove them back 5 miles but it is costing a great deal to hold the position. The Munsters came in this evening for water and they were like a number of horses dashing a trough. Worked till midnight, pretty solidly.\n\n9th Aug\nVery quite day today, visited the evacuated Turkish trenches, saw any amount of wounded English and numerous dead chaps. \"Munsters\" came in tonight, 3rd Battalion went out. Very nearly sniped, 5 hands hopped off to the trenches, for a days sport, so far only 4 men returned. Heavy bombardment all day. Achi Baba reported to have been taken by the Australian & Gurkhas. Position has altered a great deal, & the Turks have been reinforced by such an extent that they are driving our chaps back, causing a great deal of nuisance to our chaps.\n","69":"\nHave had a change from the usual pattern of things having been employed generally with all styles of helping the wounded. We have worked pretty hard and seen some pretty bad sights, also plenty of pluck. Have been grave dugging, cross making, attending and altogether generally helping the poor unfortunate wounded, which have not been killed or bayoneted by the Turks. The noise of heavy bombarding by the warships is deafening and certainly does get on ones nerves, here sights are bad for a young chap like Doug to see, and I am rather not keen on his seeing them, but the good little \"Bunty\" stood it well.\n","70":"\nStill at the R.F.M.C's quarters & have been kept pretty busy throughout the day. There have been some very clever sniper disguises some having their rifles painted green, others with leaves painted over or rather sewn on their uniforms. One chap a sniper was buried up to his shoulders in the earth. They also employ women to snipe, several having been captured. Several Padres here, all kept busy administering to the wounded their different wants and conducting burial services. They are our direct neighbours in our dug out homes. A great number of troops landed last night and have reinforced the occupants of the present firing line trenches. The Turkish artillery have been firing on the Red Cross, but it has been due to bad management on the part of our side.\n","71":"\nHad a pretty lively day today being shelled heavily all the time whilst working. Have scribbled to Elsie, dear girl, I hope she gets the letters I send to her, I am sure she will be pleased Bunty has been moved today back to the camp.\n","72":"\nSo far work today has been impossible, owing to heavy shelling of the Turks and some came exceedingly close, one bursting on top of our dugout, smothering our breakfast with with dirt & sand. After it had exploded we picked up the empty cases & I picked up the \nempty\n head, which I am going to keep as a memento of an Australian's luck. We have been transferred to the original camp much to our pleasure to be with Bunty again. Posted Elsie's letter on the \"Havelock\" one of the latest monitors having rowed out to her, and stayed for supper. We heard that there were three bags of mail at Imbros for us. I hope it is the case. A big attack has been planned for tonight which if successful will make a wonderful difference on our account. The old pier was peppered with shrapnel lead and some of the pontoons hit. The warships were also shelled with 8\" guns.\n","73":"\nHave had a rotten day owing to dysentry and fever. The Turks blew up an Ambulance Station this morning also shelled headquarters heavily, 3 officers being killed & several wounded. A breeze having sprung up this afternoon caused a great deal of trouble to us, our bridges and piers bobbing up & down like a cork in rough water. I just wish I could get a hair cut & shave, having not shaved for three weeks, and not had a freshwater wash for three weeks. One blanket & gear still remain at Imbros and we still remain cold at night. We have made a decent dug out in which Les, Dave, & I doss. Bunty & Mac live in another next door. The area of our camping ground is Wallaby Park, & the beach, Kangaroo beach.\n","74":"\nStill suffering from my complaint of yesterday, only just a little worse in the former, and a little better, in the latter.\n\nAnother big attack last night, very successful, a big attack judging by the reinforcements has been planned for tonight. Am lying in my dug out with Les by my side and we are relating recollections & reminiscences which are very amusing. I do wish the authorities would send our mail over to us, for we deserve one, and as Les has just been here with three letters that he received today well we naturally are curious.\n","75":"\nReceived our first mail today, a very pleasing one for Doug, but, pleasing to a certain extent only to me. Elsie, dear girl, has evidently written three or four letters previous to this one, but they have gone astray somehow. I received letters from Mrs Adam and Jean, also Harry, and I am worried about mother dear soul, she must be worried about me too.\n\nWe have been constantly shelled throughout the day, and this operation is getting monotonous, same old shells, same old explosives, some are getting close, one has just dropped ten yards away, we have not estimated the damage yet, will report tomorrow.\n","76":"\nHad a very exciting day today, aeroplanes Taube & , monopolisingthe air for hours, a great sight, no material damage done, so far as I could see. Wrote a long letter to-day to Elsie, 6 pages as small as this, also one to Mother, these I presume will be posted today. Have had a bad cramp in the stomach so had Bunty. Goodnight.\n","77":"\nHave had another shell day to-day, all sorts & sizes, 2 chaps killed and 10 injured by the bursting of them. Everyone seems to be getting callous, here one chap, intent on burying some killed chaps, came around with a pick axe on his shoulder and asked, \"where'sthe bloke that wants burying\". Plenty of work about here. Had an amusing time whilst cooking rice for my first time.\n","78":"\nAnniversary of our going away to New Guinea, we left 12 mths to-day, on H.M.A.S. \"Berrima\". Heavy shelling all today, three chaps wounded. Have had a busy time carring sand bags and sand barriers. Dropped to Mother a short letter.\n","79":"\nAll the remainder of our Unit which were left at Imbros, arrived today and brought with them all our blankets & Great Coats, by jove, we will be glad to have a warm sleep again, for so far our coverlet has been the stars, and silvery moon, no blanket or waterproof sheet. As you can imagine we were cold. Our bridge on The Oz beach was holed by a shrapnel today and five chaps, English, were \"pipped\" by the explosion, tough luck. Still we have been barrowtrundling throughout the day. \"Granny\" has picked a party of O'sland to go out sniping with him all favoritism on his part.\n","80":"\nHeavy bombardment by all ships & land batteries, a very fine sight. A very heavy attack was forced last night, and proved very successful, our side gaining a¼ of a mile of trenches. So far no news of sniping party has come through but no news is good news, so we don't worry in the least. Pretty solid work today, three lighters to be unloaded so that means a busy time for us tonight.Made four pockets to-day, and gave one to Bunty, Mc, & Les. Had a very interesting confab to an English chap today um! very interesting indeed.\n\n\n\n\n","81":"\nThe heavy bombardment yesterday set a great deal of the enemy's country on fire thereby adding our side in a great extent. We gained hill 70, Chocolate hill being retaken also. Butcher was injured today having both his arms and his elbow badly gashed, the former being broken at the latter joint. Thereby the Bridging Train has sustained its first casualty. Re the 35 men despatched a few days ago, no news has arrived of their whereabouts. King had a fight with Corporal Smith, defeating him. Sent two P. Cards, views of Pt. Said, one to Mrs Adam and Denny, only very brief cards. Well, so long my friends, the Turks are shelling us again and there are some lively ones kicking about, so I must dodge. A week today, my birthday.\n","82":"\nErected an Officers Mess and built a new dugout, for ourselves. Same old shells screaming over our nuts, and same old \"Jonty\"crying out, like a court crier. Not feeling too good today, dysentry, again.\n","83":"\nA very heavy thunderstorm is brewing and I am writing this in case I will not have the chance later on. The aspect is very weird, heavy thunder, flashes of lightning, and the boom of our guns, also those of \"AsiaticAnnie\" and \"Little Jim\" put a finishing touch to the general aspect of the Lord's anger.\n\nWell I suppose a wet bed to-night for a change from our recent dusty ones. Goodnight my Elsie, I am going to write you tomorrow, also Mother dear.\n","84":"\nHad a very nice surprise in the shape of a consignment of fresh meat and bread, very kindly sent along from Anzac. Mac has been pretty bad again with some trouble. Cooked some rissoles for the boys, and had a generally lazy day. General position unchanged, Turks \"Asiatic Annie\" still in activity, one shell exploding on the \"Vengenance\" . We have had a rather good tea so of course still feeling pleased.\n","85":"\nReceived three letters today dated 27th, 26th & 28thJune respectively from Elsie, Jean & Mother, all were very cheerful and I feel wonderfully happy. We are working in watches, and I have to work all night, tonight so of course I am resting all day! We are now about to unload a lighter termed the \"beetle\" just come alongside. \"Asiatic Annie\" still in action and whilst reading Elsie's letter she dropped a shell close & handy. Well so long I am off to work, work, work. I believe we are so to be building piers and when that is done, presto! we move off.\n","86":"\nWrote to Mother, Jean, Miss Gelding, Sammy, Cecil, Uncle, a p.c. view of Port Said and of course have been fairly busy. Have had a fair sleep, for we did not finish work until 4 a.m. During the night rain fell very heavily and in consequence all hands were wet after their labors. The winter is approaching rapidly and the water was icy cold after tea time today. The general position has changed a bit for our benefit, the warships now concentrating their fire on a new 75lb gun of the Turks on the other side of the ridge. Suffering badly from a painful stomach trouble.\n","87":"\nOur watch worked all the morning and am now standing off until midnight, whence our work again begins. Position in affairs still in our favor for battery (Howitzer) now occupying Chocolate Hill. Water is extremely cold and a general climate change is expected. Our Reinforcements arrived yesterday & now include 9 men from Victoria. No mails at all.\n","88":"\nMy birthday, and as a celebration I visited the trenches, with Yank & Les. Poor old Les, whilst sniping snipers from a trench, we were sniped or rather Les was hit, the wound though, of course unlucky, were in the sense of the term lucky, the bullet penetrating the 5 fingers of the right hand, the little finger was the only one that was broken in the least and that a small piece of bone . The wounds extended to his head, making a rip from the eye to the tip of the ear. He is the last thing in nerve. Gee whiz, he can stand some pain, for after I had slipped an emergency bandage on the wounds, he walked with us from the the trenches to the Camp, about 5 miles, and had his wounds further dressed by Butcher Morris. We saw him safely ensconced aboard a Hospital ship and he is going to Imbrosfor a spell. Well Mac left us today, and we are three. It never rains but it pours. Doug had word his brother had been posted missing. Poor kiddie, he is naturally very upset but is standing it well.\n","89":"\nWrote to Miss Fuller sympathising with her and explaining his wounds. Had a fairly busy day, what with Turks shells and dugouts well we had to top Doug up poor kid is standing it well and of course is feeling a wee bit sick but wont mention it for worlds. Nothing doing just holding trenches and waiting for a burst, that will come soon.\n","90":"\nWe have suffered today through a heavy bombardment and we also had three casualty, one chap Atkinson had his leg hit by a 12 pnd shell and had it afterwards amputated at the knee; after the operation he said leave that to the sharks - Newray & Doug were also hit, not very badly. General conditions a little further advanced on C hill and still holding our own on hill W.\n","91":"\nHad a very quiet day and having worked from 12 midnight to 5 this morning, stood off all day. Played cards & smoked cigarettes all day, beginning work at 5.30 p.m. again! Now and then an occasional shot & the pomp pomping of the machine guns.\n\n\n\n\n","92":"\nThe Turks attacked last night and surprised our side & very heavy bombardment from them, but fortunately not very much damage was done. The batteries replied, also the Eurayalas and eventually silenced them. Whilst bombarding and attacking all on line was brilliantly illuminated by the bursting of the Turkish shells. The Turks casualtes mounted to 1500 our side 18 men. The guns from batteries and warships gave the Turks, some headaches, the carnage being awful.\n","93":"\nPaid£2-0-0 today and we of course are feeling very large. The Turks with their heavy guns gave us a very lively time and a Taube dropped 2 visiting cards, not doing much damage. Wrote to Elsie. We (our unit) seems to be enjoying itself. Here is the list of places where our other gear is at present. Our horses, India, waggons - Alexandria, Harness - Malta, Kits - Imbros and travelling kitchen at Plymouth, so this is very cheerful.\n","94":"\nHad a very quiet day, save for a heavy gale which of course upset everything in general including the Pontoons. Had a little pastime, in shooting the breakers. Issued with more cigarettes. Some very large shells came our way this morning believed to be from the forts of Maidos.\n","95":"\nStill a gale so of course our piers have not been erected again. Had a quiet day and have just come back from the \"C\" Beach; having had a fairly exciting time with the Surf. Euryalas has been shelling & (rumored Maidos), and the \"Swiftsure\" has had her 7.5\" going. The Turks have been shelling us constantly and I had a pretty narrow squeak from a shrapnel burst. Charlie Schank was killed today & four others were wounded. The General position remains unchanged facially but things are expected to happen in a very short time.\n","96":"\nWitnessed an awful sight, Cpl Perkins was lying in his dugout when high explosive shells landed in it, blowing his head & arms right off, a piece of his skull struck my check. Harry Lomey was wounded in the foot or knee.\n\nMail arrived after having been to London and I received Elsie's 1st letter, a long cheerfully written one.\n\nBuried Perkins at 8 o'clock, and received a fairly heavy shelling all night. Generally unchanged. The positions are still the same.\n","97":"\nHad a rotten day, lively enough but still not too bad. No casualties but close shaves. A big attack for tomorrow. Wrote Mac and received a parcel from him. Wrote Elsie.\n","98":"\nHad a rather quiet day, only a few shells and a Taube. Had a lively time last night, issued with Rumand worked till 12. Rumored that Sir Ian -- is going to Constant to arrange terms of peace with Turks.\n","99":"\nRumored a big attack going to be made on Sunday, also rumored was bag of mail left for Imbros. A few shells made their presence felt this morning, no one was hurt, had a out from the buoy, worked 12 to 5. Generally the position unchanged, weather humid.\n","100":"\nReceived a present from Elsie, pair of socks, which are very acceptable especially as they werefor my birthday. Turks made a weak attack on Left Flank, but very unsuccessful. Received letter from Len Watson, Elsie (2) & Mrs Adam also Mae.\n","101":"\nHad a lively day, made some scones inclined to be on the \"Sudden Death\" side, but were all eaten up, will make an oven tomorrow if I can procure an oil drum. Wrote Uncle Nev & Elsie a fairly long letter. The Pioneers say that our artillery is on the move tonight, they have made a Gun Rd. I suppose the attack will be on the move soon. Anniversary of attack in New Guinea.\n","102":"\n\nTurks opened a new battery of 4 guns, q.f. and my word they gave it to us hot & strong, all over the place, but they did very little or no damage so they are not to be feared. Today is the 16thSunday since we left Melbourne. Sunday has you writing today Elsie. I suppose you are.\n","103":"\nAnniversary of procolamtion of taking of New Guinea. The usual arrival of shells. Had news today that Phil Lecuar had died of Appendicitus. Hard luck. Bunty had a run to Imbros today, and he has not returned yet, expect him tomorrow.\n","104":"\nNot a shell over today, so evidently the Leary bombardment last night has made a difference. The warships have been bombarding for 36 hours both Chanak and Maidos, suffering. Nothing further here, no attack lately, position generally quiet.\n","105":"\nNothing much today, same old routine, mingled with no change. Had an attack of Malaria very slight though and was soon cured. The clemency of the weather has been rapidly changing and we have been shown, owing to the rain our dugout's failings. Made an oven with Rusty yesterday.\n","106":"\nA few shots over today not very much work done, the huge dugout is still in progress and the men are beginning to get a trifle disgusted, and no wonder.\n","107":"\nSame old Shrapnel today, some quite handy and we are now aware of the presence of a new Turkish battery which can infliade our camp with ease.\n","108":"\nToday has been a record as far as shelling is concerned, we had 48 shrapnel over in 8 minutes, without counting the high explosives. The 'Talbot', 'Swiftsure' & Don's arrived today. Had a letter from Elsie, dated 9th Aug. Am writing 17th week tomorrow.\n","109":"\nIt has been a raw bleak day and nothing but dust and dirt have prevailed over our discomforted feelings. Same old procedure re shelling. Gee, I do feel rotten anyhow, it's no good throwing in towel yet, but I'll have to get something to ease up this scourging complaint.\n","110":"\nTaken pretty bad last night and now in hospital, feeling rotten. Plenty of shells.\n","111":"\nStill in Sick Bay, feeling rotten, shells hundreds of them. Thousands of troops landing.\n","112":"\nStill a patient. Oh! it's rotten when you're sick, shells plenty, troops hundreds. Narrow squeaks everyday.\n","113":"\nSame place still a bit better, this place is a cold rotten dreary hole attended by a quarreling tribe of ragtime attendants.\n","114":"\nReceived a letter from Elsie, Capt L & Mother. All very decent, feeling a bit better now out of hospital. A very large shell landed today amongst some barrows.\n","115":"\nQuite today, just a few shells nothing happened of any importance, no further movement, position just the same as three weeks ago! Soon to have a big attack, about 20,000 landed recently.\n","116":"\nWrote 17th weekly scribble to Elsie, feeling rotten and had to go into sick Bay again today. Gee, my stomach is bad, vomiting wholesale. Things are generally quiet.\n","117":"\nA general attack along the whole of the right flank and centre of the line, have not heard of how it turnedout. The sight was a magnificent one, the Vereys lights, Star Shells and Shrapnel, etc, combined with the intermittent flashing of the Turks batteries was a sight worth seeing.\n","118":"\nIt appears the whole of last nights fighting was caused by a chap playing on the bagpipes. This action caused the Turks to open fire on our trenches and of course we opened fire on them. Well no too good. Goodnight.\n","119":"\nStill having the same old quarry work having a rather rotten time.\n","120":"\nNothing of any importance, rumors of a big attack soon. Turks rumored to have 3, 15\" Howitzers up, if so look out tomorrow.\n","121":"\nJust a few stray shells, and having a slight better time.\n","122":"\n4 Killed next door to us, next camp, and 8 wounded after a heavy shrapnel fire. Attack getting very near now.\n","123":"\nShells from \"Asiatic Annie\" all day long. Taube came over about 6 p.m. Having a great time, although very sick.\n","124":"\nStill Shrapnel & Lyddite among the horses and and Mule carts, plenty of damage among the Mules. Boydy pretty sick. Had an attack of Malaria.\n","125":"\n4 Shells landed in the Camp, all in the same place. Barber very nearly shot, while getting a shell up, Boydy taken to Hospital Ship. Had a rotten attack of Aigue and was put in Hospital.\n","126":"\nStill in Sick Bay, feeling A.I. expect to be out tonight. Two big shells landed in the camp, one just missing the pier, and another falling outside the Sick Bay door. Wrote to Coleman, a fairly long letter. Discharged from Sick Bay.\n","127":"\nShelling still continues, and rumors are flying about. Russia is supposed to have declared war on Bulgaria, and Greece is rumored to backed down on her original declaration.\n","128":"\nShells, in lively succession was the form of bombardment old Turkey lollie treated us to this morning. A very heavy gale and thunderstorm broke on us this afternoon, \"Evangelista's\" lifeboat wrecked. Trust Mac & Bell, aboard. White had very hard luck in getting a hook through his finger.\n","129":"\nCatchpole's love for gin caused great amusement. Plenty of work, plenty shells and any amount of fun. Feeling a wee bit better since my fever, and am picking up.\n","130":"\nMet a fine chap from the Devon Yeomanry and was working at little West Beach erecting some cribs. Not a shell today and it is Sunday. A very small mail arrived today, no luck.\n","131":"\nSpent a very decent day at West Beach hauling wood and doing general work. Some very big chaps from the Scottish Light Horse. Soccer made a new soup. Shadow was not in it. Received one letter from another small mail. West Beach is a hive of operation, some very recent stores for the new canteen.\n\n\n","132":"\nA big mail arrived today, but I only received one letter out of it, and that one was a letter from my dear. Heavy shelling today. Hamilton had left hand smashed by Shrapnel. No change in the general podition.\n","133":"\nAnother big mail, no luck for me, not one letter. I am feeling dissappointed. Wrote Elsie, heavy bombardment all day, Johnny not much damage done.\n","134":"\nNothing more than the customary shelling, and the usual small amount of slight damage.\n","135":"\nTook French leave and went to Anzac, with Robbie and Parkie, saw Hann and Curlys cousin, Curly, I heard, had been up before Medical Board for examination of heart. Andy had left the week before with dysentry. Drummond \nhad\n was at the Apex. Visited Pope's Cnr, Quinn Post, Courtneys Post, Walkers Ridge, Shrapnel Gully, the Apex and other sundry places. Whilst over there a Taube flew over and very nearly brought down. Returned after a long & tiring walk. Snowy gave me a pair of Glasses very decent indeed.\n\n\n","136":"\nThe Taube of yesterday certainly got some good information, and the result was the heavy shelling of the batteries. Gus visited us today and told us that there were only 3 killed and seven wounded.\n","137":"Oct\nAn aeroplane was forced to alight on the salt lake yesterday. I hear engine trouble was the cause. The Turks expended 100 odd rounds of Shrapnel, etc, but failed to hurt the engines, the wings suffered the bigger portion of the damage.\n","138":"\nHooray, received 5 letters and of course was overjoyed. Nothing of note so cannot report. Shells in plenty.\n","139":"\nTook a run to the trenches, and was not very pleased. Not much shooting, using loopholes now. Things very quiet. Shells in galore.\n","140":"\nWorking a West beach all day. Saw Brandon & Petit. Nothing unusual, same old humdrum style, plenty of large shells for a change.\n","141":"\nTaube paid us another visit, and made a present of 3, 90lb bombs, no damage done. Heavily shelled thoroughout the day, not much damage done. Pier was damaged.\n","142":"\nHeavy shelling this morning but otherwise everything just the same. Warships bombarded all night. Raining very heavily and sleet plentiful, cold my word. Wrote Elsie a 16 page & added 2 curios.\n","143":"\nGot a treat of shells & shrapnel, otherwise everything was alright. Started to build new Mess & Dug out, worked pretty hard all day. Bunty crushed his foot.\n","144":"\nUusual shelling, but never mind, I suppose they will. Getting on finely with the new mess etc.\n","145":"\nAustralians gained 400 yds last night, and the Turks replied bothsides losing heavily. Dugout will be finished in another days time.\n","146":"\nReinforcements arrived etc.\n","147":"\nShelling again throughout the day, working pretty hard all day, finished it by midday. Will cut his hand verybadly, while making a reflector for his lamp.\n","148":"\nTrusty cut off his beard an awful looking thing too. Had afternoon tea with Brandon & Petit also Gale & Mc. Finished my new mess and weare twelve. Now reign supreme. Had a letter from Les Fuller.\n","149":"\nSlight attack on Anzac. Willie took three non uninonists into his tub factory. Working at West Beach on \"bubs\" etc. Received a letter from Mr McGee. & Geo Bolus.\n","150":"\nReceived a fine present from a chum on the lighter, and it consists of Chicken, Calves Foot Jelly,Milk, Candles and Black Currant Jam.

Have not heard who one the Cup yet.\n","154":"\n\"Prince George\" hit in two places, one aft & one on water line, a transport Julian was set on fire by a shell, however not very much damage was done. Quinn, drunk, and told everyone off. A few shells, nothing much, made a report of West Beach.\n","155":"\nSth West gale still continues to blow. The \"Louis\" broke in halves, plenty of oil about, also ammunition.\n","156":"\nTurks shelled the \"Louis\" all day, no damage done. Messed with A.S.C. Officer tonight, stood of all the afternoon.\n","157":"\nWorked until 12.30 a.m. and am feeling very tired. Mail of 10 bags received, 3 from Elsie. \"Swiftsure\" bombarded and rumored to have blown up a armored train.\n","158":"\nChurch parade.

After Church Service, which was very interesting for a change, we had the day all to ourselves. Had a few shells over, nothing much damage though.\n","166":"\nHad a fairly busy morning and worked West Beach for 5 hours. Big Sth West gale blowing, and sea rising a treat. Bombardment of both sides still continues.\n\n\n","167":"\nTurks attacked Fishermans Hut with vigor. Saw K of K today inspecting and watching a demonstration of shrapnel firing on the Turkish lines. Turks counterattacked heavily, not much damage done.\n","168":"\nBrandon pretty unwell and having a bad time with some complaint. Turks attacked Hill 60, and were repulsed, we attacked and gained two lines of trenches. Big Sth E Gale blowing up. Bracy washed out.

Petit looking rotten. Bill Sones got up. Raised the trestle pier shore end.\n","170":"\nHad a more or less exciting day, the ships sighted a transport and blew it up, witnessed this with my glasses. Rotten sight too. Bill Sones arrived into the Mess again.\n","171":"\nRonaldo arrived back from Weymouth with my brothers message, also had a jawache.\n","172":"\nBlowing a very nasty cold breeze today and a very bitterly cold wind. Watty & Denham told off for a working party at Lala Baba & they are having an excellent time. Wrote Elsie.\n","173":"\nCold breeze still very persistent, and it surely does find the weak spots in ones clothing. Went to Lala Baba for a walk with Reg, and came back. I was reported wounded at West Beach.\n","174":"\nSunday moring, gee whiz, how the time does fly, and the wind had changed to the Sth West coming up in a fair gale. I have been in the skiff crew, stroke oar in sick.\n","175":"\nAfter the gale the wind swept round and is now blowing a bitterly breeze from the Black Sea, and is accompanied by snow. The wind has heightened to a gale, and the troops in the firing line are certainly having a bad time.\n","176":"\nFrozen, frost bitten, muddy, and with their clothing actually frozen on them, the troops fare being brought down in the ambulances as fast as they can possibly bring them.

However despite all orders, bugles etc, the boys stood stock still & refused in a body to Drill or fall in until we were paid some of our money due. \"Granny\" flew off in a rage & visited the \"Europa\", after seeing the Captain & the Base Commandant, he returned.

All the lads are looking better for the respite and look for all the world like a \"devil may care\" crowd of Strikers. Of course we all realise the punishment but the thought of it always banished by the jocular manners in which it is regarded. The inquiry still proceeds and the armed guard still patrols. Heavy gales and bitterly cold winds have prevailed the last three days.\n","229":"\nWent aboatd the \"Empress of Britian\" and our destination is Alexandria.

Viewed from the harbour, the city seems to be a huge square box, with four tall square buildings as corners. The wharfage accomodation is capable of taking a 45,000 ton ship. We disembarked at 8 pm and boarded a train or rather a cattle truck attached to an engine and set off at 10 pm for Ishmalia, the half way house of the Suez Canal.\n","233":"\nArrived Ishmalia at 6 am after a journey of Jars & Jolts.
