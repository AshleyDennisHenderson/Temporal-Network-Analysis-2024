The nature of the liquid is unknown at present. This is the first time on the peninsular that German tricks\n\nhave been tried.\n\nOur observing station got peppered with 4.7 shells. One over, another in front, one each side and a time burst on top cut the telephone wires. About 40 reinforcements arrived today","59":" inst.\n","60":"\n\nLecture given about gas as used by Germans in France, By all accounts the effect is cruel, one sniff and a man is ruined for life.,The lungs swell up to an enormous size and then burst. We are issued with woolen helmets saturated with a certain chemical. The helmet is put on over the head, and fastened around the neck, by collar of shirt a piece of transparent material is put in front to see through. The authorities believe that gas will be used. The Naval observation baloon is up at 6 A.M. They observe for the navy fire. It seems a regular thing for the Turks to fire at night now. Last night, about midnight, a number of high Explosives came over. The explosive now used is greater than formely used. Aeroplanes busy\n\nthis morning, Weather still warm and fine. Flies still plentiful New M.O. visited our wagon line yesterday, Nothing suited him, one of those men that quoted book all the time. I might say that our doctor Capt Howes and Corp Jones and another man went to hospital with fever All A.M.C. men. Fever is raging here. The fleet reserve men belonging to the R.N.D. have gone to Lemnos to be drafted onto boats. The French have landed some 55 Millimetre guns a little over 6in they fire on the top of Achi Baba. Today Tuesday is a feast day of the Turks An attack is likely to take place but so far there are no signs of it They still continue to shell the beach. They shell from two places. Achi Baba and the Asiatic shore, and without doubt 150 to 200 shells lop there every day. As I write this the shells are going over. The damage they do is comparatively small. The most serious damage of all was a shell through ordnance store. Great talk about the French 75 Field Artillery and the damage they do. The guns are good no doubt, but still, they kill a terrible lot of their men, and ours\n\nalso. Talking about the French I have no time for them, on this peninsula at any rate, They think they own it They take charge of all wells and water troughs and mount a guard over them. The officers are gentlemen, but the privates are pigs. And while on the subject I will say, that they are the most unsanitary people here, their camps are simply awful. I have known men particularly Artillery men to sleep with legging spurs on absolutely everything on, week after week, The treatment of horses, Artillery I am talking about, is without doubt an eye opener. Talk about cruelty to dumb animals, I have seen horses taken to water with hardly a leg to stand on, Bullet wounds (septic) in legs and body with pus running out, Another favourite habit is jagging the mouth of the horse I have seen their mouths bleeding, Horses in wagon lines packed close together kicking and biting one another, legs swollen, heels galled and horses sick, suffering from the affects of colic and catarrahal. They water twice per day, not because they can’t get water, but because their system is rotten, Their shoeing is done by contract. The Farriers supplies, shoes, nails, coal and tools. It takes\n\ntwo men to shoe one horse. Two men at one foot, One holds up the foot and the other works at it. They also eat any horse that is killed by the enemy. Their Army service is rather complete, also complicated. Each division has its own transport. Their vehicles are of all sizes and descriptions. The men that look after their animal the best are the Indians. Enemy’s aeroplane over 6 P.M.. Dropped 3 bombs, one of our planes already up made no attempt to molest him.\n","61":"\n\nTwice the enemies aeroplane was over this morning 5.15 and 5.30. Just scouting about observing & etc. Weather still fine Very quiet this morning, 10 reinforcements arrived, raw recruits. Left Sydney in May. Never saw a gun or wagon before. Sent to wagon line for me to do as I like with. It is creating a lot of discontent in the 1st B.A.C. and Batteries. I have already got a sample of April reinforcements. Takes them about an hour to harness a pair of horses\n","62":"\n\nTurned out last night at 9 o’clock to bring a new Battery from the base, D Battery. Their horses are at Alexandria\n\nfinished at 5.30 A.M. Their position is about half a mile in front of our Battery. A fairly warm place One of our old hands is back again after an absence of six months. He went to Malta sick.\n\nThe Battery we took into position last night is D Battery 66 Division 13 Brigade gave us a large amount of work going all night. The bigest lot of wasters I ever saw, they want spoon feeding Expected us to take wagons up to firing Battery in daylight, a thing we never do, all our work is done at night. One of their men was wounded the first night, shot through the arm, not serious. German aeroplane over this morning dropped one bomb. Our aeroplane was up about an \nd\n hour before. He the German, was up a terrible height, appeared he was looking for guns. A 15in Howitzer landed last night. Talk of a big bombardment tomorrow. The reinforcements are a poor lot of men only half trained.\n","63":"\n\nBattle ships sent a few in last night. The weather still continues fine, no sign of any rain. A number of new field Batteries are arriving. The Battery we took up on the 29th had some of their gun pits blown\n\naway, only been there a few hours. Two shells over this morning 5.30. The health of the troops here is very bad, for example the 5th Lincolns that come here were a smart \nlot\n body of men, today most of them get about half dead. Frenchman on horseback galloped through our lines, horse run away with him, A wonder he didn’t crack his neck Battle ship firing on the top of Achi Baba 80 or 90 shots a beautiful sight, a terrible upheavel The enemy was very quiet this day. This evening, a big attack on the left, lasted half an hour. 3 or 4 shots over this evening at 7.30 P.M. Tonight another Battery of Artillery lands. The Q.M.S. of B Battery was killed, hit by a shell. He was here only a few hours. A few prisoners captured this evening. A mob of Indian sheep or goats grazing on crest of hill, the Turks opened fire on them, put in 50 shots following them half a mile, as luck would have it they either fell behind or to the left, not one animal was toutched, Q.M.S. of Engineers killed rather rough on Q.M.Sgts. We recieved bad news last night at 9 o’clock to the effect that hill 60 was again retaken by the Germans, and that a division of men were\n\nkilled by poisonous gasses, which is I hope not true. We also heard that 25,000 Turks surrended at the Pursian Gulf with all guns, rifles, ammunition, and stores.\n","64":"\n\nHot this morning very hazey, one shot over, just sent 6 A.M. on to beach, Not often they send them down so early, it will upset things a little, as most of the rations are drawn about this time. Our doctor, Capt Howes, returned to duty yesterday. The enemy are sending the shells over on to the beach alright this morning fast and furious, Tonight 9 aeroplanes over 7.30 P.M. Been a very hot day, We now hear that hill 60 not been taken.\n","65":"\n\nA dust storm last night blew like fury. There is a lot of dust about, here. The Howe Battalion, R.N.D. held a bit of a consert last night, I think a thing like that could be left alone, considering the number of men in that particular battalion that have been killed. I consider it time enough to have the like of that after the war is over A large number of troops have been relieved from here. There was a fierce\n\nattack last evening and night. On receiving news of the great victory in the Pursian Gulf, an order came out to fire one round from every gun and rifle on the peninsula. The men in the trenches cheered when they got this order The Turks thought it was an attack and showed themselves so you see no ammunition was wasted.\n\nThe 6th Battery wagon line is still having a lively time, a few 4.7 in amongst them yesterday. One chap left his dugout and went into another, when he came back his dugout was a complete wreck, he was lucky. It is going to be a dirty day. I am writing this at 5.30 A.M. Sunday. I never in all my life saw so much sickness amongst troops as here. They get bad in their inside (dysentry) and then they get what the doctors call debility, and are then sent away to hospital The damage done at the base today is serious, the wireless station is blown to atoms 6 men killed and four wounded. There has been more shells over today than usual. Our Battery had a narrow escape this evening a German aeroplane over dropped 2 bombs. One failed to explode, the other\n\nattack\n burst near the cook house, which is on the right of the Battery, and luckly no one was injured. The disease amongst our horses is rather peculiar (Stumalitis) the Vet named it. It appears in little lumps along the jugaler vein, then breaks out in a pus formation which is very hard to check, in fact we cannot stop it. I had three horses suffering from it, at present I have only one which is not so bad, it is only about the mouth, and is almost well\n","66":"\n\nThe weather still fine, not so hot this morning, Our wheeler Rawlings sent to hospital last night at 10 o’clock, Fever. The Asiatic guns firing last night saw a number of troops coming over the hill.\n\nA few remarks about our daily routine may be interesting. Revallie 6.30 A.M. water feed and muck out, groom etc. Breakfast 7.30. After breakfast, fatigue draw rations, in the mean time 3 horses are sent up to the Battery, and orderly rides one and leads two, \nfo\none for our Q.M.I. and another for the Q.M.I. of D Bty \n\n66 division, to proceed to A.S.C. at beach to draw rations, They are issued to me at about 9 o’clock. The bread and jam is then issued to the men in wagon line, One man draws for four men. The water cart horses are then sent to the Battery, with two men. At 11.30 we water feed and etc again. Dinner is then served. The men are at liberty to go for a swim. 4.30 P.M. is evening stables this is when our work generally begins The water cart is again filled, ammunition is drawn, and taken to the Battery. Many a night we have been out till after midnight. The next duty consists of taking cartridge cases back to the ordnance depot. This is roughly our daily routine, with perhaps a little more added. The food we get here is not so bad. For breakfast we get bacon, bread and a mug of tea. Dinner is a very light feed tea, bread and jam. Bully beef if you care for it. For tea we usually have stew or fried, roast or boiled meat, with preserved potatoes and onions, and a pot of tea. We also get a ration of rice, and dried fruit, consisting of currants and rasins, sometimes prunes\n\nA rum issue of 2 fluid oz is issued 2 a week, Tobacco cigarettes and matches once per week. Lime juice is issued twice per week. The ration of bread is 2 men per loaf which weighs about a lb Biscuits are plentiful we can get as many as we like, as a matter of fact, anything in reason we want we can get, it is only a matter of indenting for it.\n\nA number of Battle Ships putting a lot of shells on or over Achi Baba this afternoon about 4.30. The French have taken over some country on the left, they were sending in some large shells this afternoon\n","67":"\n\nQuite morning, no shooting of any sort. A bit of an attack last night. 6.30 A.M. German aeroplane over our lines dropped one bomb about 700 yards from us almost got a man on horseback, missed him by inches, the only living thing with in yards. Talk of a great bombardment on the 4th of this month, the anniversary of the declaration of war. We believe the attack is going to take place from three points at once, and we are going to drive the Turks over the hill\n\nTo my knowledge we have three field Batteries, one Howitzer and one heavy Bty 60 lbs since the last bombardment A bit of a mix up about the reinforcement men that came here the other day, they are going to be sent back to Alexandria, and our own men substituted, no more than right, considering our men done all the rough work and sixteen weeks training in Egypt. It is a fact that men we have here at present only left Sydney in April of this year, and a beautiful lot of wasters they are. They never saw a gun, in fact one of them said to me, are you light horse. The first \nhorse\n shot over morning 8.25 although this is a serious job a few jokes work in occasionaly. For example, Two stretcher bearers of the Manchesters were carrying a dead man out of the trenches, when an officer met them, and said, what have you there, a sick man tip him off this is for wounded men only. They tried to explain, he would not listen to them, do as I tell you he roared, they did so saying, he is dead sir. The officer left the spot rather hurridly. \n\nThe Major visited the wagon line today\n\non his way to Artillery Head Quarters Our horses are in the best possible condition at present, I have only 38 all told. The work in our Battery is very little for our horses. The guns are still in the same position.\n\nA few high explosives shells in front of our lines this morning. Can see a white flag flying in the centre of Achi Baba, Can’t make out if it is a dressing station flag, Their first aid flag is a red cresent and star on a white ground, However things are very quiet The Naval baloon is up 4 P.M. 3 or 4 shots have been fired. An hours bombardment by warships 4.30 to 5.30 P.M.\n","68":"\n\n12 month since the beginning of the war, The Turks are bombarding our trenches, otherwise things are very quiet this morning. Still rumours of a bombardment. Some trouble with our 18 lbs fuzes, this is new ammunition 11.30 A.M. the well in front of our lines was shelled again about 50 shells put around it, 3 or 4 water carts each with 2 horses and 2 men were there no one injured\n","69":"\n\nGerman aeroplane over dropped two bombs one near the ammunition dumps, and the other at rear of our horse lines, no damage done. \n\nRather an extroardinary incident occurred in our lines last night between 9 and 10 P.M. One of the R.N.D. a man that often comes down to our lines, come down, and was talking away for a time, when he suddenly fell asleep, we tried all in our power to awaken him, Shook him, dashed water in his face, rubbed his face and hands and even lifted him up, They all failed entirely, We then carted him to the doctor, After half an hours work he awakened him. This morning the man appeared to be alright. 6.30 P.M. enemies aeroplane over dropped 2 bombs. That is twice he flew over our heads today. The Navy is tearing them into the hill this evening. Cholera we hear has broken out amongst the Turks. A new landing was affected between here and Gaba Tepe a day or so ago. Gaba Tepe is about 8 miles from here. Still rumours of a big day comming off. A few shells\n\ncoming over from the enemy\n","70":"\n\nDull cloudy morning rather cool, some heavy guns firing somewhere, warships I think. French practicing with machine guns, a new pattern they have got. Parade kit inspection today. Drew 356 rounds of ammunition 18 lb this morning. 356 rounds of 3 lb Naval. The Naval baloon just going up, Rumours of a bombardment at 2.30, this was written in the morning about eight o’clock. The bombardment did start at 2.25. The Navy set the ball going, 5 Monotors 2 Destroyers and 1 Russian warship bombarded all about Krietha Village. The time shrapnel is now playing on them it is 5 P.M. The rifle and machine gun fire is getting strong. Infantry advancing I presume. Later news, Captured 6 trenches (concrete) Our Battery firing all night 20 seconds interval, Drew today 580 rounds 18 lb ammunition\n\n7\/8\/1915\n\nGerman aeroplane over dropped one bomb and then made off. Artillery firing, Rifle fire very severe. One or two shells coming from the other side. Our lads\n\nat Gaba Tepe gained 3 trenches, and are now ½ a mile from the narrows. By all accounts the territorials turned dog and would not come out of their trenches and charge. It was fair hell up there yesterday, with 6in and 10in Naval guns playing on them. Lieut Selmes 2nd Battery Lieut Newmarch 3rd Battery, and Lieut Playfair of","71":" Battery all wounded. This is the second time for Playfair before he was wounded in the face, The same this time. I believe we suffered heavly 228 rounds of 18lb ammunition sent to Battery this morning\n\n152 rounds sent this evening at 2 o’clock. Stuck up for ammunition cant get it Continued bombardment at 8 A.M. mostly by French. At 2 P.M. a general bombardment by all troops here. Our operations at Anzac were successful 500 Turks captured. The 11th Division landed not much opposition. A terrible shake up in our wagon line 6 in shells bursting about our lines. Every minute I thought we would be wiped out One man belonging to Y Battery R.H.A. hit by a piece of H.E. shell. The piece of shell weighed about 2 lbs. it almost cut his thumb off. Another one of our\n\n \n\nmen seriously wounded. At 4 P.M. the bombardment livened up some what rather strong rifle fire. \n\n12 horses killed by a 6in shell at 17 B.A.C. A premature burst from a Monotor killed 3 horses on the beach. She was about 3 miles out. They are carting the wounded to the beach on lorries. It is a dirty windy day, hot and dusty I saw 2, 18 lbs guns going to the base both knocked out. Direct hits, One of our guns out of action for 3 hours, till I could get new part, Things are very busy\n","72":" \n\n63 prisoners captured yesterday. Turks attack at 8.30 last night. 251 rounds of ammunition drawn at 11 P.M. making in all 631, for the day. It is one of the worst jobs here, cant get it, got to wait till it comes from Lemnos, It comes over in destroyers. Dozens of wagons waiting for it. Took us 3 hours to get 251 rounds last night. The battery was again complimented upon its shooting. Official, 500 Turks captured and 9 machine guns, at Gaba Tepe. A British submarine sunk a Turkish warship carrying ammunition\n","73":"\n\nHeavy firing in the direction of Gaba Tepe. This side very quiet. Some terrible big shells over last night, some in front, and some behind our lines. Weather, dull and cloudy every indications of rain. Flies troublesome Asiatic side shelling beach this morning, killed 2 men and wounded 4 horses, very quiet just now, no shots of any sort. 1 P.M. Rifle fire all night. One wounded man Jackson returned to Battery yesterday from Malta. Another man of Battery wounded. One of H.Q. killed, and another wounded, still no ammunition available\n","74":"\n\nBattle ships firing all night down Gaba Tepe way. Nothing doing we are simply on the defensive, I think it is near the end. Thousands of Turks have lost their lives, it is wholesale slaughter here with a vengeance. 2,500 loaves of bread is baked here every day, by the A.S.C.\n\nA continuous bombardment at Gaba Tepe since 2 P.M. yesterday. We hear that the Turks are attacking in over\n\nwhelmning numbers, cant believe it The first official envelopes were issued yesterday\n","75":"\n\nA very fierce attack last night at 8.30 continued for about an hour. This morning a warship put 2 shots into Krithia Village. As I write another one went in. By all reports we have the Turks surrounded if so, it is only a matter of time, and they will have to give in. The two landings are linked up with us, so we extend a lot over 9 miles. A report that Maidos town is captured. The shots this morning were fired from a monotor 9.7 Howitzers.\n\nThe Attack last night was partly made by us and partly by the Turks. Very fierce while it lasted, a terrible cannonade. The Turks were repulsed. They are very stubborn fighters. 8.30 A.M. very quiet, also hot, flies troublesome. Went to look at a big gun the French are mounting behind our lines 9.2 or 120 pounders, they are more of a naval gun, mounted on circular rails, so as to be able to fire at any point. Absolutely the best gun pits I ever saw, about 10 feet deep. The French also have a number of 4.7\n\nguns in action around here. As I was there I went down to V beach This beach is solely for the use of French troops, although we landed there. The S.S. River Clyde was run ashore there and is still there About 150 Turkish prisoners are working on the beach for the French. Near to the beach is the grave of an officer practically the first to fall here. (A shell just come over and frightened hell out of me.) It is a common sight along the roads and in by ways, to see wooden crosses on mounds of earth, surrounded by stones denoting the last resting place of some poor unfortunate fellow; who gave his life for his country, and written in pencil on the crosses, in memory of “ “ who was killed by shrapnel, date so & so. One grave in particular a Major, (I have forgotten his name) of the 24th Battery, is the best that I have seen yet, a railing about 14in high, made out of hoop iron, and painted green and white, and the cross is made out of the dividing pieces of an ammunition box, it looks real well, and is beautifuly kept. There are a large number of French graves about here, they are\n\nlooked after well, One I saw a Lieut had a head stone, it was made out of cement, nearly all of them are catholics. The French had a bit of a bombardment today 4 Batteries fired 5,000 rounds in 2 ½ hours. The French battle ship, Prince Louie, was hit, a shell fell on her forward deck, not a great deal of damage done, when she was hit she sent in a broad side of six guns on Achi Baba. We captured the horse shoes trench. 400 of the Lanks went through the dressing station, and two companys are missing. This trench was occupied partly by the British, and partly by the Turks\n","76":"\n\nAbout a dozen squads of infantry drilling in front of our lines. One shell in amongst them, another over them. They are still at it, 8.30 A.M. A French General with an orderly, a Turco, the strangest turn out I ever saw, the cantle of the saddle like the back of an arm chair. The pommel high like a Mexican saddle, he wore loose white pants, with short leggins, a greenish jacket and a turban, he was wearing 2 medals. One of our guns reported\n\nout of action. 114 rounds of ammunition sent to Battery, Very quiet nothing doing. A complaint made about the state of our harness, particularly the steel work This complaint was lodged by our Captain\n","77":"\n\nA most fierce and determined attack made by the Turks last night at 7 o’clock. A terrific cannonade which lasted 2 hours, the rifle fire lasted all night. A hurried order down from the Battery for ammunition The Battery was firing 20 seconds, could only draw 76 rounds. Our Battery was the principal Bty supporting the attack of our troops. The Turkish Artillery are very much awake this morning, sending shells in 2 and 3 at a time, It is now 6 A.M. and indications of a hot day\n\n14\/8\/1915\n\nThe 6th Battery 4 guns and 4 wagons went to Gaba Tepe last night, carried 100 rounds of ammunition per gun, The remainder of Battery attached to 1st Brigade. Very quiet last night. The East Lanks are relieved, they were in Cairo when we were there. Ammunition still scarce. 60 men of diffrent units, with self inflicted wounds, mostly in hands and fingers, waiting to be court martialed. Six men of the East Lanks\n\nA.M.C. were wounded near our Battery, They were getting relieved, bad luck. Very heavy firing on the right rear Battle ships, some talk of a Naval bombardment\n","78":"\n\nA most terrific night, the Asiatic guns bombarding us something cruel. This happened about 9 o’clock, hundreds of time shrapnel coming over, Our guns opened fire on them, and then the Battle ships started, This morning the warships put in about 200 shots this was at 5 A.M. They were shooting over on the Asiatic coast 4 or 5 miles away, just now they have ceased firing. 12 men of the new Zealand Artillery arrived in our lines last night, Had to send a N.C.O. to meet them\n\nA battle ship firing 4.30 A.M. Turks returning fire with time shrapnel, no where near it. Regarding the shooting last night, as far as I can find out, only 2 men were wounded They were Naval Division men\n\n16\/8\/1915\n\nEarly this morning an attack on the French Zone, heavy cannonading, and rifle fire. At 6.30 P.M. 380 rounds of ammunition taken to Battery. One of 3rd Bty teams, fouled one\n\nof ours in a gate way, almost capsized our wagon and threw one of our gunners on to the roadway, He was not injured. The damage done was one hand spike broken and one horse cut on off hock, and near side rump. A report was sent in to the Battery. The R.N.D. going to the trenches for 9 days. The Turks are getting desperate, and are making numerous counter attacks. Had a ride along the beach last night, the amount of work done there would surprise you. It was possible to land in 2 places only, Now they have roads along the beach for miles and landings at 5 or 6 different places. Roads made everywhere, you must understand, that the cliffs are anything from 100 ft to 150 in height, so the job was no easy one. The Royal Edward a British troop ship was sunk near Lemnos Island last Friday, today is Monday. She had on board 2.000 troops between 500, and 600 only were saved. Heard today that Vance had gone to Gaba Tepe with three other Sgts. A number of details joined our Battery last evening, amongst them is a Sgt and a Corporal. Almost a riot in the Battery amongst the N.C.O. This is the second Sgt attached to us\n\n17\/8\/1915\n\n4 Sgts from 1st B.A.C. arrived last night Vance is amongst them. It was only in the evening that I heard he had left Alexandria.\n\nA few shells over this morning high explosives, pieces falling over our lines The days are getting shorter, and a little cooler in the mornings, flies not so troublesome. The first gifts of chocolate and biscuits, were distributed amongst us today. The Naval Division are going to make an attack tonight to straighten the firing line. The poor devils are always in it, today 9 killed and wounded. One man in","79":" battery wounded yesterday\n","80":"\n\nAn order recieved last night to get G.S. wagon, and six horses, to remove Naval 3 lbs from near firing line, got through alright, had it back by 1 A.M. The","81":" New Zealand Battery has gone to Anzac, and D Battery Kitcheners army takes its place. A few shots over from \nAchi Baba\n Asiatic side this morning 5.30\n","82":"\n\nA few drops of rain, seems to be clearing off, Shells from Achi Baba\n\n(which means Good Father) last night about 9 P.M. Very nasty ones burst close to our lines. A vast amount of sickness here again, Dysentry fever Debility, Rheumatism & etc. The R.N.D. in trenches 2 days getting relieved, 200 paraded sick yesterday. We hear a lot of rumours here. One of them is that Warsaw is taken by the Russians and 1,000,000 Germans taken prisoner and cut off\n","83":"\n\nFine and cool this morning. A number of shells over last night, 10 P.M. Some of the old sort, fall anywhere at any time. 400 reinforcements for R.N.D. arrived. A new Vet officer on the job, a real rotter, Capt Young 2 Brigade Capt Heslop going for a rest\n","84":"\n\nVery quiet morning General Paris with staff inspected the reinforcements of the R.N.D. He is head of the R.N.D. Still a lot of our men sick sending them away every day. Sgt Major Schmidt 3rd Battery going back to Australia invalided, his old wound has opened up again, bleeding internally\n","85":"\n\nNothing doing this morning, Sunday Still rumours of our moving, this is our sixteenth week here under fire I was inoculated against Cholera yesterday. The reinforcements belonging to the R.N.D. are dying already, most of them have been soldiering only 3 months One of them got drowned, and another contracted fever and died. 1,000 mules of the Indian Mule Corps, water at a well near our lines every evening. In the morning they start watering at 3 A.M.\n\nThe weather is still warm in the day time but cool at night, Very few mosquitoes here, in fact hardly any. Not 25 shots have been fired by our Battery this week, but a big stir up is in the wind. The C.O. was through our lines yesterday, he was down at Artillery head quarters. The French are occupying almost the whole of this peninsula. They are putting a Battery of 75, behind our Battery. Also another in our left rear. 4 aeroplanes over making for the Asiatic shore, surmised a French attack\n","86":"\n\nAnother mishap last night, 7.30 one man wounded, a shrapnel bullet entered\n\nhis hip and travelled up his back, carted him away to the R.N.D. dressing station, Never saw a man take it so bad. One horse killed, shot in chest entered the lungs. This horse was ridden by Bdr Fitzpatrick. Dr Simson was leading this horse back to camp when it fell into a ditch by the road side, after a lot of trouble we got her out, and upon examination found, that her near side hind cannon bone broken This is the outcome of exercising horses in bulk. Another 10 yards further along and 90% would have been wiped out. When this time shrapnel got in amongst us, every horse turned about and bolted back to wagon line. While I was attending to the wounded horse a number of shells landed on a bank over our heads 25 yards away. After we got the horse upon her legs, I never in all my experiences, heard a horse cry so piteously, She was staggering about when I shot her. We then had to fasten her behind a limber, under fire all the time and drag her about a mile to bury her. The man Jackson in the mean time was rendered first aid, and carried to the dressing station.\n\nThis morning he will be taken down to the beach, and sent to Lemnos Island hospital. The R.N.D. are moving over to a place named gully beach. Bad luck for me as I used to get a good deal of food stuff from the Q.M.S. The Naval Division, with the exception of men moving camp, are going to the trenches. A terrible windy and dusty day\n","87":"\n\nFine calm morning, very quiet, no shooting. The only thing moving, is, the usual number of mules going and coming from water, accompanied by their nigger drivers, with \nand\n an occasional string of english horses (R.H.A.) At last the 29th Division has gone away, but we still remain here, We were attached to them. A Battery of 60lb went away yesterday. Ten minutes past six the first shot over this morning fired by us. Three aeroplanes up this morning, going over Achi Baba. Reported that S.M. Sexton has got a commission. He is our Sgt Major\n","88":"\n\nAnother night out, bringing up 2 Batteries of English Field Artillery. 18 lb Kitchener\n\nArmy .C. Battery 56 Brigade. 10 Division. A small attack last night. Hill 50 captured by the Australians at Gaba Tepe. They are almost across the peninsula These Batteries are to relieve other Batteries that are here. At 5.30 this morning a few shots over from Turks. Two more divisions of French troops coming. A general move forward of most of the Artillery\n","89":"\n\nThe attack on the night of the 24th was not exactly an attack. The official news that Italy declared war on Turkey was read out, to the French in the trenches, with the result that they fired three rounds rapid. I suppose the Turks thought it was an attack. They were firing for about half an hour. Nothing of any importance happening this morning. Our Sgt Major has got a commission, About 5 in the Battery put in for it. He is still with the Battery, but we expect him to go to Alexandria any day. Things are quiet, we are simply acting on the defensive. Still a number of shells going over on the beach, coming from Asia. We are getting a new class of shell over, I believe they are 6in time shrapnel. They come\n\na long way, you cannot hear the guns. As a rule any shells that come over you can hear the report of the guns. Anyhow the burst are to high to do any damage Last night one burst over a lot of French troops and horses, no damage done at all. A few drops of rain last evening not much Thunder rolling about this evening, wind rather too high for rain\n","90":"\n\nThe weather is cool and cloudy, a few drops of rain last night, with indications of more today. Vance is doing three days in the trenches, with an officer observing artillery fire. Last evening a few high time shrapnel over no damage done. The R.N.D. were amongst them, As before stated they have moved camp. Some very nasty shells over at 7.30, about 200 yards in front of our lines, 8in time shrapnel expected them to increase their range, but as luck would have it, they switched away to our right, and got on to the French. The French Battery in front of our wagon line have moved forward it was the 46 Bty. We hear that the French is taking over this peninsula. It will be rough here in the winter, it is bad enough today\n","91":"\n\nAgain cool this morning. A quantity of stores arrived to sell to the men in wagon line. A little rifle fire last night, absolutely no Artillery shooting, no information obtainable. Recieved two letters from home yesterday, also one from Gr Fountain, one of our sick men, gone to England\n","92":"\n\nSunday. A lot of bomb throwing being practiced over in the infantry lines. Two prisoners to parade to the Battery this afternoon. Dr Josephson refusing to parade to M.O. when sick. The other Gr Martin, a waster from the 1st B.A.C. absent from his post on wagon guard. An Officer to sleep in wagon line. This is the first time in 5 weeks that an officer has been down here of a night.\n\nSome beautiful shot over last night time shrapnel. Two casualties in our wagon line yesterday, and strange to say both were kicks from horses. One a Frenchman kicked in stomach and shoulder, the other a Dr of R.H.A. kicked in stomach and elbow.\n","93":"\n\nA general stir up in wagon line\n\nregimental stable parade on the battle field, never heard of such a thing. A general muster parade at 9 A.M. then harness cleaning, and after that inoculation, second dose.\n\nA 6 inch shell landed 100 yards in front of Battery, bounced about 20 yards, and then burst, a most extraordinary thing. It was a high explosive, and strange to say no one wounded, and no damage done. A French aeroplane broke one of its skids on landing. The Turks put in about 50 shells, and the nearest went 200 yards off of it, of course it landed on the sky line. The Naval baloon is up, 6.P.M. a warship is blazing away, putting shots the other side of Krethia village\n","94":"\n\nVery quiet today, A few large time bursts. Visited the R.N.D. Q.M. Sgt, got 80 lbs of flour also a pair of slacks. A few shots over last evening. I am thinking that the new French division camped where the R.N.D. were, will get cut up in pieces\n","95":"\n\nAnother month gone and we are still at Gallipoli, Cape Helles. A dirty windy day. A harness inspection carried out yesterday\n\nwith fair results, a few sets dirty. The Navy is doing good work in and around our way. Preparations are being made here for winter quarters. A prisoner (Sloane) awarded 3 days C.B. Absent from early morning stables. We are expecting a big move in a day or two. We have been stock taking. 3rd Battery shoeing smith sick going away, My S.S. has been sick, he is in bad health, asking for a spell at Alexandria exchange with shoeing smith Elphick. The shells are coming over thick and heavy, high explosives 6 in very good bursts\n","96":"\n\nRather cool today, wind eased off a little. Rifle fire strong all night, artillery fire at frequent intervals. First shot over this morning 6.30. A list of all horses out of condition, to be taken and forwarded to Vet officer today. It is likely that they will be sent to Alexandria rest camp. Some high explosives shells over from the Asiatic side, a deadly gun gives you no warning, you hear a scream and a second after, a frightful explosion. I have seen with my own eyes pieces of these shells falling half a mile from where the shell burst. They say it is a Naval gun off the Goebin.\n\nA Sgt and Corporal gone to Anzac this morning, got a commission, Sgt O’Rielly is the Sgt. Lieut Selmes stopping at wagon line sick. Today is not so windy.\n","97":"\n\nA fair amount of Artillery fire last night, although rather quiet this morning. No rumours of any move yet. We are simply waiting, God knows what for. German aeroplane over, dropped one bomb and then made off, time 6 A.M. On our left flank rather a fierce attack. Some very big shells exploding, they are coming from the Navy, as we can hear the boats shooting\n","98":"\n\nFirst shot over this morning 6.15. Just missed our wagon line by 50 yards, one single shot. Great stir up in our camp a rumour about that our horses with the exception of 6 teams and 2 water cart, and one riding, to go to Alexandria. A nice fine morning, no wind or dust, not hot or cold, just right. The attack the other night was from the Turkish side, it appears we were sapping towards their trenches, and they were doing the same towards ours. They got in first and blew our sap up. 9 men of the Manchesters were wounded.\n","99":"\n\nSunday, the weather still keeping fine, flies not so troublesome, Preparations for a winter campaign. A large quantity of galvanised iron and timber landed here, to build winter quarters with. Our troops at Anzac gained 400 acres a day or so ago, they also captured hill 60. This hill commands a beautiful position, is cost us a thousand lives. A Turkish searchlight on the Asiatic coast in full view of French lines, working away for all she was worth. The French opened fire on it, made an awful mess of the shooting, could not hit it. As soon as the Turks saw the flash of the gun, they shifted the light about 100 yards further down. The distance across the water from where the French were firing is roughly about 3 ½ miles. It is the entrance to the Dardanelles\n","100":"\n\nA fierce attack by the Turks last night. 20 shots over in 15 minutes, 4.7. All over our lines. A number of R.N.D. men burried in their dugouts. They started at 11 P.M. and ended at 2 A.M. no damage done in our lines. These 4.7 were all time bursts, they were beautiful to watch. When they burst a yellowish light\n\nwould light up the camp. They come a long way, you can’t hear the report of the guns. The French were firing all night. 15 horses belonging to the 15th B.A.C. \/ R.H.A. were killed outright last night. A man belonging to the Drake Batt, hit with a fuze in the arm, almost tore his arm off. This was absolutely the worst night I have put in so far. The dust and stones were flying all over our lines. Early in the night a shell burst about 100 yards from our lines, the nose of it landed on the top of my dugout, it was a 5 ¾ inch. Today is again windy and dusty. I have just issued small calico bags filled with sulphur, to hang around our necks supposed to keep away vermin. The health of the troops is bad the worst desease is dysentry 90% of our men suffer from it, they send a lot away to Malta. I have seen some deplorable cases, men at the latrines all night long. Of course we have been inoculated against Cholera. Some of the doctors say that this dysentry is a mild attack of Cholera. At present the food is very good. Bread, fresh meat, onions, rice, rasins, currants\n\nand occasionaly we buy tinned fruit at 1\/- per tin\n","101":"\n\nNothing much doing this morning. The Turks are giving us a rest. A rumour going about that in five or six days we are off to Suvla Bay. This is the new and last landing place. The men on this peninsula are suffering untold agonies. The dysentry is very bad, in fact 60 men of our Brigade paraded sick suffering from its effects only yesterday. The Naval Division had 200 men sick with it a day or so ago. Practically every man in the Battery has had it in some form or other. I don’t think it is the water. I think it must be the flies. I have had a toutch of it this last 3 weeks, and I drink but very little water. The food we get now is good, bread fresh meat, prunes, rice. The sick men get milk diet. Corn flour and milk, sometimes arrowroot and milk, and often oatmeal, Bovril or extract of meat. Our Battery was inspected by Major General Hunter Weston yesterday. This is the job to find out what men are made of. We have in the 2nd Battery,some absolute wasters, men that are worth about 2\/- per week, real rotters\n\nTheir only worry is how to get out of fatigue work.\n\nThe 90th Battery 60lb has got only one gun in action, she is firing away now.\n\n8\/9\/15\n\nAnother night out last night. We had to furnish 4 four horse teams to move C Battery 56 Brigade into a new position We had to report at dusk. Then the work began. The new position turned out to be at a place known as Pink Farm, away on left flank, I recieved this information afterwards. A guide met our teams at the origanal position, and had instructions to lead us to the new position. He had already been there three times that day. We started off and after a while wondered where he was going to, We were sure he was on the wrong road, as he was making towards our wagon line, but naturally thought he had found a new road, Eventually we landed at 1st Battery wagon line. That was the end of that guide. Anyhow we found the Battery position, and went back to draw ammunition, got four loads again went to the Battery, and found them all asleep. We then went back to our own wagon lines. It was now 12.25 P.M. We again recieved orders to be at old position by day break with four wagons\n\nWe had to draw these wagons belonging to C. Battery, which were at","102":" Battery wagon line. We got there on time, and was told to wait till they loaded them with empty cartridge cases. We unhooked and cleared out, as rifle bullets were coming over rather thick. We went back to our wagon line. The time was 7.30 A.M. We again got orders to go up tonight and bring back wagons loaded with empty cartridge cases. This job could easily have been done in one night. Here are a few of my remarks. If this is the Imperial Artillery, then all I can say is God help them, they are worse than a lot of school children They cant even hook in a pair of wheelers And as I write this, still another order for a small arms limber, to proceed to W beach to draw canteen supplies for the 56 Brigade Head quarters. It is finished. You may hear of Batteries getting cut up, but you can take it from me that it is mostly their own fault. They have not enough sence to get in out of the wet\n","103":"\n\nA bit of a stunt last evening on our left, lasted ½ an hour. Only one or two shots over this morning, no damage done. We finished our job with C. Battery last night\n\nI believe we leave here in six or seven days, so the officers say, but that remains to be seen, for Anzac. The weather is getting cool, especially of a night and morning. The flies are still bad. Recieved a package of writing paper and envelopes from Vance also one paper from home. Today is again windy and dusty, a little rain would do good. The Asiatic coast a good shelling from the French heavy guns\n","104":"\n\nA terrific bombardment by battleships on the Asiatic coast last evening. French aerial torpedos used freely on the extreme right. As gun shooting from Asia to here. 6.30. Pieces of shells falling in our horse lines. It is a beautiful gun, all you can hear is a screech, bang, and then see a cloud of smoke and dust It frighten a lot I can assure you. At 6.P.M. The Battle ships shooting behind Krithia Village. Rifle fire very consistant last night.\n","105":"\n\nCool windy and dusty, otherwise quiet. Rifle fire severe last night. A bit of a bombardment on the right flank. A bit of a dispute yesterday, A N.C.O. and five men sent on fatigue work over to the 42nd Divisional Artillery Head Quarters. The Non Com got annoyed\n\nand wished to be paraded to the officer here, said he wanted to hand in his stripe. (Act Bdr Dawes). A little responsibility and that is the end of these sort of N.C.O. A driver also wishes to parade (Dorman) This parade takes place this morning at 9 oclock. Lieut Selmes is the officer. Another case on today a driver (Josephson) hitting a horse (Old Walter) over the head with a sapling. A rather serious offence.\n","106":"\n\nCool morning again, still windy. The Driver Josephson awarded 10 days C.B. for ill treating a horse, Old Walter the water cart horse. Sent £4 home yesterday through the field post office (registered). The enemy is very quiet this morning. My opinion is that the new landing at Suvla Bay, and further on is occupying the whole of their attention. We have this last day or so been making some attacks with no result no responce on the part of the enemy whatever, We have recieved orders to pack all of our vehicles. All gun pits dugouts and telephone wires to remain as they are. The wagon line may remain here. Vance is suffering from the dysentry. This disease is very prevalent, most of\n\nthe men have suffered from it\n","107":"\n\nA bombardment this morning, started at 5.30, lasted half an hour, no rifle fire at all, only machine gun fire. No information available. Great talk about our moving to Anzac. The Adjutant went past our lines at 10.30 A.M. on his way to Anzac. We had a lively half hour this morning. Shells falling everywhere, I think they are 15 lbs. A French G.S. wagon with water casks on it at well, One shot about 10 yards over, they thought it about time to move, just moved when another shell fell in exactly the same place where the horses were standing. I never saw such luck. Two more shots just cleared our horses. No damage done whatever. This happened at 7.15 A.M. Monday. We had Lieut Olding here with a sprained ankle. Had to take him to the Battery in a wagon. He hurt his ankle on the way down to the wagon line, fell down a trench The night was very dark\n","108":"\n\nTerrific bombardment last night by the French and Navy, on the right flank, and another this morning on the left, by the British Artillery. A French torpedo\n\nboat was hit yesterday, and slightly damaged. She had to be towed to dock\n","109":"\n\nA thunderstorm this morning rained like fury. Started to rain at 12 oclock. The French got in with a bit of a bombardment. Our Adjutant returned from Anzac yesterday. I suppose we will have to shift soon, as the 176th regiment of French infantry are making dugouts in our lines. They ask no questions, but simply mark out the place, and bring about 200 men and start to work. The rain has stopped 6.A.M. It turned out a fine day. We are having a new routine as regards parades, Orders are now that we must have an hours foot drill and half an hour signalling each morning. The Turks bombarded us something terrific this morning for about an hour. The old game was played again, 3 and 4 shells over at a time. I am almost certain that the French will take over this peninsula, they have landed some heavy guns 9.2 long range. The preparations they are making are extensive. Three New Zealanders, killed in action about three months ago, their bodys were only got and buried yesterday. A prayer book found on one had a note in it, saying, if anything\n\nshould happen to him to send it to an address in New Zealand. It seems a horrible thing for bodies to be left out all that time, but I can assure you it cannot be avoided. If a man only had to show his head above the parapet, it is certain death. Turkish aeroplane over 4.P.M. dropped 2 bombs then cleared out. Five of our planes up. Battle ship pouring shells into Achi Baba Surmised a 6 gun Battery is in action there. That is the Battery that was bombarding us this morning. My first taste of fresh fruit since Ive been on this peninsula. Lieut Olding is still in wagon line with sprained ankle, very bad.\n","110":"\n\nA beautiful morning, sun shining, no wind, with just a tinge of chrispness in the air. Every thing quiet no shooting. A most disgraceful thing happened at the Battery last night. Sgts Gurd, Bradwell, Hollis, Barlow, Corps Doughty, Bdr Thompson drunk and away from the Battery. Not only that but they insulted the officers. A crime like that on active service is punishable by death or 10 years penal servitude. A most disgusting state of affairs, considering that we are\n\nsupposed to back up the infantry in the trenches, and hundreds of lives depending upon our shooting. I say that these N.C.O.s should be punished to the utmost limit of the law.\n","111":"\n\nCold windy morning, three new men arrived last night. Old Battery drivers, they have to parade before the Major at 10 A.M. I suppose they will be sent back. They are Dr Bradley, Heyden, McLaughlan, Another man Dr Hellyer returned from hospital. The Imperial authorities are trying their utmost to keep us here at Cape Helles. It was rumoured that we go and join our brigade. We are now the 2nd Division or attached to it, the 1st is going for a six weeks spell to lemnos. The French captured a trench yesterday. Heavy Artillery fire last evening. Sgt Bradwell is working on a head stone in memory of Corporal Evans, who was killed in wagon line. He was shot through the lungs.\n","112":"\n\nGerman aeroplane over dropped one bomb. We opened fire on him , the first time since we landed on the peninsula\n\nFired about 50 shots. Some were dangerously close, others miles off. The detail as regards our moving is out. I was at the Battery yesterday. I am detailed to remain here with 20 men. Only 12 horses to go to Anzac, and they are 1st Battery. Later orders just recieved , postponed indefinately. A despute between the heads. The Division that we are attached to, don’t want us to go, but our General wants his division to be altogether, so things are at a standstill. Those three men that left Alexandria and come over here, were made prisoners at large, with defaulters drill and fatigues work. Two hours drill and three hours fatigue work each day, by orders of the C.O. The Prince Louie, French Battleship bombarding the Asiatic coast this evening. At 8.15 P.M. a bombardment all along the line. The French is firing away like fury.\n","113":"\n\nFine morning, very quiet after the bombardment last night. The 81st Regiment of French infantry, are coming in rear of our lines, building winter dugouts. Another man sent to hospital last night. From the 8th of last month till now, I have sent to hospital 10 men, that is from wagon line only\n","114":"\n\nCold disagreeable morning half a gale blowing. A Battle ship put a few shells on the top of Achi Baba last evening. The French are taking possession of this place gradually. It is over run with their transport. Some of the \nNotts\n most peculiar carts I ever saw. They appear to be carts for carrying wine barrels from the wine making districts. Also pagnal carts, Spring carts and drays. Their G.S. wagons would carry about 4 tons, terrible lumbersome affairs. Their harness covers almost the whole of the horse.\n","115":"\n\nBeautiful morning. A few shots over this morning. Battle ship shooting on Achi Baba last evening, same place as before. A bit of a bombardment on the right flank. The advance party of the 81st Reg. French is here, they come from Lemnos. They are building a bake house. Galvanised iron and stone\n","116":"\n\nFine morning no wind, sun shining. Still a few shots over, high explosives. The French are working at the back of our lines. Hundreds of them. I suppose they will get blown to pieces. They seem\n\nto invite it. If the Turks do open fire on them, we will get all we want. It is very noticeable that where ever the French are working, they draw fire and scores get killed.\n","117":"\n\nWe brought the Battery out of action last evening, brought them to wagon line, going away shortly. Vance, a Corporal, and myself, visited V beach, Seddul Bahr today. This is the French landing place. The amount of stores and building material would surprise you. Millions of pounds worth. Today is dirty and windy\n","118":"\n\nStill cold and windy. The battery is still in the wagon line, waiting for orders. One shot over this morning 6.30 Enemy very quiet. The winter is setting in fast. All hurry and confusion, expecting marching orders any moment. Never saw such a mess up\n","119":"\n\nTerrific bombardment by French and Navy on right flank last night. The enemy sent one shot over. A great amount of drink in Battery, one man put under close arrest this morning, unable to\n\nstand . At last we recieved orders to go to Anzac. No date known. Capt Heslop V.O. leaves for Alexandria today Capt Young, V.O. takes his place. The weather is cool. Guns still in wagon line, hung up properly. The 3rd Battery come out of action last night\n","120":"\n\nShells flying about, otherwise quiet, nothing doing in our Battery, still waiting for marching orders. Our new Sgt Major arrived last night. (Barron). A 6in Bty going to open fire on a Turkish Battery at 3 P.M. Our Major 3rd Battery and company are going to hill 200 to observe the fire Today is fine no wind.\n","121":"\n\nMy first visit to the firing line this afternoon. Some gastly sights up there, Dead men lying about everywhere, you dare not go out to bury them. One man in particular I noticed, belonging to some Scotch regiment lying dead, face downwards, full kit up even to his iron ration bag. In another part of the line, men lying in extended order about 50 of them, all dead. Midway between ours and the Turkish trenches. Whilst in the trenches, we (Lieut Selmes Sgt Major Barron and myself) heard\n\nof the success in France. A 7 P.M. tonight a cheer was given, and a round fired from every gun on the peninsula. Never heard such a noise. Again it is quiet\n","122":"\n\nRather a warm day. A few shells over from Asiatic side this morning. As far as I can find out no damage done. The Battery is still here. The camp routine is simply awful, drill all day. The demonstration last night, cost us the life of one Corporal head Quarter Staff (Aubrey). Also one horse killed and two wounded in 1st Battery Corp Aubrey was hit in 3 places with rifle bullets\n","123":"\n\nHead Quarters G.S. wagon knocked to pieces this morning, a direct hit from the Asiatic side, a 6in shell. 15 Turks surrendered on the 27inst. A few shells over this morning from Asia. The weather a bit warm today\n","124":"\n\nMarching orders recieved yesterday. Battery proceeds to Anzac. Wagon line embark in two days time for Embross, and then pick up more horses. Our boat is supposed to be the Prince Japan. The Battery moved\n\nout from here at 4 P.M. They got a good sent off, the guns from the Asiatic side opened fire on them. A few narrow escapes but no one injured. One shell fell about 40 feet from the pier.\n","125":"\n\nA terrific fog this morning, the first I have seen here. The Battery is just about broken up. 2 Sgts and nine men join a Howitzer Battery. Also 2 officers. I have 19 men with me in wagon line to look after 36 horses. We move on Saturday the 2nd inst, enroute for Alexandria. The 1st and 3rd Batteries moved out today, Friday. The Asiatic guns are giving them a send off similar to ours. What is left of our wagon line, remain here until further notice. It is a grand thing to hear of the successes the French are gaining. The French guns 9.2 are answering the Asiatic guns, quite a duel. We are now attached to the 42 Artillery Head Quarters for discipline. Yesterday, when our Major (Rabbett) left the wagon line, the first man he bid good bye to was me. He shook hands and wished me all sorts of good luck. I was never more surprised in all my life, he shook hands with all the men left in the wagon line. He is without\n\ndoubt an officer and a gentleman. Although a lot here gives him a bad name\n","126":"\n\nA terrific bombardment last night, on the right flank, held by the French, in fact a fair amount of shooting all day. Hostile aeroplane over this evening, just scouting about. A new hospital in position, and nine tents erected during the night. He just flew over it and made off. Two shots followed him. The Howitzer party left this morning at 6.45 enroute for Alexandria. The Battery is now in four pieces. We are now waiting for transport, things are at a standstill everything postponed. Today the Vet Officers horse is attached to the 2nd Battery. A note today from the provost Marshal, complaining of the state of the camp, rather sudden considering that the vehicles had hardly left. Heavy shooting by the Navy this evening over Krithia Village\n","127":"\n\nSunday nothing doing. Not a shot fired so far today. A large number of troops arriving. We are still waiting for orders to move. We have everything packed up ready\n\nto move. I hear we will get 2 hours notice. The 29th Division is back here again. The French 9.2 guns have just opened fire on the Asiatic coast, 4 oclock P.M. A most terrible bombardment this evening at 5.30. it lasted half an hour. Some beautiful shooting on the Turkish trenches. They replied fiercely, shells flying all over the place. We even had a rifle bullet fall near our cook house, the first I have noticed in this wagon line. The Navy also opened fire. Our horse exercise tonight was carried out bare back. The new hospital that I mentioned before got christened this afternoon, shells all over it. Last night 9 more E.P. tents were erected. They have a lot of stores on the beach, even mangles. The weather is again warm, but, thank goodness no wind. I see on a notice board on W beach that Sgt Short lost his purse containing £7.0.0, Blood stone & Ect on board the Prince Lenise. That is the boat the Battery went to Anzac on. We have in this Battery some of the biggest wasters it is possible to get together. For example, a few of the men that has been crimed in the wagon line only. One man went sick, would not go to the doctor, made him a\n\nprisoner, result 7 days C.B. The same man hitting a horse on the head with a sapling, 10 days C.B. Another man late on early morning parade 3 days C.B. Late the following morning 7 days C.B. The next morning late again 3 days C.B. that settled him. He was a 6th reinforcement Another man drunk on duty 28 days 2nd field punishment, awarded by C.O. Another man illtreating a horse 7 days C.B. Another absent from his post on guard 7 days C.B. Another man absent and asleep on piquet, remanded for O.C. Alexandria. Another insolence to a N.C.O. 3 days C.B. Another man 14 days C.B. refusing duty. Still another 7 day C.B. disobedience. Some of them are worth about 2\/- per day. Things are getting stirred up now 15 men to look after 37 horses. A little extra work wont hurt them\n\n4\/10\/1915\n\nMonday, this would be eight hours day in Sydney. Another man made a prisoner refusing to obey an order, under the impression he can run the show. Things exceptionaly quiet this morning, a few isolated shots over now and then, nothing to do\n\nany damage. Just recieved a special order, to be read to all troops on the peninsula\n\nSpecial order of the day\n\nGeneral Headquarters\n\n2nd October 1915\n\nThe following gracious message, from his Majesty the King was recieved yesterday by the Commander in Chief, and is published for information.\n\nWhile the army under your command is for the time being less strenuously engaged than heretofore, I wish to express my appreation of the manner in which it has fought under almost insuperable difficulties. The gallant deeds of the Australians and New Zealand\ners\n troops have been recieved through the empire with greatful admiration. I trust the health of the troops is satisfactory. Be assured that my thoughts are ever with you and them.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief has sent the following reply to his Majesty the King\n\nBuckingham Palace England\n\nYour Majestys gracious message, unaccountably delayed in transit, just recieved. Regret I cannot render very\n\nsatisfactory account of health of troops, though it shows slight tendency to improve. But their spirit is unquenchable. I shall at once take steps to make known to the troops your Majestys appreciation which shall be read by all ranks with pride and gratification and will stimulate them to still further efforts in your service\n\nIan Hamilton\n\nE.M. Woodward\n\nBrigadier General\n\nDeputy Adjutant General M.E.F.\n\nA terrific bombardment from the Asiatic side 6in shells buzzing about. One shell in particular bounced over 3rd Btys lines. A guard is mounted over it at present, waiting for the Naval authorities to destroy it.\n\nA Naval pennice was towing a barge when Asia opened fire on her. They put one shot into the River Clyde. It was hot and sweet while it lasted I thought we were done for. Had an augment with Vet Officer Capt Young, sent a Head Quarters horse over to be shod, feet in a terrible state, also bad with corns, contracted heels, sent over\n\nfor him to show him the foot. Oh he said shoe him with three quarter shoes. Asked him what his idea was, he said to take off pressure. I said don’t you think that there is another way to do it, he said no, well I said I do, with that I explained my way. I also said it is a nice thing sending horses over here for me to correct other peoples mistakes. He nearly went mad. It was the 1st Bty that shod him last, and that is the Battery he holds up as a model. However I done him my way. He knows as much about shoeing as a pig does about a side pocket. I did not forget to tell him that I have been shoeing these horses twelve months, and never had a horse pricked. When a man will tell you to lower the heels, and cut the foot down, and it will not matter if you draw the blood, well all I can say is that he is a real waster. The farrier of 3rd Bty, Bill Quelch cant get on with him at all, and to make matters worse he is camped at","128":" Btys wagon line\n","129":"\n\nToday is a beautiful day. Without doubt we are having lovely weather. A bit of shooting from Achi Baba this morning, 10.30 A.M. Some very close calls I can\n\nassure you. Saw a shell land in between two mule carts, and a horseman on one side, I think the horseman got hit, because he galloped back to camp. Another one just missed about 20 cyclists. The shells were small, somewhere about 13 lbs. had a man for office this morning, Refusing to obey an order, and silent contempt. He was awarded 14 days C.B. and 14 days pay stopped. We are still waiting for orders to move. An aeroplane duel this morning, one of our planes, and a hostile one, a sight worth seeing, our man used his machine guns, a large number of shots were exchanged. The enemy opened fire with their anti aircraft guns, it was an exciting time, we were held in suspence. Eventually our man drove him off. No official report to hand yet. I might say that we have a fleet of 200 aeroplanes at Embros.\n\nAs out Battery has left Cape Helles, and not likely to come back, it is just as well to note the number of shells fired, it was roughly 6,500 round. That is a bit diffrent to “A\" Battery in South Africa\n","130":"\n\nPlenty of shells over again today\n\nThey appear to be Howitzers. German aeroplane over this morning. We fired 20 shots at them, some close, others miles away. The Royal Naval Division are going to the trenches now. The enemy landed a shot or two into hospital tents. The new hospital started a day or so ago has grown to 31 tents\n","131":"\n\nFine weather still prevails, flies still troublesome. Shells over in our lines this morning, in fact it was a small bombardment. Another aerial duel this morning at 11.30, not so exciting as the last one. You cannot find out the result, you hear a machine gun rattle and see the aeroplanes circle around one another, and then you see some shells bursting about them, eventually they disperse, one going one way and one another. It is marvelous the little damage that is done by their shooting. With all of their shooting today, I don’t suppose they wounded a single man although I saw a shot land in the middle of a crowd of men, one or two got knocked over, but they got up laughing. Reinforcements for R.H.A. and R.F.A arrived this morning from Mudros\n\nThey were in France. \n\nAnother driver sent to hospital today, that leaves me with 14 drivers to attend to 37 horses. Things are livelier today than usual. Water carts, G.S. wagons, Motor Bikes, Motor Ambulances. Men on horses, Generals and their staff with orderlies. Fatigue parties. Reinforcements. Parties watering order. Indians with mules, Indians with flocks of sheep. Every body seems to be busy. The firing line is the quitest place today\n","132":"\n\nThe Naval Division (Howe Batt) got peppered this morning, and wonderful to say no one injured. They have only been in this position a week or two. They are about 150 yards in front of us. The new hospital they are forming, is the one from Lemnos. I hear they are dying wholesale there, from the effects of dysentery even the nursing sisters are suffering from it\n","133":"\n\nA terrible night, terrific thunderstorm which lasted most of the night. Wind blowing a gale. Most of the men got wet through. I was fairly lucky\n\nThe rain blew in a little. This morning is fine and clear, by all appearances it is going to be a fine day. A few large time shrapnel over at the back of our lines this morning. Another man went sick yesterday, Jaundice, (Bdr Fitzpatrick). That leaves the Saddler Sgt, an Acting Bdr and myself to run the show. Rumours of a stunt tomorrow, hundreds of infantry arriving. The Turks are putting over a fair quantity of shells today. Our aeroplanes very busy. Last night a battle ship shooting on Achi Baba, put in some beautiful shots, 10in I presume. From our wagon line you could see the dust getting stirred up by pieces of the shells. After the Navy fired a shot, the field Btys opened fire with time shrapnel. The damage must have been extensive. The V.O. and Lieut Shepperd had a narrow escape, about 10 A.M. a shot fired by the enemy fell about 2 feet from them. You could see nothing but a cloud of dust, dirt and smoke. Luckly no one was hurt, not even hit with a piece of dirt, it was a percussion shell\n","134":"\n\nDry morning, a little foggy. The new\n\nair ship, “Silver Queen\" flying along the coast. Her rate of speed is between 30 and 40 miles an hour. This is the first time I have seen her. She is employed looking for submarines, she has already sighted two but her bombs are a failure, they burst as soon as they toutch the water. The Turks are using a lot of ammunition this last day or two. This morning they are throwing them about. The French got busy and let fly some 9.2 shells at 10 A.M. I was watching them burst. An awful explosion smoke and dirt hurled into the air a hundred feet high. The Sgt Major of the R.N.D. R.E. Head Quarters is making a wooden cross and erecting it over the grave of Corp Aubrey of our Head Quarters. We had no time to do it, as the Battery was going to Anzac\n","135":"\n\nGerman aeroplane over 8.30 A.M. flying very low, our guns opened fire on him. Very hard target. Three of our men that were wounded, arrived here last night at 9.30 left again for Anzac at 10 A.M. Today is dull with indications of more rain. Still no signs of our leaving the peninsula.\n\nif something is not done shortly we will have no men to move our horses. Two horses with colic last night. Oh what a lovely Vetry officer we have he prescribed or tried to, and then asked me what I had, I told him Nitrous Ether, Aromatic Spts Amonia. He said 2 oz of each in a pint of water, and then he went on to say, give also one ball Ammon Carb and one Aloetic ball, and to cap all a gut full of water. I got the drench ready after a lot of sniffing and smelling by the Vet officer I started to give it, he then took the drenching horn out of my hand, and was showing me how to give it. The result was something to remember, he poured the lot over me, He then handed back the horn and walked away. The more I see of him the less I think about him. \n\nThe Turks seem to have plenty of ammunition they are pumping it in this morning. German aeroplane over again, getting very daring. Without doubt the Turks are a brave lot, they are giving us about as much as we want. \n\nThe Asiatic guns are blazing away just now 11 A.M. Trying to find the French 9.2 guns at the back of our lines\n\nI often expected them to wipe us out. We seem to be lucky, we get shells all around us. Either too far, too short, or to the right or left. Just a little strip where our horse lines are they miss. Another thunderstorm this afternoon, turned very cold. After the rain stopped it got hot again. It is now a beautiful bright night with a new moon. A little excitement this evening between an Indian and a driver R.H.A. This driver went to the 15 Indian mule corps water trough to water his horses naturally the sentry, who was an Indian went to stop him. The sentry went to hunt away the horses, and the result was they started to fight. The R.H.A. man hit the nigger in the mouth, the Indian picked up a large stone to hurl at the driver. Some of our men arrived on the scene and put a stop to it. The Indians were greatly excited, they reported the case to their officers, who told them if it occurred again to stick them with the baynot. The water supply in this well is to water 1500 mules. The R.H.A. has a well allotted to them\n","136":"\n\nFine dry morning, plenty of shells flying about. High Explosive time shrapnel over this morning at 10 oclock the first for two months, rather too high to do much damage. Some burst fair over lines. If they were 100 yards shorter, we would have got it in fine style\n","137":"\n\nRained again last night. Very cold and windy. A few shells over this morning one 4.7 time shrapnel. The new hospital recieved orders from the enemy to move. They say it is covering our landing place for troops and ammunition. I don’t know if our people will move it. This order was dropped from a Turkish aeroplane. We heard yesterday that the Batteries are at Anzac. A Corp of 3rd Bty is going there this morning. No information about our going away. Thousands of reinforcements are arriving here each night. The most sudden attack by our people to night at 7.15 I ever heard. A light appeared on the left flank, a rocket went up, and as it did so, every Battery fired one round gun fire, after that the rifles got to work, it lasted half an hour\n\nThen the Turks started shooting everywhere, they \nsure\n seemed to get excited, and burst their shells high in the air. This afternoon some H.E. over, killed one man and wounded three. Some Scottish Reg they belong to\n","138":"\n\nNot so cold this morning. The same old game (shelling). A bugle band in the French camp playing like fury, getting shelled all the time. It has now turned cold 10.50 A.M. \tThe changes here are very sudden. Wind blowing half a gale. Another man gone to hospital, to make matters worse he is our cook. Out of the original number, 2I I have 17. or, only 13 duty men. The French Artillery is doing a lot of shooting this morning.\n","139":"\n\nCaptain McLaughlan here last night, came over from Anzac to pay the H.Q. Staff men. He said things are hot over there, one of our Sgts, Short got a leg blown off, also an arm injured. This report is not correct I saw him later on 14\/12\/1915 he had seven wounds, he is again well and on duty. A shell fell in our dressing station killed two men. The shelling here\n\nthis morning is something awful, the Asiatic guns, One in particular, a high velosity got to work and done a lot of damage, one shell in particular, on a new target, men and clothing blown to pieces. I was about 600 yards off, and could see it quite plain. Today the Navy is doing a lot of shooting over on the Asiatic coast. A howitzer Battery put in 50 shots in half an hour this morning 60 lbs. Our Batteries, that is the British opened fire this morning and kept going a couple of hours. The weather today is windy and dusty, but not cold. 2 P.M. The enemy at it again, shells coming over galore. These are the dangerous days too much wind, you cant hear the shells coming, before you know where they are they get you. George Rose playing the fool again got drunk here before the Battery left for Anzac, and went for a ride, fell off horse, carried to our H.Q. by a couple of imperial men, of course the C.O. was there put him under arrest. He was Bty S.M. Now he is a Corporal\n","140":"\n\nFine morning, Saturday, the wind has stopped altogether. Flie very bad, cold weather don’t effect them. A few\n\nshells over this morning. Had some nasty time shrapnel 4.7 over last evening about 5 oclock, a large piece of shell fell on Farrier \ns\n Quelch dugout. The fight between an Indian, and a driver of R.H.A. battery as mentioned before, is creating a disturbance, I had to go to Y Battery wagon line and identify the man. However he turned out to be the wrong man. The guilty man is in B Battery R.H.A. We have here, landed last Tuesday the Ayrshire Yeomanry turned into infantry. They go to the trenches on Sunday. At 10.45 A.M. some beautiful time shrapnel over\n","141":"\n\nMore rain last night with indications of some more today. A little wintry with plenty of wind today. A lot of reinforcements going to the trenches now. The usual performance plenty of shells flying about, otherwise things very quiet\n\n18\/10\/1915\n\nRained last night rather heavy. We had a night out last night. Brought up two Btys A. B. 56 brigade. Finished at 4 A.M. Terrible lot of shelling going on today. Some very large shells coming from\n\nAchi Baba, fell almost in 17th B.A.C. 16,000 men landed on the peninsula last week. Had to go again to Y battery wagon line, to give evidence pending a court martial. I brought men to prove he was the wrong man. To make matters worse this man only joined the Battery the day before the asault was commited. He carries two good conduct badges. He was greatly excited. The collecting of evidence was ordered by the Divisional Commander.\n\nHeard this morning that General Ian Hamilton has left here, and Smith Dorrien takes his place.\n\nAnother man sent to hospital today suffering from Jaundice, that leaves me with 12 men for 37 horses, and to make matters worse, I had to send three men to 6th battery wagon line to help groom their horses, 90 minutes was the time alloted. The 6th has 6 horses to 1 man. The navy in action put about 60 shots in a nulla on Achi Baba. They are now putting in some H.E. They make a terrific report, you can feel the ground shake. They stopped for a few minutes\n\nand the Turks put some 4.7 time shrapnel over. They are coming over thick and heavy, a bit of a bombardment. The weather is cool and cloudy\n","142":"\n\n50 Turks captured by French last night by all accounts they are in a terrible state, ¼ rations, cholera, Dysentery and Typhoid raging amongst them. About 100 Artillery reinforcements went through our camp this morning. All night the Artillery and infantry were firing, with an occasional shot from a monotor. Blowing a gale\n\n20\/10\/1915\n\nMore rain this morning, windy and cold. A sharp attack at \n10\n 5.30 A.M. a great deal of rifle fire, dozens of shells coming over at the back of our lines. Another hundred yards or so of a switch and they will be on to us. At 5 A.M. a private in the French army was shot, trying to kill his Sgt. One man killed and 3 wounded by a high explosive shell, these men belong to some infantry Regiment going to the trenches. The","143":" City of London Royal Fusiliers has landed here,\n","144":"\n\nAnother night out last night. A and B Batteries 56th Brigade taken up into action, their position is a forward one in Achi Baba nulla. It was a grand moonlight night. As luck would have it the enemy was fairly quiet. A lot of Artillery fire on right flank, a sort of Artillery duel. The Turks peppering the French and the French peppering the Turks. A few shots over our way this morning. A shell landed in amongst those Batteries we moved yesterday, killing 3 mules and knocked down a telephone post. A most noticeable thing here is the migration of birds from the","145":" to the 25th of this month it is most pronounced. Terrific rifle fire all along the line. Enemy aeroplane over, dropped one bomb, infantry firing volleys at him, he got away quick and lively, this happened at 10 A.M. Thursday. This aeroplane was brought down later in the day, by the French. A section of trench was captured by the H.L.I. without opposition\n","146":"\n\nYesterday was the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalga. Rumour had it\n\nthat a battle was going to take place on that day. Hardly likely, considering that we beat the French there. Last night was the roughest we put in here. Blowing a gale all night. It is now raining, very steady. Wind still blowing. Weather very cold.\n","147":"\n\nRained all night and still raining this morning, Almost freezing. 7 A.M.

A Bdr and 2 men reported to wagon line yesterday 22nd inst for duty. One man Bennett been away three months. The Bdr (Fitzpatrick) away 2 weeks Jaundice. The other man Jackson was wounded.\n\nA few high explosives along the coast this afternoon at 4.30. Plenty of rifle fire, tonight with a few Artillery shots. Rather a peculiar way they have of working the Artillery. They\n\nfire about 12 shots in as many seconds, and then stop for some time\n","148":"\n\nArtillery fire practically all night, very pronounced at 5.30 A.M. Wintry conditions still prevails, with isolated showers. The wind is still blowing.\n\nHad to report at B Battery wagon line today. Evidence for a court martial.

The Indians here are suffering. Scurvy has broken out amongst them. The Sgt Major has to go over to Embros Island once a week and buy vegetables for them. Their meat allowence is 2 oz per day. The cold is playing havoc with them. Some beautiful shots over this morning. Pieces flying about our lines. Saw a lot of jackets and pants go up into the air, several men killed.

Still another rumour that we move from here in seven or eight days. Some nasty shells over 10 A.M. again pieces were flying over our horse lines. A lucky thing that most of them did not burst. A warship put 2 shots into the Turkish communication trench must have been a 14in, and then the field Btys opened out on them They started to run. The same ship put in 5 more shells into the Turkish trenches. This happened at 8 P.M.\n","151":"\n\nVery mild morning, cloudy, flies simply awful.

The Naval Division down from the trenches\n\n28\/10\/1915\n\nA quite morning, fine weather again, inclined to be warm. Flies terrible. Nothing doing in the trenches. The Saddler, a Bdr and myself bought some potatoes and tomatoes from the S.M. Indian Mule Corps. He has to go over to Tenedos every week for vegetables for the Indians. The authorities had to cut out their meat not on account of the price, although it is high £4 for an Indian sheep but on account of disease. The French wagon line alongside of ours moved yesterday to a position further forward. It took them all day to do it. The Vet officer and Farrier of the 6th Battery are at logger heads.

The driver fell, his foot caught in the stirrup, the mule was kicking at him all the time, and to make matters worse, the leaders swerved, and the wagon run over the driver.

In our wagon line you can hardly hear the report of the guns. One good thing about the wind , it is in our favour, and the rain has settled the dust. It is now almost dark, the bombardment is still on. I was watching it just now from a hill, shells bursting all along the line. During the afternoon the French 9.2 were at it, firing over on the Asiatic coast the Turks answered it, a few 6in shells in our lines, dangerously close, one just skipped over our horse lines and burst with a terrific noise\n","170":"\n\n8.30 Terrific thunderstorm, lightning very vivid. A fierce attack was on during the storm, rifle fire very strong. The R.N.D. captured 25 yards of communication trench yesterday. The Scottish were to advance and try to capture a trench. Today is cloudy, inclined to be cool. Our lines were visited by Capt Stewart\n\nV.O in charge of Base Hospital. Some very sarcastic remarks passed by Capt Young, about horses turned out as cured from Vet hospital. Capt Stewart picked him up instantly, and told him that a certain horse should have a bullet in him, If he could not do it, to send it down to the hospital, and he would damn soon do it. \n\nJust heard that the result of the bombardment was good. We captured a trench with scarsely any opposition, simply walked into it. We actually massacred the Turks. Further reports say we captured two trenches, Our casualties were one killed and one wounded.\n","171":"\n\nCounter attacks last night by the Turks 7 in all. Our Artillery firing from 9 P.M. till 11 P.M. very rapid. \n\nThe weather today is cold and miserable. The Turks were repulsed each time with heavy losses. Our bomb makers are working overtime. We are rushing every available bomb thrower up to the trenches, a lot of infantry are also being sent up. A peculiar thing all these moves happened just after Kitcheners visit.

We are trying a new move, harassing the enemy, by shooting all night, and also by using a lot of bombs. A new bomb is being tried, it is filled with petrol and shrapnel bullets, also an explosive. When the bomb bursts, the petrol catches alight, and burns anything it comes in contact with. The particular\n\npurpose for which this bomb is used for is, the destruction of sand bags used in the construction of parapets. The Sgt major and Q.M. of D Bty 66 Brigade up for Court Martial.

Terrible slaughter amongst our men, legs and arms strewn about all over the place. We held our own. The Turks charged, they were driven back with fearful losses, we gained 3 more trenches. It was a terrible night. Bitterly cold, wind blowing a gale, and light rain. Even now at 4.20 P.M. the Artillery are blazing away. This is the fiercest fighting since June the 4th. All this happened on our left flank, our weakest point. It was held by the Scottish Regiments\n","177":"\n\nBitterly cold again. Terrific shooting last night. A fair amount of Artillery fire today. \n\nPeninsula press No 88. 15\/11\/1915\n\nOur aircraft have carried out some brilliant reconnaisances, combined with bomb attacks on roads, bridges and consentrations. Besides effectively spotting the ships guns on to the targets mentioned above, they have attacked, among others the following important points. The junction at Ferijik, the railway bridge at Kuleli Burgas (repeatedly damaged by heavy bombs), Camps and marching columns in the KAVAK.KESHAN-UZUN.KEUPRU.ADRIANOPOLI area. Severe casualties have been caused by dropping 20 and 100 lbs bombs among troops in camp. On some occasions our airmen have first ascertained that camps were occupied by dropping hand grenades among the tents and then on a rush being made by the Turks to cover in adjutant gullies, they have dropped 100 lb bombs amongst them with devasting results. Last night a particularly brilliant night flight was made of 4 ½ hours duration 100 lb bombs were dropped from a height of only 400 feet on the railway bridge at KULELI.BURGAS cutting the line, and a valuable reconnaisance of Turkish camps were made, right up to\n\nAdrianopole.

A spy captured. The 66th heavy Bty 9.2 inch, put in\n\nin 15 rounds into a German gun position, one direct on a gun. The remainder within a radius of 35 yards.

Shells bursting all around A fine sight, just dark enough to show up the bursts. He got through. Rather a good scheme worked off by the Artillery yesterday. One Battery firing on the first line trenches. The enemy left them, as they did so, another Bty opened fire on them, and drove them into the supports, another Bty followed them into the communication trench, and still another Bty followed them into open country.

A terrible misfortune\n\nfor the British Army. Great sorrow in the force. Cloudy and a little rain this morning. Things quiet. Our trenches were flattened out by the enemy yesterday. Although we say trenches, they are actually parapits. Can’t dig trenches here, strike water. So to get sufficient cover, embankments are erected. All telephones cut off from 10 A.M. til 3 P.M.
