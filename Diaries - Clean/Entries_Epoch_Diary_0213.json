Was accepted to go as driver with the Sig Engs.\n","2":"\n\nAfter a week's encampment we (62) left NSW for B'meadows Vic. Mother DorothyTed &Charlie were up at the station to wish me God's speed.\n","3":"\n\nArrived after a tedious journey\n\nat Broadmeadows. We were very tired on our arrival at the Camp.\n","4":"\n\nWe started our training as usual, as our days we all be the same & nothing of real vital importance happens. I will label it all up to a certain period Camp Monotony.\n","5":"\n\nWe embarked on the H.M.A.T. Karroo after our ride through\n\nBrunswick Melbourne.\n","6":"\n\nLeft Melbourne Harbour 4.5.\n\nNext port Albany. Very impressive sight all parents crying & the usual parting scenes.\n","7":"\n\nAfter a very calm trip we arrived in King Georges Sound to await until all the troops numbering 20,000 muster in the bay.\n\nNov.1st\n\nAfter a week in port we\n\nleft Albany this morning. The entire fleet are now making their way to the old country, our convoy being the Sydney Melbourne Minotaurand the Jap Ibuki . Raining & inclined to be squally.\n","8":"\n\nWe have lost sight of land about 6 this evening. The sea is working up to a storm. Wind blowing a hurricane. Was vaccinated.\n","9":"\n\nSea still very choppy but not rough. We have just caught up to the W.A fleet including\n\ntwo troopships & 2 cruisers.\n","10":"\n\nWe passed two horses overboard. My Grey very sick. This evening the sea has calmed considerably.\n","11":"\n\nDuring the night the grey was down & given up for dead, during morning he brightened up. At 6.15 the mail steamer (Osterly) caught us up en route for England.\n","12":"\n\nSea very calm. Weather very hot, we are getting farther &\n\nfarther north every day. At lunch to-day orders were read out to theeffect that should we get word that the enemy are sighted we are to close all port holes & guards & await instructions.\n\nOne horse over this morning.\n","13":"\n\nWeather very hot. Stifling on the horse. Wearing pyjamas. To-night we had a concert was a great success. Before the concert I had box with one of the boys & dislocated my thumb.\n","14":"\n\nWe expect to to reach Colombo in six days & the equator in four. Thumb still very painful. We had our church parade this morning conducted by the Captain. At present there is every indication of a storm working up.Later. Wind gone down & sea calming. Still very hot.\n","15":"\n\nIndeed a day of excitement. At 11 AM this morning we receive a wireless from the \"Sydney\"what she waspursuing the German Cruiser Emden. Another message\n\nhas just come through, that the Sydney has beached & blown up the Emden on Cocos Is. 11\/40News further states that the Sydney had lost two men & 13 wounded. Although all the boys were very sick with the effects of vaccination & nearly baked with the heat they all went mad with the good news. The Captain of the Ship on the strength of the news issued free beer to all. The \"Melbourne\" sent a wireless message congratulating the Sydney on her success. The N.Z. Wanganui offered her music room as accomadation for the wounded off the Sydney.\n","16":"\n\nThis morning I volunteered my services as ship's dentist. My application has been accepted & granted. I am off all duties except my own profession. Heat absolutely awful. We expect to reach the line in a couple of days.\n","17":"\n\nHeat awful. We all get about with as little on as possible. This evening we had the beginning of the boxing Compo. I was picked to fight Monty, through my own carelessness I was K.O. in the","18":" round.\n\nNov.12th\n\nHeat excessive. We expect to cross the line to-night or to-morrow morning. Great preparations are in progress for the ceremony of crossing. I am heartily sick of the trip. The sooner we arrive in England the better.\n","19":"\n\nThis morning a canvas tank was erected in the fore well deck to give all those who have not crossed the line before a ducking.

Sun.\n\nThis morning when I got up we were in sight of land. We arrived in Colombo at 9 A.M. At 11.45 we anchored. What a gaudy looking place this is! This harbour at present is crowded with our troops. The natives seem to have \n\ngone mad with excitement. The Cruiser arrived here followed by the\"Empress of Russia\" carrying all the prisoners off the Emden. The loss of the Emden crew was 200 killed & 30 wounded. This evening Colombo looks beautiful. On my right is the European Quarters & on the left is the dirty native Quarters. The lights on shorefor the troop ships make this port look twice the size it is.\n","21":"\n\nThis morning we were beseiged by all small craft selling fruit, cig. etc. I bought oranges that had green skins but were ripe\n\ninside.We were advised by the O.C. not to eat much fruit on account of fever. We were having a usual jolification when a officer came out & told us Maj. Mackworth's brother had been killed, so would we mind if we kept quite Tis very warm tonight and as usualam sleeping on deck.\n","22":"\n\nAt 9.30 this morning we weighed anchor & moved out of port on our way to the next port - Aden.Extracted upper left molar for one ofthe ship crew.

Our convoy at the present is the Ibouki Hampshire & Yarmouth. Part of our fleet we left at Colombo. They will catch us up en-route.\n","25":"\n\nI am a good deal better though not appetite. Sea very calm & weather. Nothing of interest to write down.\n","26":"\n\nThis morning I went on with the horses as formerly. As a driver I was compelled to. To-night we had the semi final of the heavies. Davis was beaten on points by Butler. Boys were all disappointed. After the boxing we had our usual concert. Some of the artists were real good but their\n\n\n\nwere a few who sang gruesome songs of dying soldiers that makes everybody miserable. The master of the boat sang a song also, being master he was applauded. Weather perfect. We are on our way very slowly to P. Said .\n","27":"\n\nWeather still very straight. I was informed this morning that we would arrive in England on Dec. 18th & have a week off for Xmas. Heartily hope so as I can then have a good time with Bertha who has been away from Aust for about8 years.\n","28":" 23, Mon.\n\nI have the day off. This morning at eight oclock we sighted land. It is SocotraIsland, it has a pop. of 12000 mostly Arabs, Spaniads, Bedouins etc. Very lazy lot, too tired toexport any of their products. It looks a very deserted place, one peak I can see is 4300 ft. We will be in sight of land until this evening.\n","29":"\n\nOut of sight of land this morning. Sea still calm & weather excellent.\n","30":"\n\nThis afternoon we sighted land again. We are now in Aden. We willstay here the night. This place is also mountainous.Have just written to Manly N. Sydney & Wyoming, will post them first opportunity.\n","31":"\n\nThis morning at 7 o'clock we left here (Aden). What a lovely place it is seems. I was told that defaulters from India are sent here to do garrison duty for 12 mths. We are going at 10\n\nknots, as Hells Gates are 96 miles away we expect to reach it about 5 this afternoon. Three transports have passed us on their way back from England. At 11 o'clock I was again inoculated the last dose was but a half. I wonder what they will do next. The trip from this on will I think be interesting as we will be in sight of land most of the time.\n","32":"\n\nThis morning I am fairly ill on a\/c of inoculation but am doing my duty as usual. Tonight we had the final of the\n\nheavies . Jack White won. Butler gave in at the end of second round.\n","33":"\n\nToday is our day of sports. All the usual kind of games are being played. I will probably enter for a few. At twelve to day a message came through saying complete training at Cairo & then proceed to the front. Whether this news is authentic or not remains to be seen I will be very sorry if our fighting is to take place in Egypt. The sports are on now. At tug o war the ships officers beat our officers by a few inches\n\nto night after a great fight. The Sig CoyCaptained by F. Bohn beat the AS Corps.\n","34":"\n\nWind blowing stronger than usual & getting much cooler. As yet we still beleive we are going to Cairo. I had a long talk with one of the ship's cadets. I am giving him a letter of introduction to my people in Manly.\n","35":"\n\nFairly chilly this morning. Land still out of sight. We expect to sight land this evening. \nLater\n This afternoon we came in\n\nsight of the coast of the Gulf of Suez. Wind\ning\n blowing very strong. Am still sleeping on deck. This evening I saw the most beautiful sunset I have ever seen. I spent the evening with the Middyin his cabin.\n","36":"\n\nThis morning we woke up to find ourselves well up the Gulf. We expect to get to the Canal at 1 PM. Orders were read out this morning telling us of the promotions etc. Also that we leave this ship next Friday at Alexandria. \nLater\n We are now in the Gulf.\n","37":"\n\nWe are still out side the canal. We are waiting for a search light. This morning we were beseiged by a \nsmall\n fleet of boat selling cig. fruit, turkish delight etc. At 3.30 this afternoon we entered the canal. Next stop P. Said. We passed a lot of Indian troops camped on the edge of the canal. Everything seems strange. Instead of water each side we have the banks of the Canal. It is fairly chilly. As we expect to be fired upon we have had orders that should the boat give the alarm -\n\n\n\nfour blasts of the ships whistle, the sappers & N.C.O.s in charge are to go to the troop deck & drivers to stand to the horses.\n","38":" 3rd,Thurs.\n\nAt 6.30 this morning we arrived at P. Said. This port is the biggest we have seen since we left Melbourne. The natives (Arabians) are a much higher caste than we met at Colombo. This afternoon \nwe\n I received a letter from Alma & the mater.\n","39":"\n\nThis evening about 5 we weighed anchor. We expect to reach\n\nAlexandria to-morrow morning. Wind very strong I saw the monument of De Lesseps of Suez fame.\n","40":"\n\nThis morning early we arrived outside the harbour of Alexandria. About 10.o'clock we made our way into the wharf. I was very much impressed by the buildings in this city.\nLater\n.We are now unloading horses, wagons fodder etc. We will be working until late this evening.\n","41":"\n\nStill alongside unloading. After the roll call this evening H. Peachy & myself broke leave and took a trip into Alexandria. We took a tram from the Quay to the City proper, had a argument over the money. Thebourse here is a fine building.We also went into a picture show cost us 2 piastres each. We hired a carriage to take us back.

Passed heaps of cotton fields on the edge of the Nile. At 1 p.m. we reached Cairo. After we got all the horses out of the train, the Egyptian Gov. gave us all a roll of bread, cheese & cocoa. We watered horses at the barracks & then moved off on foot to the Camp at Menanear the Pyramids, a distance of 10 miles, terribly tired but interesting nevertheless. We have now\n\nreached our camping ground. No tea. To cap the lot, I have been put on picquet.\n","42":" 8th,Tues.\n\nThis morning when we woke up we could see the desert upon which we are camped. I have this day off. I went to see the Pyramids. We went right inside. After a long walk down a narrow channel until we reached the Queen's Chamber, from there we went up highed until we came to King's Chamber. Very hot inside.

This afternoon I took our horses for a long ride all around this part & back home around the Pyramds.\n","52":"\n\nWe groomed as usual this morning & this afternoon I took the horses out of Camp to a native village. Had a great walk around the old city that an American Syndicate are\n\nunearthing.\n","53":"\n\nUsual work, nothing of interest.\n","54":"\n\nThis morning we exercised & this afternoon I get off. Butlin & I went into Cairo. We had a bath at the Bristol, had our \nof the\n tea at one of the quantity of CafÃ¨s. The musicians played La Paloma for me.

Never in my wildest imaginations did I picture myself here for a Xmas. I gave the horses two hours exercise this morning. Before we started our dinner to day one of the boys took our photos all sitting at the table. We had a great dinner considering where we are & also being on Active Service. Before dinner to day a great pleasant surprise was in store for me, I received a letter from my sister Bertha. The letter made me feel happy. I am going\n\nto write to her this day.

Mean to write and tell A.G. We visited the native Bazar where I experienced for the first time a Goblet Ã la Wassah. Very expensive.

Then fell in with bombardier of F.A. who gave us a lift in his carriage, but transfered from there into passing tram\n\nfrom there passed into oblivion until we reached terminus½ hour late.\n","66":" 31,Thurs.\n\nThis evening Bohm & myself passed a pleasant morning conversing on Dickens. My old stomach trouble again visited me & I passed a miserable evening in mind & body. But beleive camp was very merry celebrating the old year out.

So ends the old year.\n\n"}}
