Met at Station by Officer & Sergeant Major & marched to Camp some 3 miles distant. \n\nArrived at Camp, pitched tents & turned in very tired.

The day was spent in squad drill with Lecture thrown in after Tea. S M informs us chaps from N.S.W that we need not think we could play up in Victoria if we were allowed to in N.S.W. He informed us in delightful language that they had a barb wire fence and he was not frightened to use it. A foolish remark for a man in his position to make.\n\non such short acquaintance. I told the Boys I thought his bark was worse than his bite. Fine lot of fellows in Unit\n","4":" \n\nFirst riding test very funny. On leaving N.SW unit was formed hurriedly and nobody worried whether one was a Horseman or otherwise. Same thing occurred in other states. Unit was formed at three days notice as Mounted Ambulance for Camel Corps & expected to sail in a week. However after Breakfast the order was given to fall out all who could ride. Out of fear of perhaps not going away everybody made up their mind that they could ride. Our O.C. Capt Heath (a sport) said we will see whether you are all Jockeys. We\n\nmarched across to Light Horse stables & saw the mokes. A Horsey looking individual informed the OC that the Horses were rather fresh (NB. They looked it). The OC with a smile said we were all accomplished riders. We felt like whistling some cheerful ditty (The Dead March perhaps) However when the order was given to saddle up it resulted in one rush for the Horses that looked quiet (my tip things are not what they seem) However with assistance we all saddled up & formed in line. A Sergeant Major appeared and made a few remarks on the handling of Horses. His remarks were full of eloquence & perhaps his occupation prior to enl was a Auctioneer. We were told that we were each to do a gallop\n\n \n\nin turn at certain interval. One started all right, then they all started and what a mess. Some galloped to the river, some in circles and some cleared back to the Stables. A number fell off & my neddy went for his stall. Had I not ducked in time would probably have woke up in Hospital Thus ended our first Riding Test. About 50% failed.\n","5":" \n\nRoute march to Goulbourn River along road leading to Trawool .Rations on Route, Bully, Biscuits & Tea. Distance about 16 miles by road.\n","6":" \n\nLeave to Melbourne.

New Zealanders struck me as a particularly fine body of men, well built, big & seemed fine fellows. Our way lay along a well made metalled road leading to Ismalia with the sweet water canal alongside the road. It is remarkable the traffic along this shallow canal. Barges very unwieldy vessels, manned by Egyptians (usually pretty dirty) carry surprising loads of Horse fodder & rations. We crossed over the Canal at London\n\nBridge manned by our well known friends the Military police and down to the lake through a clump of date palms & small gardens. What a rush by the young Gyppos selling Oranges, Dates, & Peanuts. The lake looked very enticing on this very hot day & we lost no time stripping and enjoying our first swim since we left Australia. The water of the lake is very salt and is connected with Suez Canal. Two warships lay at anchor & many small boats, Launches & Feluccas were on the lake.

Went over to remount & we had to saddle up & ride Mules. Of all the obstinate\n\nanimals in the world the Mule wins. For a time after we were mounted there were Mules & the boys everywhere. The remount boys rounded us up again. Fine horsemen these fellows. Saw Tom disappearing over horizon on the neck of a Mule. One of the Mules caught in Red’s belt & he thought the Mule was trying to have a meal from him.\n\nEventually we got into formation but all day these dam mules played up. They have a mouth like iron & have formed opinion that only thing to do when they bolt is to \nsight\n sit tight & ride them. Remount boys tell us they have just arrived & need breaking in. I believe it.\n\nBarnsfather would have found some good material for his sketches could he have seen us today. \n","172":"\n\nHanded in all surplus kit to day. Saw Camelian to day. Funny little animals something like a lizard. Peculiar point is that they can change colour. Useful as fly catcher. Egypt commonly called land of Flies, Sand & Dirt. All well\n","173":"\n\nUsual routine. Hot windy day\n","174":"\n\nIsolation lifted today. Now we shan’t be long.\n","175":"\n\nLeave to Ismalia today Tom Charley, Jimmy & my self went in \n\nIsmalia pretty little town with its level asphalt roads with large trees on each side making it cool & shady. Hired Gharry a vehicle which are extensively used in this country and resemble a vehicle known as a landau in Ausy. Very comfortable to ride in. We drove through the Gardens which looked beautiful & down to the lake. From here round town Ismalia is only a small place and is inhabited by all Nationalities chiefly Gyppos. Quite a number of Frenchmen hold good positions in connection with administration of Suez Canal. We visited all the shops with their Souvenirs & Curios. Went through Arabic Quarter (a filthy place) & generally had a good time. The lock at Ismalia is a very ingenious \n\naffair. One sees the flat bottomed barges as previously described waiting in rows of perhaps a mile long for the lock to open & water to find its own level. I wonder why the average Gyppo is such a dirty man. Indian & Greek shopkeepers seem to have a good hold here. We had a good meal\n\nat café quite a change after camp food & started back for camp at 7 pm. Imagine our surprise on reaching London Bridger where (our “friends\" the “Military Police\" Guard\") to be placed under arrest for breaking Leave We were escorted back to Camp under escort of Bayonets. (Explanations are no use with these coves) On arrival at Camp the mistake was discovered & the brainy APM was not man enough to apologise but quietly faded away. Thus ended our first leave in Egypt\n","176":"\n\nSome of the Light Horse Reinforcements leaving to join units.

Six of the boys left behind. Very dissapointed. Caught train Moascar 10.20 AM. My first view of this portion of Egypt. The journey down was very pleasant through the\n\ncultivated areas so well irrigated. The natives still farm as in the olden days one reads of in the bible You see the old fashioned plough with its one piece of wood drawn sometimes by Bullocks, Donkeys or even Camels. I did see one drawn by a camel & Donkey which struck me as being very amusing. The seed is cast broadcast as of old. The old fashioned Wells & methods of cutting the grain is a wonderful sight to one who has not seen it before. The villages are usually a cluster of mud houses, flat roofs used as a rubbish heap, narrow lanes, where Goats, Dogs, Fowls & family live all together. There are no signs of sanitation & the wonderful thing is that they do not all die\n\ndisease for a Gyppo village has a odour distinctly its own.\n\nAt the stations the Gippos make plenty of noise with their Eggs are cooked etc. We passed through Tel el Kebir the graveyard where some of the fallen if previous wars lay at rest. It looked very pretty with its abundance of flowers & Greenery & appeared to me to be well looked after. Tag a Tig was a junction and appeared a Town of Fair size. We arrived at Cairo at 1.20 pm & were bundled into two Trams & taken to Abbasia some two miles from Cairo. Here we camped near 14 AG.H & 31st General Hospital. We placed in large huts near a refreshment room which sold everything a soldier needs \n\nat a reasonable price. On first appearance camp impresses me as very favourable.\n","187":" \n\nFirst leave in Cairo. Left camp at Abbasia & hired a donk for 2 piastres. Across the sand to Heliopolis Car Very fine & up to date Electric Railway carrying 1st & 2nd Class passengers.\n\nThe journey is only 10 minutes from Heliopolis to Cairo. Tom Charley Jimmy & I went to view the sights. On arrival at Cairo we were surrounded by Gyppos of all ages wanting to clean Boots, sell all sorts of rubbish. However we cleared them out & hired a Gharri for two hours to drive round. Cairo to my mind is undoubtedly a Continental City One sees all Nationalities. How \n\neager the majority of the business people seem to want to sell (Australians particularly) a number of souvenirs & rubbish. The streets in many cases are very narrow & the Trams make one incessant clanging with their bells & the yelling of the excitable Egyptian Drivers. Trams are Electric but small. We had dinner at Petrogad a first class Hotel finishing the evening by a visit to the Kursall (Vaudeville House) One could spend hours sitting in a Café watching the Cosmopolitan crowd pass by. Drove back to camp & sneaked in just after roll call.\n","188":"\n\nWe visited Pyramids & Sphinx today. Situated some 10 miles from Town. Drove out in Motor Beautiful drive along absolutely flat road.\n\nasphalted most of the way and shaded by trees. On way down from the City across the River Nile over a massive bridge, then along the banks of the River for some distance passing the Gardens & Zoo. Along the banks of the Nile are some beautiful stone water frontages residences. Some of them owning some magnificent Houseboats. On arrival at Pyramids which are situated close to Mena Camp we had our first view of the Sphinx & Pyramids at close quarters. What a magnificent piece of architecture they are. We engaged a guide also donkeys to ride round & view them. We went inside the large Pyramid having to take off our Boots & crawl in. One wonders by what\n\nmeans they managed to raise the huge blocks of stone in position. A Fortune teller informed us how these Pyramids were built by Billy Hughes 2000 B.C. It was Sunset on leaving and the \nsight was magnific\n last rays of the sun shining on the Pyramids was a remarkable view. We spent the evening driving round the Native quarter of the Town. The Native quarter is absolutely filthy. Prostitution in Cairo seems to be a business so the less written of Cairo’s morals the better\n","189":"\n\nWe had a try out on camels today. Our education is not yet complete enough to justify us riding. We had explained to us, the art of tying of the knots in saddling and\n\njust a few of the camels peculiaritys. I am making a few remarks of my impressions at present of the Camel. It does not strike me as being the most graceful or fascinating animal I have seen.\n\nHe seems. I quote he as my Camel fortunately or unfortunately (time will tell) is of that \nmal\n sex. The Camel strikes me as a haughty individual & seems to fix one with a glassy stare. This long legged, humpty backed & knock kneed animal does not make one feel as if he could ever become intimate. The Camel has a dandy set of Teeth & is I am told fond of using them. I saw a youth this morning cutting out distance and a unwieldy object chasing him looking like \n\na Tank but on closer inspection turned out to be a Camel. The lips of a Camel are flabby & hang down inviting you to tickle them (Dont) When one approaches a Camel he usually makes a gurgling sound and throughs out a balloon sort of arrangement and bubble. This we are told is a sign of pleasure. Let us hope he never gets angry. However I anticipate some fun when we first saddle up & mount for our first ride.\n","190":"\n\nFirst ride on Camels today (what a day) We saddled up in sections & were told on the order to mount to draw the Camels head round by the head chain place one foot on his neck, cross legs and gently slide into the saddle, then\n\nmake the Camel rise & form into sections. This is what occurred. On the command prepare to mount we drew the head round & Jimmys Camel nearly had Breakfast off Jimmys leg. On command mount the fun started Bill Bayley being a short cove could not step on the Camels t neck so made a spring for it & missed burying his nose in the sand. Half the Camels started to rise & some of the Boys clinging to the saddle, the saddle slipped & they did some spinning nose dives. Camels all over the place. OC. Nearly went mad. Result four men in Hospital & some of the others have the wind up already. \n","191":"\n\nFeeding, Grooming & a watering parade. A mornings work with a Camel. Bad Aeroplane smash this morning. Pilot killed. What a thirst a camel has when he does drink. I think my Camel has all the Ticks in the world judging by numbers I found on him this morning. On Picquet at night. Have christened my Camel Hobo because he hums.\n","192":"\n\nLeave to Cairo this afternoon. Visited Citadel where prisoners are kept. Well where Jacob was cast. Visited blue mosque & others. At Blue Mosque there is an Altar where cripples & sick people pray under belief they will be cured. A fine panoramic view of Cairo can be seen from tower of the Mosque\n\nI saw at one Mosque a pit connected to river Nile. Its sides were at one time covered with knives so that when persons were thrown in the pit their bodies would be \nthrown in the Nile\n be cut into small pieces on reaching bottom\n","193":"\n\nCamel riding to day with better success than last time. Visited Luna Park in evening. Luna Park situated at Heliopolis the cleanest & most beautiful place I have seen in this country. Wide, well made streets & big substantial stone building. Was I am told built for a second Monte Carlo but authorities would not permit it. Luna Park is a pleasure\n\nresort similar to White City Sydney. We had a most enjoyable evening.\n","194":"\n\nVisited Zoo at Cairo. Zoo situated 3 or 4 miles out of Cairo. Very nice place to spend afternoon. Was surprised at extent of Gardens & collections of animals & birds. There I heard the Egyptian Band. It struck me that the main object of life of most of the performers was to blow as hard as they could on the instruments. Had Tea at YMCA Gardens where praise must be given for the fine unselfish efforts of a few Ladies & Gentlemen in the interest of Soldiers. Evening we visited Kursall seeing the old comedy again Charley’s Aunt\n","195":"\n\nCame to Town. Heard Welsh Concert Band in Ezmekiah Gardens.\n\nIn evening had walk round Native Quarters & took tram ride to Rod El Faraq situated on banks of River Nile. We hired Felucca & sailed over to where there was a very large Melon patch. Sunset on the Nile sets one dreaming of Ausy.\n","196":"\n\nBack to our old friends the Camels. Riding, Grooming Feeding etc. Wrote mail evening.\n","197":" Went into Cairo. Saw Egyptian Wedding. All concerned seemed wildly excited over the event & dressed in Gaudy clothing,\n\nMight add that higher class Egyptian is entirely Westernised in his mode of \naddress\n dress. My remarks\n\nin this Diary only applies to the lower cast of Egyptian. An Egyptian funeral is also a very noisy affair. Spent usual pleasant evening.\n","198":"\n\nWent into Cairo on a round of visits to various Mosques. Inspected one which we were told was 3750 yrs old. We saw the vaults, gardens and the roof & some of the walks were inlaid with Gold & Carvings. One place was shown us by Guide which consisted of an air tight room where prisoners were shut in & smothered & then on being taken out were thrown down well into Nile. We also visited Mohammed Assan Mohammed Ali & Blue Tiled Mosque. All of them possessed luxurious Carpets, windows of coloured Glass beautifully matched & massive Marble pillars\n\nThe Blue Tiled Mosque was the prettiest. It is electrically lighted by thousands of small lights & we saw them switched on. The effect of these artificial lights on the glistening marble is a sight worth going along way to see. We then visited one of the turrets & had a magnificent panoramic view of Cairo. From here on to the Citadel where I understand some of the long term prisoners are kept. We saw the spot where a German Spy was shot. Joseph’s well & returned to Town after a most pleasant afternoon. In the evening our Unit gave an open air concert which turned out successful. \n","199":"\n\nOn \nPicquet\n Picket usual Routine to day.\n\nI have missed a page so intend devoting it to my \n\nimpressions of Bethlehem\n\nI visited Bethlehem on June 5th. The distance from Jerusalem is about 7miles. The first sight on the road is the old Greek Church where Elijah rested. Then we come to Rachaels Tomb where Jacob buried Rachael & proceeded on his journey to Hebron. At the entrance to the Town is the well of Bethlehem. Down below Bethlehem is the pasture of the Wilderness where David kept his sheep. On the slopes leading up to the town are the cornfields where Ruth gleaned.\n\nFrom Bethlehem looking Eastward the view of the Dead Sea in the distance & the mountains of Moab is a fine one Solomons pools supply water to the Town which is conveyed by an Aqueduct. Bethlehem is built on\n\ntwo hills & like other Eastern Towns has narrow cobble stone streets. The dress of the inhabitants is noticeable particularly the head dress of the women. \n\nI saw the Manger in the Church of Nativity where Christ was born & it impressed me very much. The birth of a Daughter in Bethlehem is not looked upon with much rejoicing. With a boy it is the reverse. The Bethlehem people struck me as being of a much superior type than any other place I had seen in Palestine. They tell me it is impossible to buy a Wife for less than £ 50 in Bethlehem. The girls are prettier than in most parts. In fact Bethlehem is looked upon as a superior place which to my way of thinking is correct.\n","200":" \n\nVisited the famous Mouskey or better known perhaps as the Bazaars. The Mouskey proper is the main street going from Ataba-el Khadra the tram junction right up on to the Desert to the hills & Caliph Tombs. The Bazaars are called by various names & lead off into many little streets & blind alleys. We saw the Goldsmiths Bazaar & Silver Bazaar where Gold & Silver is beaten & turned into various articles, a few steps further on one comes to the brass work carved & plain. All sorts of Jewels whether genuine or otherwise I do not know but they looked genuine to us. We saw the Sudan Bazaar where we saw Ivory Ostrich Plumes & Animal skins. We passed into the scent Bazaar from here to where they were weaving silk. Boys of tender years work in this ill ventilated hole. Anything from a \n\nneedle to an Anchor can be bought at the various Bazaars. The streets are so narrow that the shops opposite are within a few feet of one another. The average frontage is about 6ft & one see the proprietor of these shops or rather stalls sitting on his haunches. A great business is done in Curios many of which are faked. It is a wonder to me that half the population of Cairo is not wiped out living under the conditions they live under. I suppose we notice the difference so very much coming from Ausy where our own folk live under healthy conditions. It is my belief that half the lower cast of Egyptians have no fixed place of abode but simply sleep just where they can. What a surprise our home folk would get could they see these places.\n","201":"\n\nOn duty\n","202":"\n\nOn duty\n","203":"\n\nLast night in Cairo before leaving for the line.

Who knows we may not see it again. A small half starved little dog followed us about all day so we took him on the strength & took him with us.\n","209":"\n\nArrived at Kantara 12 noon. Found on arrival no arrangements had been made re baggage or Rations. After seeing various R.T.O. Officers & others Cpl made arrangements for G S Waggons to take baggage to Kantara East.

Our horses were in fine condition and they needed it all as was proved. At Beersheba we tried to water horses but failed. The horses had no water since dawn. Beersheba struck me on first impression as a small place of not very much importance. It was not until later that I knew what a bearing it had on Gaza which fell shortly after. We rode out from Beersheba which was practically a mass of ruins owing to our bombardment by artillery & found ourselves on the road which was absolutely blocked with traffic. The wounded were coming in freely & what a rough spin they had in the big motor waggons. After\n\nmany delays we camped on side of road as it was absolutely useless trying to find our division. We slept with horses saddled as we never knew when we would have to get a move on What a thirst we all had. It must have been well on towards daybreak before we camped & at daybreak we rode back to Beersheba to try again for water. The Engineers were busy on the water supply. Most of the wells we heard had been mined. After many hours we were successful and returned back to camp & moved on. Beersheba is connected by railway & the rolling stock had all been mined. Souvenirs were plentiful but anything of a weighty character could not be carried\n\nWe got into touch & were told to proceed to a place called Tel El Sheria which we did. Going along the track there were dead & wounded about & we did what we could. We met a few who had lost touch of their units & were on the same lay as ourselves. After wandering about we decided to camp & our S.M. proceeded to try & get in touch with Headquarters. Failing in this we pushed on & intended to strike Tel El Sheria as quickly as possible. We very nearly met with disaster. Tel El Sheria had not fallen and we would have probably rode into the Turkish lines. This would have meant capture or practically the total destruction\n\nof our small party. On our arrival at Tel El Sheria which was at night we were too tired & worn out to do anything but unsaddle roll up in blanket & go to sleep. Next morning on waking we found we were sleeping in a Turkish Ordnance dump where some English Infantry had had a bad time in taking. The gully was full of dead horses camels & men & we had been sleeping among them. The stench was not very bad as the bodies had not started to decompose. People in Ausy have no idea what it means to see men meet death often in its most violent form away in a country away from civilisation. It makes one think\n","282":"\n\nToday we were sent out foraging for tucker for ourselves & horses. We are down to Biscuits only. S.M. went over to railway to try & get in touch with Headquarters. Wally Evans & I found a redoubt and on going inside we fell over a wire. We thought it was all up & fully believed it was mined. However nothing happened and after clearing some of the Turks out we came across a fine lot of grain. We found a few live Turks hiding here. Turks in small parties were wandering about wanting to be captured as they had no food.\n","283":"\n\nThe bridge across the Gully had been mined & blown up by Jacko before leaving thus rendering railway useless.\n","284":"\n\nDust storm today Attended wounded & cleaned up our camping ground\n","285":"\n\nFour of us spent day foraging for horse feed & food. The Turk left a complete Bakery, Ordnance & Field Hospital in his hurried retreat. We found a number of wounded Turks in the Hospital & some of the Gun positions. We came across Medical supplies & in a store near to the station a quantity of onions & wheat\n\nA good find with rations so low\n","286":"\n","287":"\n\nBedouin Tribe came hanging round today. Buzzed them off. Found Capt Travers an English officer dead & stripped. What dogs these Bedouins are.\n","288":"\n","289":"\n\nAbundance of dogs here. Flies so bad during day that it is impossible to eat. Stench from dead bodies of animals unbearable. Salvage corps busy burying dead. Tom bad with septic sores. Cannot at present locate division\n","290":"\n\nHave been down three days Dysentry. We moved today to Huj. Owing\n\nto no hospital being handy. I had to ride with the rest of the Boys. I suffered the tortures of Hell. On our ride to Huj we passed large quantities of abandoned stores. Arrived at Huj but found Division had moved but a few hours. We were just about done & as rations were low our SM. decided to strike across Country to Gaza for rations & to find whereabouts of Division.\n","291":"\n\nRode to Gaza. On way across had an argument with Bedouins. Arrived at Gaza dusk & secured good supply of Bully Beef & Biscuits from an Officer of Egyptian Labour Corp.\n\nOur trip across Gaza we saw our first sign of grass. On our way one saw the recently occupied positions of the Turks & there were plenty of bombs left about for the unwary to be caught. A favourite method of Jacko is to leave a bomb in a heap of straw or among Horse feed . I turned my old Neddy out on the grass & faithful fellow that he is, he was so hungry that he could not eat fast enough. We are all tired out & simply lay on the ground and went fast asleep in a few minutes.\n","292":"\n\nHeard Division at Ramleh. Moving up there tonight.\n\nHad a look round Gaza today. The town which we had to make three costly attempts before it fell. It is nothing but a mass of ruins the result of the constant shelling by monitors off the coast & our heavy artillery. The Minaret which the Artillery spared on account of it being a place of worship by the Mohammedans was found to have been used for observation purposes. A large shell we found was lying at the foot of the Altar & unfortunately failed to explode. Had it exploded it would have blown the Minaret to \n\n-. There was hardly one building, House or Hovel which had not been \n\nhit. Many bombs & traps were laid before Jacko surrendered. About dusk we moved from \nJil\n Gaza bound for Julius.\n","293":"\n\nWe rode all through last night & arrived at Julius just before daybreak Julius is usual type of native village consisting of one or two decent houses where the head men of the village lived the rest being hovels.\n\nWe are now getting into decent country & Oranges are plentiful. Rain fell this morning & continued all day. As we were without shelter we were soon soaked\n","294":"\n\nRain continued & we slept or tried to in the mud. We\n\nmoved on towards Railhead Half way along road we were told it was a short cut across country. We took it & arrived in Ramley about 3 pm. Our horses are showing themselves weary owing to the rough time they have had Ramley seems rather a large place & on first impression strikes one rather forcibly with its white buildings. Such a contrast to the hovels we have passed. It is connected by Railway and is surrounded by Orange Groves & Orchards.\n","295":"\n\nAt last we have caught up with Division & moving out to Jaffa this afternoon.\n\nMoving again. It seems recently we have wandered all over Palestine & I feel I could sleep for a week. Our way from Ramleh lay along a good road through very pretty country. The green orchards & red tiled houses was a revelation to us after such a spell in the desert. It reminded me very much of the Northern line of N.S.W. Before reaching Jaffa we rode right into a scrap at Dieran and did some first aid among the Boys. We entered Jaffa about four in the afternoon with the New Zealanders. Our small section had the honour of being the first Ausys to enter Jaffa. Turks hidden in the houses of Jaffa & the boys busy rooting them out\n","296":"\n\nJaffa fine town & the largest I have seen in Palestine. It has one main street. Large Town Hall, Gardens, Band Stand & the outlying portions of Jaffa is very pretty.\n\n The Convent here is a very fine large airy building built of stone. The French civilian hospital is also a massive place. Germans principally occupied the best houses & one on going into the Town can easily realise what a hold Turkish capital had here. We pitched our camp on some beautiful white sand situated handy to the Surf & Town. Hope we have a decent spell here\n","297":"\n\nOur way to water lays about 3 miles down a red road with Wattle & Gum Trees plentiful. I never expected to see this out of Australia. The Turks are shelling particularly the water so there is still plenty of excitement.\n","298":"\n\nTown is well occupied with Hebrews & Bedouin & swarms of Hebrews are returning with their Donkeys laden with all manner of goods. Some of the shops are reopening & the Jew is out to do business in Souvenirs & take you down if you stand it. Jacko shelling. Auckland Reg suffered heavily taking this place\n","299":"\n\nAll troops when on leave in Towns to be armed. Numerous spies still about. Several have been caught signalling & directing enemy Artillery from roofs of houses. Air raid through night.\n","300":"\n\nJacko bombed Jaffa today No Anti Air Craft guns here yet. Jacko knew this & flew low. He bombed the town systematically killing Jews & Bedouins & by some strange coincidence did not get one soldier although the Town was full. Jaffa is situated on the coast of the Mediterranean & built right down to the Waters edge. It has a fine beach for surfing\n\n& during the few days we have been here we have been busy swimming the Horses\n","301":"\n\nWorking on water supply at Jaffa civilian hospital. Bombed again today. Jaffa particularly its outskirts is a pretty place with its red tiled houses, & Orange Groves.\n\nJacko received a surprise to day, Anti Air craft guns were brought up during the \nday\n night\n","302":"\n\nSent to Ramley to day, road quiet until within 3 miles of Ramley where road was under shellfire. Got through safely\n\n \n","303":"\n\nReturned to Jaffa Found the boys standing to owing to Jacko shelling Some spies were caught signalling & directing artillery fire from housetops. Taubes came over at night\n","304":"\n\nVisited Jaffa & visited ruins near the shore. Saw remains of House where Simon Peter supposed to have stayed\n","305":"\n\nLooking like rain today\n\nReceived some parcels. Anzac Divisional \nPost Cards\n Christmas Cards came along today. Posted some to friends. In afternoon visited foundry\n","306":"\n\nRaining today. My old Neddy looks picture of health owing to good spell & ample rations.\n","307":"\n\nMoving back to Richon Le Zion tomorrow for good spell out of line.\n","308":"\n\nSent on advance guard Reported Col Cave 1ST LH.FA. Heavy rain & set in & spent miserable night in rain.\n","309":"\n\nStill raining heavily. The rainy season has started in Palestine & we understand it is on the cards we will be here until after Christmas. Saw Camel Corp & some of my old pals trekking back to Raffa\n\nfor a spell. The camels have the mange & most of the boys badly need a spell so they are to be isolated\n","310":"\n\nMud everywhere, raining heavily. Unit arrived today wet through.\n","311":"\n\nCamped in open. Rain & mud , everything in a hell of a mess.\n","312":"\n\nBeautiful fine day so we proceeded to make camp. We secured a lovely position on a slope among some good old saplings. The village lies some 560 yds at the back of us and it looks very pretty sheltered among the trees.\n","313":"\n\nTaubes came over today observing & we saw a very fine air duel unfortunately no machines were brought down.\n","314":"\n\nTaubes raided Ramley to day. Ramley with its tall spire & tower of the forty martyrs looks beautiful\n\nMust visit Ramley at first opportunity. Rechon is a quiet country village. Its principal products seem to be the wine industry, nuts & oranges.\n\nSome of the Orange groves are irrigated to perfection. One being camped here could easily forget that there was any War. The occasional visits of the Taubes however keep us \n\nreminded. We went to Jaffa & bought two small pigs today in hopes that we will be here for Christmas. Many of the Jewish children had never seen pigs and they were a source of amusement to the children. How pleased the Kiddies seem to be that we are here. Our immobile section coming up. We lost 20% of our strength last stint\n","315":"\n\nBeautiful sunny day. Spent day grazing my Horse & cleaning & repairing saddle. Referendum notices posted up. Presentation of Medals in Village today. Population village estimated 600.\n","316":"\n\nVoted on Referendum question\n\nRain coming up again. However we are more prepared for it this time\n","317":"\n\nBitterly cold & windy to day Wrote mail\n","318":"\n\nFirst Brigade moved up into Trenches to relieve New Zealanders Fine again today.\n","319":"\n\nRode into Esdud to day to bring some of our boys back. Esdud now a big dump & railway station. All speed being made to bring up Railway as quickly as possible\n\nRaining heavily again. Signallers below us flooded out. The Arabic name for Richon is Ayn Khua\n","320":"\n\nStill raining had to move horses Rode to Canteen for Christmas supplies\n","321":"\n\nSaw Squadron of our planes flie over today laden with pills for the Turks.\n","322":"\n\nOn half rations & roads impassable on account of heavy rains which is also destroying Railway\n","323":"\n\nProspect for fine Christmas very poor. Cold, wet, miserable\n\nday\n","324":"\n\nPreparing for Christmas dinner. Wet to day\n","325":"\n\nChristmas day Wet & Cold. In morning we went to church service in a huge wine cellar. The service was conducted by Padre Waddy. After the service all hands could get as much wine as they wished. As usual several abused the privilege & made fools of themselves. Our Christmas dinner was a success. What odds if we did get wet eating it. The toast of the day Absent Friends & may we all be home Christmas 1918. Word came through the division would \n\nmove to morrow\n","326":"\n\nIt was raining & cold & the roads were in an awful state. We were bogged several times crossing a flat near Yebnah. Yebnah is the usual type of filthy village. Our Horses were absolutely bogged at times & there was nothing else for it but to get off & sink in the mud ourselves. A few Horses were drowned . The Artillery we passed seemed to be hopelessly bogged in the mud. We arrived at Ezdud just on dark and what it a mess it was. It was under water A train there was practically marooned. The dump was\n\nunder water and we had the pleasure of seeing our precious mail just arrived floating all over the shop. Here a number of Camels, native Drivers & English troops died of exposure. We made our way to the Sandhills & arrived absolutely exausted. Thus we spent Boxing day 1917.\n","327":"\n\nBitterly cold today.\n\nHave heavy cold & cannot speak. We straightened up camp.\n","328":"\n\nweather clearing up, spelling.\n","329":"\n\nReceived some mail, wet but readable.\n","330":"\n\nOn water guard Ezdud.\n\nis supposed to be one of the oldest villages in Palestine. It was here that there was once a 7 yrs siege. There is nothing to remind one now of its importance for it is a evil smelling filthy place & the inhabitants look as though they are degenerating. \n","331":"\n\nThere was no excitement. The old year passed quietly away. Most thoughts I think were wondering if the coming year would bring the war to a close.\n\n1918\n","332":"\n\nRaining again. The dump & Railway is just about a mass of sand.\n","333":"\n\nVisited ruins of Esdud to day. This place was at one time occupied by Philistines. Was besieged so the story goes for 27 yrs before it fell. Out of Camel Train which left here yesterday for Richon a distance of 10 miles only 120 arrived.\n","334":"\n\nUsual routine, Raining like hell.\n","335":"\n\nStill raining\n","336":"\n\nHeard Conscription failed.

The dump at Kantara since last I saw it has altered wonderfully. It now employs an army of men principally B class. Had dinner at Chisholms shower, shave & caught Egyptian mail to Cairo 1-20 arriving Cairo at 5 pm. The country all down looked in first class order. One could see the natives with the old style plough. The wells where\n\nthe water was drawn & the old style threshing. On arrival at Cairo I went round to Anzac Hostel & to bed. The first sleep in a decent bed for some months\n","343":"\n\nMorning Took Tram to Abbasia where General Hospital is situated.

Our way lie through Rambi which is now a large dump, second to Ludd About three miles from Rambi we halted for forty minutes for lunch. Then moving on to Latron where we camped\n\nOur halt for lunch was situated about one mile from a small village called El Kubat. We arrived at Latron which is situated at foot of Judean hill about 4 pm. Some 15 miles Jerusalem.\n","400":"\n\nAnzac div left Latron 7.30 AM for Jerusalem. We started to climb Judean Hills Country is very mountainous & barren. Passed through Kuryet El Enab or village of Grapes. French had possession of this place in pre war days. Beautiful stone church to be seen here. I noticed Bedouin Men, Women & Children working on roads. Oranges are scarce up here. The road is a good road but the side track we took was\n\nvery rough. It was impossible to ride in places. Passed many small villages en route and saw some very fine panoramic views. Included among these were Rambi with its spire. The coast in the distance. There were also some fine positions commanding the roads which had been held by the Turks. One seeing this country would think these positions impregnable. We passed the house where John the Baptist was born and entered Jerusalem about 4 pm. Passing through Jerusalem we camped on Mt of Olives some three miles from Town.\n\nWe were tired out & had just pitched our Bivvys when we were ordered to move to\n\nanother site in Jerusalem. Arrived there about 8 pm and slept in open. It rained during night and in morning all hands were drenched.\n","401":" \n\nFoggy morning. Seems like home to hear the clocks striking the hour church bells ringing. Left for sightseeing 9 AM. Riding along road we passed English Cathedral a massive stone building, the German Hospital Damascus & Jaffa Gate. These gates with others are the entrance into old Jerusalem. They are a tremendous height about 90ft. foundation\nto\n of Jerusalem wall supposed to be 40 to 50 ft depth & walls 40 ft high. We rode round the outside \n\nof the walls. Having a fine view of the valley of the Kings. We were told that the track we rode round consisted of rubbish as it was the custom in the old days to through all the rubbish over the walls more particularly when in a state of siege. The walls were we were told were 20 to 30 ft higher in the old days. The rubbish however has gradually built up so the walls are higher on the inside than on the outside. We then rode out to the Mt of Olives when it started raining We kept going to the Town of Ascension. This is the spot where Jesus was supposed to have ascended into Heaven It is a church having a tall spire\n\n \n\nsome 150 ft high & from here you can see the country for miles. \n\nWe saw Virgins well. Palace where Kaiser stayed on visit to Jerusalem now occupied by our G.O.C. We visited Garden of Gethsemane a small but very historical spot. In here they have small figures representing Christ & his Disciples We rode round narrow track & looking down into the valley saw Roman Church with its five gold capped Domes also Tombs of the Kings & the road winding towards Jericho. We returned back to camp through Jerusalem & in afternoon visited inside the walls on foot. I saw the Mosque of Omar also known as the Dome of the Rock. The dome of the\n\nrock was built AD 918 & occupies former site of Temple of Solomon. It is a fine piece of architecture Within the building are three concentric colonnades with columns of polished marble. Then comes the central hall over the rock, the hall is circular and is surrounded by columns of polished marble. Built above these is a dome The dome externally is covered with brass plates, gilt, while the building itself its floors & its walls and the drum are ornamented with marble & mosaics. From here we went & stood on the old Battlements & had a good view of surrounding country. From here we crossed the courtyard with its old Roman Pillars still standing. \n\nWe then visited the wailing stone. This presents a wonderful sight. An enormous wall against which the Jews wail & pray hammering a nail in between the crevices of the wall. From here we went through some of the streets. They were so narrow that one from upstairs could easily shake hands with person on opposite side. We saw one or two other Mosques & entered the Holy Sepulcre. The church of the Holy Sepulcre is the modern representative of Churches erected in the Emperor Constantine in AD 325 – 6 in honour of the places which were believed to have been the respective scenes of the Crucifixion & Resurrection of Christ. The chapel stands on a \n\nplatform a little above the floor. The entrance is by a low archway. Inside a narrow passage leads to the top. In the chapel of the Angels 15 lamps are always burning & in the centre is a fragment of stone that closed the mouth of the Sepulcre. The tomb is a marble bench while above are 43 lamps the three Communitys owning 13 each & the Copts 4.\n\nSaw Crusaders grave at entrance also service in church.\n\nReturned back to camp after having spent the most interesting day since I left Ausy.\n","402":"\n\nStill raining We were washed out of camp last night. Took refuge in Jews house & stabled Horses.

Good grazing for horses & just in this spot Partridges, quails & wild flowers plentiful. Tribesmen here strip wounded & dead. Saw cases my own eyes Jacko retiring.\n","413":"\n\nFine warm day. It is said White man cannot live in this valley in summer time owing to heat & valley being 1200 ft below Sea level. Jordan River flows from Sea of Gallilee to Dead Sea. Have seen Dead Sea. Water so salt that one cant sink in it. Bringing in Wounded. Moved to another position on Main road at dusk and camped at place called Shunet Nimron\n\nThursday March 28\n\nJacko bombed to day at daybreak. Gave us hell. Casualties coming in fairly heavy Transport cannot get along owing to only one road and that in bad condition owing to rain. Capt Sutton & seven of us moving out to night to advanced dressing station. Bombed again just as we were saddling up 18 Taubes. Did a fair amount of damage. No Anti Air craft guns here so Jacko had it all his own way Moved out at 5.30 & moved to main road towards Esault After going up road for about ¼ mile we turned on to a Goat track. Several times we were compelled to dismount & walk owing to the roughness of the Country \n\nWe crossed a Wadi I believe it was near Ain Sin. About every 3 miles we passed a patrol Only for these patrols I think we would have been hopelessly lost. Just on daybreak we located advanced dressing station of 2ND LHFA unit. The Casualties were heavy owing to no Artillery.\n","414":" Good","415":"\n\nWe were exceptionally busy all day. Stretcher bearing, bringing in wounded & despatching them back to next station. There was heavy fighting all day the New Zealand Brigade particularly Auckland Reg suffering severely Our position I believe is known as Birket \n\nEl Enab. It was raining heavily & bitterly cold all day. By midday our few tents were full of wounded & the rain pouring through. We found three large Caves & had to use these accommodating about 200. All Waggons, Camels & horses which came our way were commandeered to carry wounded to Jericho some 15 miles. A party of slightly wounded set out on foot. We have no rations & things are in a deplorable condition.\n","416":" Still raining & cold. Busy bringing in attending wounded. None of us have had any sleep since leaving Shunet Nimron Messenger\n\narrived from Headquarters to tell us to get out at Daybreak Impossible as there is 250 wounded to get away. \n","417":"\n\nStill raining & very cold\n\nArtillery cannot get up owing state of roads. Our boys evacuating positions Camel Field Amb arrived to help get wounded away","418":" Division evacuated midday. We got away at dark after 2ND Brigade & all troops retired Chances of getting out were not too bright. It was very dark so much so that you could not see a foot in front of you. The Camels with medical supplies kept falling in the soft going\n\n& several of these we had to leave. We rode all night through mud & water & at day break Monday came across a patrol.\n\nMonday April 1\n\nThe Turks at this time were practically on us in large numbers & it was only the darkness which pulled us through. 3 of our boys were caught through going back for some gear.\n\nWe rode on till we reach Esault situated half way in the hills of Moab & had breakfast Bully & Biscuit & pushed on for Shunet Nimron arriving about 2 pm. We were so worn out that we slept all afternoon & night without waking\n","419":"\n\nTurks are concentrating & another scrap is expected. The Armoured Cars have gone up to Esault to hold the road. We crossed the Jordan again today & took up again our old positions. Coming along the road it was pitiable to see the Women & Children trying to get back to our line, knowing that the Turks would Massacre them. We were bombed crossing the River & finally camped near Mt of Temptation on Jericho flat. Worst stunt I was ever in & in my opinion we received a hiding this time.\n","420":"\n\nJacko bombed at dawn all\n\nhands except pickets in bed. Soon got out of bed. Killed a number of horses & wounded & killed Troops. The Turk is trying to put the wind up us and we are at present having a very rough spin.\n","421":"\n\n1ST L. horse captured Turkish patrol last night 1ST Brigade digging trenches just over Jordan. Both sides shelling heavily. All hands ordered to dig in.\n","422":"\n\nThe weather is exceptionally hot here & flies very bad.\n\nA number of the lads are getting sick. All Details I am told are coming down from Jerusalem. It will make things easier for we are very much under strength.\n","423":"\n\nVisited Greek Monastry near camp today. It is built on Mt Forty also Mt Temptation next to it. This monastry is built in the face of the cliff of stone & inhabited by a few monks. Practically a impregnable position\n","424":"\n\nAn absolute roaster to day Temp 120 degrees had to go across River on message While over, Jacko started leaving some coal boxes. Was night before I could get back.\n","425":"\n\nThe Jordan Valley is some 14 miles across from one range of hills to the other. On one side the hills of Moab on the other the Judean hills. The Jordan River practically flows down the Centre.\n","426":"\n\nButler evacuated Hospital Davidson taking his place. Posted parcel home I received from Jerusalem to day. The horses here feel the heat as well as us. What a boon it is to have a decent Horse. Very hot & dusty. Jacko shelling.\n","427":"\n\nLost one of our St. Sgt to day. If things go on like this there\n\nwill soon be nobody left\n","428":"\n\nTurks made an attack to day across Flat. They advanced in close formation & we waited until they were practically up to wire before fire. The Artillery let fly putting a barrage at back of them preventing them from getting away. They were machine Gunned in front & shelled from behind & were repulsed with very heavy losses.\n","429":"\n\nAnother Bomb raid this morning. Turks have retired back into the Hills of Moab after their bad mauling yesterday. It is hot here\n","430":"\n\nSent to NCOs school at Moascar. Good news will now have decent spell. We journeyed to Jerusalem by motor lorry. Steep grade all the way. Much cooler in Jerusalem. Stayed night at Jerusalem\n","431":"\n\nLeft Jerusalem by Railway small gage for Ludd also known as Railhead. The Journey was down hill all the way to Ludd. There we had Tea & changed Trains to open truck and broad gage for Kantara.\n","432":"\n\nArrived Kantara 11AM crossed canal & caught Egyptian mail after lunch for Moascar. Arrived there about 3 P.M.

C. Speering D Harold & myself going together. The school has been a pleasant break from the Field but became very monotonous towards the finish I hope this will be my last school\n","447":"\n\nHot day did not go out.\n\nWrote Mail.\n","448":"\n\nLeft for Alexandria by 9.30AM train from Moascar. It is now harvesting season & the natives\n\nare busy in carrying in their crops.\n\nSome of the places particularly the Railway Stations were gaily decorated with flags in honour of the Sultan’s visit. We saw the Natives irrigating the crops & chopping the Tibbin. Arrived Alexandria 3 pm. Put up Windsor Hotel. Visited Noriza Gardens & had a run around Town. Alexandria seems a nice city much nicer than Cairo. The streets however are so narrow. Returned back to hotel & once again slept on a soft bed.\n","449":"\n\nAlexandria strikes me as being more of a Cosmopolitan City than Cairo. There are all Nationalities here & most seem prosperous\n\nWe roamed round town most of the day enjoying ourselves by looking at the shops & buying some Souvenirs. In the evening visited Theatre.\n","450":"\n\nWent out to City Bish & St Stephens in double decker tram. The suburbs of Alexandria are very pretty & we saw some fine gardens. Would not mind spending a few months here. We passed the Racecourse & Casino. Evening we all had a night out. The trams of Alexandria are similar to those in Cairo. Small & uncomfortable. French Gardens very pretty\n","451":"\n\nVisited Catacombs, Dissapointed in same. Caught 2 pm Train from Alexandria back to Moascar\n\nArrived Moascar 7pm when I received \n\nmail My trip to Alexandria was very enjoyable though hardly long enough. My impressions were favourable & I prefer Alexandria to Cairo. One see practically every Nationalitie in Alex & Cairo. The morality of Alex seems just about on a par with Cairo, pretty low\n\nFriday \nJune\n","452":"\n\nInoculated this morning Left Moascar 1pm Very hot day, sandstorms crossing desert.\nin open\n Very unpleasant travelling in open truck.\n","453":"\n\nArrived at Ludd early this morning where we had to change trains for Jerusalem. Arrived at Jerusalem 7pm. On our journey which was a steep grade all way we passed\n\nmany villages & small farms. At several places we saw the stone Terraces so common to the country round here\n","454":"\n\nHeard Germans had advanced 15 miles on French front. Heard unit were at present camping at Bethlehem Struck camp about 11 AM\n","455":"\n\nIt \nwas a\n has been a beautiful day to day. Fine , sunny & cool. We are at present engaged in oiling the wells round here to prevent the breeding of the Malaria Mosquito. There are some massive stone buildings in Bethlehem. Personally I like Bethlehem in preference to Jerusalem\n\nThe people seem superior to average Jerusalem people. We are camped among Olive trees and amid good surroundings. The weather is cool and at present we are having a good spell.\n","456":"\n\nThis morning we were oiling wells & in afternoon examined Aquaduct which brings supply of water from Solomon’s wells to Bethlehem.\n","457":"\n\nvisited Bethlehem today. Very much struck with this place will write my impressions later.\n","458":"\n\nWent out to N.Z. Brigade Field Amb. Temporalily attached. Camp situated at Solomon’s pools about half way between Hebron & Bethlehem. These pools are there in number of considerable depth & size. At present they contain water so we are in a handy position as regards watering. There are snakes in these pools & in vicinity. Solomons gardens all that is left of them lie a little lower down from the pools.\n","459":"\n\n2ND Brigade came in to day from the valley looking absolute wrecks. Heard we will be moving in few days\n","460":" \n\nLovely day again. Rode into Bethlehem to see some of the boys. Mail arrived.\n","461":"\n\nRode out towards Hebron on message to Wellington & Canterbury Regs. Very windy day. Good news arrived from French front\n","462":" \n\nLooking like rain today. Rode out to Hebron. Usual type of Palestine City.\n","463":"\n\nFresh issue steel helmets issued to day Received mail & papers from home. We were inspected today by Gen Clayton. This means an early move I suppose.\n","464":"\n\nHeard rumour to day that our division may be going to France. Causing mild excitement.\n","465":"\n\nSaw Monastry built on old site of Solomons gardens. Parts of the old garden still intact. Moved out from Solomon’s Pools to Telat El Doon at 5pm. Sorry to leave this camp. Passed through Jerusalem about 10pm arrived Telat el Doon 7 AM. Friday Very tiring trip with Camels\n","466":"\n\nScorcher today 4th Brigade came up from Jordan Valley 125 % degrees to day & no shade. Fine choking dust flying owing to constant stream of horses watering Telat El Doon also known \n\nas the hills of Blood is situated half way between Jerusalem & Jericho. A more desolate place it would be hard to imagine. There is no sign of vegetation Just the barren hills on each side. The heat at this place is terrific. Perhaps it is because it is situated in a natural pocket.\n","467":"\n\nAbout 7 pm we saddle up & moved towards Jericho It was a moonlight night but not a breath of air. We arrived in the valley about 2 AM & camped at the foot of Mt Temptation just beside a small running stream which I think was a small tributary\n\nof the Wadi Kelt\n","468":"\n\nJacko over at daybreak this morning Very nearly lost my neddy to day during shelling. Auckland Reg went into Trenches last night. Moving into position to night \n\nVery Hot day\n","469":"\n\nSent out on message to Auckland Reg. Had great difficulty finding them. Very nearly rode into Turkish Lines. On arrival back at Camp Found the boys moving up to their old position.\n","470":"\n\nWrote mail, getting very hot here Several of the boys evacuated with Malaria. Jacko\n\nover again. Scorpions bad here also snakes. Fortunately we are at present camped near water thus having the opportunity of a shower & bath.","471":"\n\nTurks shelled today. Badly hit Jericho. From our camp can be seen the hills of Moab where the Turks have a strong position. In these hills the big gun known as Jericho Jane is situated.\n","472":"\n\nHeat very bad. Turks concentrating near River Jordan. With the exception of Artillery fire the front has of late been very quiet. Heard first class lecture on Malaria.\n","473":"\n\nThe Fireflies in certain parts of the Jordan Valley are brilliant at night. Today we rode over to the Dead Sea through Jericho. Jericho is now practically a mass of ruins. The famous City of olden times lies buried. Its population consists approximately of about 200 all told and of these 200 there are few which are up to the ordinary standard of the Native. We rode through Jericho & started for the Dead Sea. We failed to reach it owing to the Turks Artillery. This Flat is undoubtedly the wilderness so often mentioned in the Bible.\n\nThe white dust is now up to \n\nthe Horses knees through the constant passage of waggons. The dust gets in everything & is most unpleasant.\n","474":"\n\nWent over to 1ST FA today Just as Tom & I landed there Jericho Jane dropped one in the camp & we had to get down for our lives. We were in a funk hole for nearly two hours while Jacko heaved them all round the camp. Killed several horses.\n","475":"\n\nJacko shelled us again to day. The weather here is \nbringing\n responsible for a number of us having a heat rash & Septic Sores. There is very \n\nlittle chance of getting them better while we are here\n","476":"\n\nScorpions in the valley are very numerous. Several of the lads have been bitten. Snakes are also fairly plentiful. It is practically middle of Summer here & the average Temp is anything about 120 ° .Here they were told it was impossible for White men to live in the summer. However here we are & from all appearances likely to remain.\n\nMonday\n","477":"\n\nSame old routine today. Last night the Artillery had a fly\n\nand there seemed to be something doing. However we were hauled out to stand too but nothing came of it.\n\nTuesday\n","478":"\n\nWe were told today that Jericho Jane the big gun which was giving us so much trouble had been located & destroyed. Four heavy howitzers supposed to be coming up here to night. Turks gave Auckland Reg bad shelling this afternoon.\n","479":"\n\nAnother scorcher. More shells stood to Horses on side of hill for over two hours. He cleared up part of our Division. Wellington \n\nBrigade Tran, Headquarters & Vets lost Horses. Very few other casualties. Towards evening we had to stand to again\n","480":"\n\nVery hot to day. All hands busy burying horses which Jacko killed yesterday.\n","481":"\n\nWe had a spell to day as there was not a shot fired on either side. Rumours of a stunt coming off. If we stay here much longer we will have no men. Reported Jacko shelling Jerusalem dump with heavy range gun. In my opinion it is going to be a\n\ntough job getting Jacko out of the hills. It is such a natural defensive position & he has had plenty of time to prepare his defences\n","482":"\n\nArtillery fire heavy through night. Usually in the middle of the day in the Jordan valley there is not a sign of life. It is too hot for anything. The flies would drive one mad & every night one needs to make an inspection of his bivvy for scorpions etc. The life here is one long monotony. We would welcome anything for a change\n","483":"\n\nJacko gave 1ST Brigade who are down near bridgehead a fairly lively time to day. The Batterys\n\nInverness, Ayreshire & Somerset which are in a good possy by Bridgehead\n","484":"\n\nHeavy Artillery Action just at dawn I was told that Medical Officers estimated we would lose 50 % of our strength down here through Malaria. Most of us are pictures with septic sores & heat rash.\n\nReceived parcels & mail.\n","485":"\n\nTaubes over today. They received a rough spin from our planes. The sickness is becoming alarming. Those who are left are pretty well washed out. Of an evening just after sunset we can easily distinguish the fires in the Turkish lines. How we wish we were in that position.\n\namong the hills where it must be cooler. Cannot understand why the Turks do not mass their artillery among the hills & give us a much rougher spin. They evidently must be short of artillery for they were never in a better position than they are in now in my opinion since I have been here.\n","486":"\n\nMalaria & Dysentry increasing All the Wadis being oiled to prevent breeding of mosquitos. Canalisation is also being undertaken by large bodies of Indians.\n","487":"\n\nUsual routine Things quiet to day \n","488":"\n\nUsual routine\n","489":"\n\nVery windy clouds of dust in valley. Turks shelling today.\n","490":"\n","491":"\n\nDuring the last week there has been nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nJacko has been shelling at various times and the weather has been exceptionally hot. The boys are just about fed up with this place & would welcome anything for a change. Last night we had a bomb raid just about sunset &\n\nthere was heavy Artillery fire during the night. We had been standing to since daybreak as a stunt was expected.\n","492":"\n\nStill shelling on both sides.\n\nThe Division secured 500 prisoners principally Germans. The Germans with Turkish Troops attacked just after dawn. Two first Brigade outposts were captured. The fighting continued practically all day and the last posts were recaptured by counter attack. To give an example of how fond the Turks are of the Germans. On this occasion so prisoners tell us the Germans were to be used as storm troops backed up by the Turks. Everything went all\n\nright for a while. When the Boys began to hold their own, The Turks turned & fired on some of the Germans. German prisoners captured expressed their feelings pretty forcibly as to Jacko’s treatment. A number of prisoners were knocked out through want of water. A day in the Jordan Valley with its heat & dust is bad enough for anything without running short of water. What looked like a serious affair for us turned out as the day wore on to be a complete victory\n","493":"\n\nLas night was a busy night for most of us getting the wounded & sick troops through to the clearing station at Jericho.\n\nThe road was bad & blocked \n\n \n\nby heavy traffic. When the moon went down the fun started.\n\nWe became tangled in the barb wire & had great difficulty getting out. The Australian Div who were at Telat El Doon came down by forced march to reinforce Anzac Division if necessary. Fortunately it was all over before they arrived. The number of prisoners taken in this small scrap amounted to about 1500. Things are quiet tonight.\n","494":"\n\nTaube over observing this morning. 1ST Brigade shelled at Water parade this morning. Lost number of Horses & 21 Casualties.\n","495":" \n\nAnother scorcher today. Moving\n\nout tomorrow night for spell. Everything quiet. Australian Division relieving us in this sector\n","496":"\n\nBusy preparing to move. Moved out about 7 pm. Arrived at Telat El Doon about 11 pm.\n\nUp hill travelling all the way\n","497":"\n\nStaying a couple of days here. Water shortage for horses. Had to ride nearly to Jericho for water.\n","498":"\n\nThe last few days there has nothing doing. We are simply waiting movement orders to proceed to our next camp.\n","499":"\n\nReceived wire to report to 1ST LH. F. Amb. Proceeding to Richon. Saddled up & left Telat EL Doon about 4 pm. Passed through Bethany about 7 pm Jerusalem 9 pm & struck","500":" Brigade camping at the village of Enab situated some 5 miles out of Jerusalem\n","501":" Enab is the usual type of Bedouin village. Very dirty camp site owing to number of Troops camping on their way to & from the valley. It is usually only used for one night. We are leaving here for Latron at 7 pm tonight\n","502":"\n\nLeft Enab 7 pm last night. It was a beautiful moonlight night and the road was clear. The journey only occupied four hours to the foothills as the travelling was all down hill & the road in good order. We are moving tonight to Wadi El Neins near Richon.\n","503":"\n\nWe moved last night about 7 pm. It was a beautiful night. We arrived at our old camp site which I had not seen since March. just on daybreak, Today I put up my bivvy and am looking forward to a good spell here.\n","504":"\n\nGrapes & Melons are plentiful just at present. The fruit is very welcome after our long spell in the Jordan valley.\n","505":"\n\nRode to Jaffa today. Jaffa much altered since I was last there. The town has developed & business is in full swing. We had a dip in the surf also giving our horses a swim.\n","506":"\n\nTook a trip to Richon to day. One of the prettiest little villages I have seen. The Jews seem well contented & prosperous. \n\n \n","507":"\n\nThere is not much news to be written. Since we came here we have had very little to do.\n\nThere are all sorts of rumours current as to our future movements. We have spent the time quietly having occasional sports, concerts.\n\nThe spell here has done us all good including the Horses. There are rumours of a big offensive early next month. Tomorrow we are moving to Latron\n","508":"\n\nLeft for Latron at 7 AM. On our way passed camp of the Artillery belonging to Australian Division. Arrived at Latron at the foot of the Jordan\n\nhills about 4 pm. Camping here to night. Moving on again tomorrow morning.\n","509":"\n\nLeft Latron 9 AM proceeded through the Jordan Hills to Jerusalem. We arrived at Enab about 2 pm & camped here.\n","510":"\n\nStaying here until tomorrow. Horses & men in good condition.\n\nNothing doing to day\n","511":"\n\nMoved from here 2 pm for Jerusalem. We arrived on outskirts of Jerusalem about 5 pm & halted 1 hr for Tea. It was cold on the hills. After Tea we moved out passing through Jerusalem\n\nabout 8 pm. The inhabitants were watching us from their houses & shops. I am convinced there are plenty of spies in Jerusalem. Passing through Jerusalem we took the Jericho road & arrived at Bethany about 10 pm. There we halted for a few hours. \n","512":"\n\nMoved about 3 AM. It was pitch dark & cold. The division resumed its journey towards Jericho arriving at Telat El Doon about 9 AM. We are staying here until tomorrow.\n","513":"\n\nWe left Telat EL Doon at 5 AM.\n\narriving at foothills in afternoon where we camped preparatory to taking up position in the line. Taubes visited us & we were also shelled while watering. Once more we are back in the old Jordan Valley. Where we are there is no shelter so expect Jacko will give us hell\n\nThursday Aug 22\n\nContrary to expectations things were quiet to day & about 8 pm we took over from 3RD LH.FA The position we are at present occupying is one of the worst in the valley. We are some 3 miles from Water camped between two hills. Going to water is like taking a ticket\n\nin Tatts. You maybe lucky or otherwise The Turks are constantly trying to shell the watering area. To get to water you are compelled to cross open country Thus the excitement.\n\nThe 1ST Reg are camped at Mersalarba. 2ND Reg in between two hills to the left &","514":" reg with Headquarters behind the hills. Machine Gunners are down in the Wadi bed which is quite dry & not a bad possy. The sick & wounded unless urgent are brought in by night & one needs to be very careful as direction is easily misjudged.\n","515":"\n\nThe weather is exceptionally hot & one feels fit for nothing here. Things are quiet but it is rumoured an attack is expected at any time.\n","516":"\n\nJacko shelling to day\n\nEverything ready for expected attack.\n","517":"\n\nWent out in Sand Cart to","518":" Reg. to day. We had great difficulty finding them owing to number of attacks.\n","519":"\n\nUsual routine to day. Weather still very hot\n","520":"\n\nThere has been nothing much of interest to write, Both sides have been doing more shelling. Our old enemy Jericho Jane has opened up several times but fortunately they have missed us. It is remarkable how well the horses stand the heat. It is no uncommon occurrence to see them sweating on the line. Most of us have Septic Sores. My hands at present are very bad. There is no chance of sore hands getting better while one has to look after Horses. We are changing with the New Zealanders tomorrow night. The camp is situated some 5 miles back in a good possy, near water. \n\nHow pleased we shall when we get up out of the valley. It has been an eye opener for the Turks who it is said confidently expected us to retire on Jerusalem. It is the thoughts of getting out of here which makes one able to stand it.. Scorpions are numerous & a bite from these pests is no joke. Flies are bad & with other pests do not make it by any means a desirable camp. One on seeing Jericho as it is now, with the turret of the Mosque & the hovels which constitute this place can hardly realise that in the old days it was a big city. There seems to me no doubt that the\n\nvalley is the wilderness so often mentioned in the Bible. I often feel that I would like to explore some of the Goat tracks which can be seen riding up the road from Jericho to Jerusalem.\n","521":"\n\nWe moved last night to this position changing over with the New Zealanders. This is one of the best positions in the Valley. The Wadi Kelt where we water is only about 5 minutes from camp & water for bathing is plentiful.\n","522":"\n\nOff colour on Sick Parade\n\n2ND Brigade had a successful\n\nsmash at Jacko last night down by the bridge. We have been busy lately making Dunny Houses . It seems very funny. Our planes are overhead daily from morning till night. They are keeping the enemy’s planes high in the air to prevent them seeing camouflage. The dummy horses are standing in rows, & among the dummy camps & giving Jacko the impression that we are reinforcing this Sector strongly with troops. We hear the Turks are concentrating strongly opposite in the hills of Moab. We hear there is a big stunt coming\n\nshortly but our forces intend to strike is not known. Our Horses are as well as it is possible to be in this climate and I think most will welcome the stunt to get out of here.\n","523":"\n\nIn Hospital\n","524":"\n\nMachine gunners moved to more protected possy to day.\n","525":"\n\nThe last week I have been off colour & was sent\n\nto Jerusalem rest camp for a weeks spell. This rest camp is run by the Division for the troops in Jericho. It has been found that many of the boy’s if they can get a week’s spell, it often saves what may be a serious illness in Hospital.\n\nWe caught the Motor Lorry at Jericho & were taken to the rest camp situated about one mile from Jerusalem in a building which was at one time a Convent. We arrived here about 5 pm & found it very cool after the valley. The difference in climate is easily understood when the Jericho flat is 1200 \n\nft below Sea Level & here is about 3000 ft above sea level. On arrival we were examined by Medical Officer & then issued with Tobacco, & Comforts from Red Cross Depots. The grounds were covered by EP tents among olive trees. What a fine home this is compared to what we have been used to.\n","526":"\n\nHere there is nothing to do. The food is excellent & we spend our time reading, writing & yawning. I went into Jerusalem to day to have a look round.\n","527":"\n\nWe hear the big stunt is about to commence. This camp is closing up & every available man is going down to the valley for what we hope the final smash. Excitement is running high. I have enjoyed myself here. It has been so quiet & such a change to be away from Horses for a while. Have heard we will all be rejoining our various units to morrow.\n\nWe heard a heavy bombardment in the direction of Nablus during the early part of the evening.\n","528":"\n\nLeft Jerusalem Rest camp for Jericho. Arrived about 11 AM & camped near dump until horses arrived. We had the wind up today. They started shelling. We were camped next to ammunition dump & this is evidently what they were after. Every minute we expected the lot to go up in the air but once again we were lucky.\n","529":"\n\nOur Horses came today & I rejoined our unit. It is known now that the Turks have been misled as to \n\nour movements & everything points to the Turkish Army being smashed at an early date. The valley here is only held by our Division, English Battery & Indians.\n\nThe Turks concentrated big numbers of troops opposite thinking that the attack was coming from the valley. At some places there is practically no \n\n line only patrols out. General Allenby head quarters at Jerusalem were only a blind. Some little time prior to this date Troops were coming down in the valley by day & leaving by night. The attack opened up at Nablus & our Boys sneaked up the coast surrounding\n\n \n\nthe Turks. It is bad luck us being out of it here but we expect to move in a day or two. Things are quiet here but would not be if Jacko knew how thinly the line was held. A large dump was built out towards the Dead Sea & Bedouins were told that it was for the Australian Horses. The Sheriff of Meccas forces we understand are swinging round by the Dead Sea & expect to link up when the cordon is complete.\n","530":"\n\nGood news keeps coming through. Our forces on the coast are pushing on capturing many prisoners. We hear that the\n\n \n\nAustralian Div & 5th Mounted Brigade are practically at the back of the Enemy.\n","531":"\n\nHaifa was captured today also complete Aerodrome & thousands of provisions.\n\nBrigade preparing to move out. We are moving at day break\n","532":"\n\nMoved out at 5 AM towards River crossing about 10 AM.\n\nWe moved on to Shunet Nimrin about 7 miles across flat from Jordan River. Once again we are here but I think this time there will be no turning back. The","533":" Brigade are ahead somewhere and the Turks are retiring. We moved on again\n\n \n\nat 2 pm up the road towards Esault. Progress was slow owing to our transport & the hilly nature of the road.\n\nWe passed great quantity of stores, rolling stock, guns & equipment left by the Turks in their hurried retreat. The Handley Page bombing planes played havoc among the Turks constantly bombing them as thy retired We saw the gun Jericho Jane which gave us so much trouble overturned in the bed of a Wadi. We kept going until 9 pm and camped on road about 3 miles below Esault. That night we had no sleep due to Mosquitos\n\n \n\nwhich were there in swarms.\n","534":"\n\nYesterday the road was blocked & we only proceeded a few miles \n\nToday we moved at 6 AM \nThursd\n passing through Esault about 9 AM. Esault lies practically half way up the hills of Moab & a fine defensive position it is. One wonders on looking down on the Flat from here, why the Turks did not concentrate heavy Artillery here & simply shell us off the flat.\n\nCasualties among our Troops are exceptionally light but the Turks have suffered heavily. Thousands of prisoners are coming through & Transport\n\n \n\nblocking the road makes travelling slow. Getting supplies is a big undertaking as the railway is finished at Jerusalem & they have to be brought in by Motor Lorry a distance of over 40 miles. We arrived at village about 6 pm & opened up 3RD receiving first. We had bout 40 casualties pass through during evening. The great difficulty here is that there is no Transport available for wounded. Receiving stations have been opened at Esault but the casualties have nearly 50 miles of travelling to do before they reach the casualty\n\n \n\nclearing which is at Jericho.\n\nThe stench of the dead Horses Camels etc is very high & it is proposed to put the prisoners on the job to bury them.\n","535":"\n\nThe war is practically considered as good as finished in our sector. Numbers of prisoners came in to day and we are all on short rations owing to the prisoners having to be fed. A sorry crowd they looked. Some were mounted but the majority were in rags, \n\nWhen they came near the water they simply charged at it like a lot of\n\nanimals. They seem glad to be captured. Turkish ponies are roaming all over the place. There are any amount of Souvenir’s to be gathered but we have no means of carrying them \n","536":"\n\nOur present position is at Whalem a Sarcassian village of white houses. The Sarcassians are undoubtedly favourable to the Turks and view us no friendly eyes. Yesterday they fired on small parties of out chaps. German machine Gunners at Amman fought at their guns practically to the last man. Estimated number of prisoners is now 35000\n\n \n","537":"\n\nMoved on to Amman railway station last night to form another dressing post. Beautiful country here. Another heavy haul of prisoners arrived to day. We camped just below Amman Station. The position was covered in stones & there were hundreds of dead horses & camels about the camp.\n","538":"\n\nWe are waiting here for 6000 Turks who have been cut off in the Desert. They cornered by the sherif of mecca’s forces & ours. It is only a matter of a few days when they must come in. Where we are camped is at Amman Railway station situated\n\n \n\nabout ½ mile from Amman Village. The Railway is the Mecca to Damascus line. Amman proved a prize to the Boys.\n\nIt is here that our campaign is ended. Beyond this we are told is a 50 mile desert. Practically the whole Turkish Army has been captured & Jacko is completely smashed. The area round here is a sight to see. Amman station is blocked with Jacko transport, They have practically left every thing behind. There are dumps with any amount of equipment. Dead Horses & Camels are all over the place & the smell & Flies \n\n are very bad.\n\n \n","539":"\n\nWe are expecting to move in a few days to a better camping ground. It is impossible to stay here for long or all hands will be in Hospital. The weather at present is beautiful & large numbers of Turkish prisoners are coming in daily. \n\nTeusday","540":"\n\nWe rode down to the Water troughs about one mile from station with a number of prisoners to bury the dead Horses. The 1ST Brigade are camped near this area.\n","541":"\n\nHad a look round Amman Turkish Hospital & Aerodrome on the hill to day. We hear\n\n \n\nthat there were two trains of Turkish wounded deserted on the railway. First train passed through Amman to day. Efforts are being made to get the wounded Turks into Hospital. The Turks left the Hospital equipment & lots of Medical supplies\n","542":"\n\nCleaning up Amman Railway station Malaria getting bad in Division. The trip to the clearing station occupys two days from here. The Brigade is going out today to bring in the wounded from the desert. We hear they are starving & in a bad way.\n\n \n\nDivisional train is accompanying them with all the G.S. Waggons available.\n","543":"\n\nAll hands preparing Hospital for reception of wounded which are expected some time to night. The site selected is an old German hospital. The Germans always had separate Hospitals & quarters & lived better than the Turk. Any thing was good enough for the Turk. The Germans had the best of everything Judging by the number of bottles found empty they must have had a picnic.\n\n \n","544":"\n\nThe Turks arrived last night about 8pm. They were in a pitiable condition. They were starved & the wounded had not had their wounds attended too. A number died coming in & others after they arrived. We worked all night making them as comfortable as possible. Today a convoy of Motor Lorries came and took them further down the line. Most of them were unfit to travel but there was nothing else for it. I have found by experience the Turk is done without water. They have no other beverage & unless\n\n \n\nthey get plenty of water they soon throw up the Towel\n","545":"\n\nAnother batch arrived to day. It was a beautiful day to day and we will all be glad to get out of here.\n","546":"\n\nMalaria is getting very bad. It is now about 12 days since we moved out & they tell us it will take that time to develop. It is surmised that the Division was infected through sleeping in the Jordan Valley after penetrating the Turkish lines. Our unit is getting short handed and other units are\n\n \n\nsimiliarly affected . Reinforcements are not yet arriving & I hear there will be none available until we move back out of Malaria country. The state of affairs at present existing proved conclusively that the methods used in the Valley & elsewhere viz Canilisation & oiling stagnant pools with Kerosene did to a very great extent keep it down.\n","547":"\n\nWe have received good news from all fronts & we all think the war will end this year. It is rumoured that all 3 yr & over service will shortly be going home.\n\n \n","548":"\n\nDivision moved up on the hill today. We are moving to Amman tomorrow to open up a receiving station. We are practically down to half strength. The situation is getting alarming. It is just as well we beat the Turks before the Malaria got a hold. Otherwise we may have been up against it. Five of the boys lost their lives today through examining a bomb they picked up. It exploded with disastrous results. Bedouins from surrounding villages are here looking for plunder. \n\n \n","549":"\n\nToday we moved into village of Amman taking over a small stone building as a Hospital.\n\nAt the back of us is the remains of a huge Amphitheatre of roman days. It is worth seeing. Tiers upon tiers of large stones formed in a circle & used as seats to look over the arena. We are exceptionally busy here. The boys are brought here from the various units camped some two miles out. We keep them here for the night & if they are fit to travel they leave by Motor Lorry at 4 AM in the morning for the next station at Esault. From Esault to Jericho, Jericho to Jerusalem \n\n \n\n& down the line to the base camp.\n","550":"\n\nWe have heard the good news to day. The Germans in France are being badly beaten & hostilities are likely to cease at any time. \n\nThere is some kind of Plague in Amman. It is estimated 40 are dying daily. It is a big percentage for a small village.\n","551":"\n\nWe are losing men every day going to Hospital with Malaria. We opened this station with 12 of us & O.C. Today there is only 3 of us & O.C. Our duties are heavy. Every day we are up at 4 AM & generally finish about 11pm We are getting more patients \n\n \n\nthan we can handle. There is however no chance of relief so we will have to hang on. It is estimated that 40 % of our Division have caught Malaria.\n","552":"\n\nStill on Hospital duty. Meet all my old pals going through to Hospital. Malaria at present shows no sign of abating.\n","553":"\n\nWe expect some reinforcements tomorrow. The O.C. has wired to Jerusalem for them. Impossible to carry on indefinitely under these conditions. The weather since we have been here has been beautiful. I have not\n\n \n\nhad a chance for a ride & although the horses are only a couple of hundred yards from the building I have not seen them.\n","554":"\n\nWe heard today unofficially that hostilities had ceased. The hills are patrolled by Indians. We heard to day that the Sircassians & inhabitants of Amman were arming. They will get a rough spin if they start playing up. This afternoon I went to the top of the hills. It is a big plain in parts covered with stones believed to be ruins of some ancient city. Some reinforcements arrived to day.\n\n \n","555":"\n\nThe weather still keeps fine and the climate at present is very much like our Australian weather. There is nothing of importance occurring. The Division is getting weaker every day owing to Malaria. It is believed we are staying here until the Sherif of Mecca’s forces take over this sector. \n","556":"\n\nWent over to Div Headquarters. On the way saw Turkish landing ground & all that is left of machines stationed here\n","557":"\n\n \n\nThis last week I have been down to a slight attack of Malaria. To day the Sherf of Mecca’s arrived here.\n\nI had heard such a lot about them that I looked forward with interest to meeting them. I never saw a more undisciplined lot of Troops. All hands seemed to go where they liked & do just as they chose. Some were mounted on Camels, some on Horses, Turkish mules & Ponies others were on foot.\n\nThey seemed fairly well dressed but there was no uniformity among them. They have the reputation of being plunderers & I must confess looked it.\n\n \n\nThe headgear worn by them showed them off to advantage It is similar to what the Arabs wear. As a matter of fact most of them are Arabs, but we are told that most of their officers are British but wear the Head dress. It is said they take no prisoners. However they look a wild & woolly crowd. How they show up in action I do not know but they have some good work to their credit. They are to take over the Town in a few days & then we are going to do a 7 days Trek to Richon for a spell & HOME in the near future.\n\n \n","558":"\n\nWe were told today that the Division lost 50 % of its strength. We hear we are moving back on Nov 1. The Sherif of Mecca’s forces are camped at different places here in Syria & it is said they are taking over full control. The inhabitants hate them so there is sure to be some trouble.\n","559":"\n\nWe are preparing to move. Some Indians have arrived to take over Possy. The Sherif Mecca representative was in town to day where there was a ceremony preparatory to its handing over. \n\n \n\n238\n\nSunday\n","560":"\n\nAll hands will have to lead spare Horses. Some of our fellows are done already God knows how they are going to stand a 7 days trek. We have only two NCOs Bert & myself. The SM is going to hospital. The boss is down but says he will ride & we are 60 % below strength. I will not be sorry to leave Syria. The Tribesmen here are a treacherous crowd & the inhabitants although they state they are pleased with us well away.\n\nMonday\n","561":"\n\nWe are leaving on Wednesday\n\n \n\nThe Trek will be in easy stages to spare the Horses. This I expect will be our last long Trek.\n","562":"\n\nWe are all pleased that the campaign is finished. Our days of travelling seem to be numbered & it is said we will soon be going home.\n\nGood news continues to come from France. The Germans are on the run & the betting is 6 to 4 that it will finish next month. What a grand Christmas it will be if the world is at peace again. Received mail to day. All well.\n\n \n","563":"\n\nWe moved to day New Zealanders moved a few day’s ago. We passed through the narrow lanes of Amman about 9 AM. This is one of the dirtiest villages I have seen. It is situated between two hills which are ideal defensive positions, hence our failure to hold this place on two previous occasions. From Amman we rode some miles across a plane & then down the winding road to Esault situated as related before practically in the centre of the hills of Moab. On arrival at Esault we camped just off the\n\n \n\nroad for the night. It was pitch dark on halting By the time the horses were watered & fed it was midnight. We therefore had very little rest\n","564":"\n\nWe continued our journey to Shunet Nimrin today. It was only a short trip some 12 miles We arrived early in the afternoon & enjoyed a good wash in the Wadi. On our way down the Esault road we saw the signs of Jacko’s recent retirement although anything of value had been removed to our dump. At various turns of the winding road we saw a fine panoramic\n\n \n\nview of the whole Jordan Valley. It seems more remarkable than ever that we were able to hang out in the Jordan Valley when the enemy held such defensive positions as these. We camped at the foothills preparatory to resuming our journey across the valley to morrow.\n","565":"\n\nWe proceeded from Shunet Nimron to day & crossed the Jordan Valley probably for the last day. It was very hot and a heat haze hung over the Valley. What a desolate place the Jordan Valley is. Practically barren with mountains of Judea or the Judean Hills they are termed facing us \n\n \n\n& the mountains of Moab behind. We saw all the old positions, Barb wire entanglements etc which we had no time to notice on our advance. We crossed the old Jordan river which flows into the Dead Sea which I hope never to see again . It resembles its name as there is no sign of life & nothing can live in it. On taking a swim one is covered in Salt on getting dry & a fresh water bath is desirable. We continued our way to the Foothills & expected to camp here for the night. On account of the dangers of Malaria we were ordered to push on to Telat El Dump. We passed the \n\n \n\n244\n\nAustralian Cemetry where some of our boys are resting. I could not help thinking there are many places in the Jordan Valley where we camped that white men will not walk again. The road from Jericho to Telat El Dump is very steep, Our horses were done on arrival and a lot of transport could not reach here owing to Horses being knocked up.\n\nMondayNov4\n\nWe rested at Telat El Dan to day owing to Horses needing a spell. It was hot & dusty. We had very little shelter so it was a relief when the day was finished.\n\nIt hardly seems true that we\n\n \n\nwill not be travelling over these well known roads again. One is glad to know it is true but I think I will always remember the night rides too & from the valley.\n","566":"\n\nTo day we moved on to Jerusalem. It was an easy days ride distance about 10 miles. Unfortunately our waggons were held up owing to the steepness of the road near Bethany. The \nLast\n horseshoe bend as it is known is a particularly steep piece over about a mile & our Transport horses could not do it. I had to go back with a spare hack & hitch them into their\n\n \n\nteam. We eventually arrived in Jerusalem about 7 pm & camped some 2 miles out on the Bethlehem road. It was cold here. Reinforcements were awaiting the Division at Jerusalem.\n","567":"\n\nWe passed through Jerusalem about 7 AM bound for Latron at the foothills. It was a very windy day. Going through Jerusalem the people watched us quietly moving on. It seems to me as a whole the people of Palestine do not seem to have much time for Australians. Going down the hills we saw some beautiful Panoramic views \n\n \n\nWe had mostly come through these places by night, or by forced marches & before did not have much time to admire the scenery. Just after passing the house where John the Baptist was born one sees a fine view of Jaffa, Ramley, Ludd & the sand hills with the blue Mediterranean in the distance.\n\nThere are also terraces upon terraces of stone & in some places the road runs perilously close to a sheer drop of many hundred feet. We arrived at Latron about 4 pm & camped for the night. \n\n \n","568":"\n\nLeft Latron about 8 AM & proceeded on the last stage of our journey. We passed through Ramley just after 12 and arrived at our old camping ground about 2pm. Fortunately we had fine weather all the way & fairly easy stages.\n","569":"\n\nAs we are likely to be some little time we are making ourselves as comfortable as possible. There are plenty of tents available now & most of us have made wooden beds. Richon at present looks its best. We are expecting the rainy season any time now so are preparing for it.\n\n \n","570":"\n\nWe heard today that all 1914 men are going home almost immediately. They will be back in Ausy by Christmas. There is not much to be done here so we should have a good time. \n","571":" Rumoured today that Germany had thrown in the towel. The boys are beginning to get excited. We have now built an \nopen,\n oven kitchen & mess hut so are living under decent conditions for this country. All hands are looking forward to the day when we start for Ausy.\n\n \n","572":"\n\nToday about 5pm the news came through that Germany had thrown in the Towel. Needless to say there was wild excitement.The Batterys were firing, Torches & Flares made the skie seem like day. The horses stampeded in our lines and it was some job to catch them. Everybody was happy for after 4 yrs of war Germany has at last been brought to her knees.\n","573":"\n\n2ND Brigade sports today. There is very little to do now except enjoy yourself as well as possible under the conditions.\n\n \n","574":"\n\nTo day was wild. The wet season is upon us & we had plenty of wind & rain. All our tents blew down & a nice job it was putting them up again. As far as we can understand we are here until after Christmas.\n","575":"\n\nStill we & cold nothing doing. New Zealand sports were supposed to be held today but were postponed on account of rain.\n","576":"\n\nNew Zealand sports were held today in fine weather. General Allenby attended & we all witnessed a fine days sport.\n\n \n","577":"\n\nSecond day of sports Beautiful day. The inhabitants if Richon were at the sports today. We heard today that permission had been granted to build a Racecourse also, that we were to be photographed by official photographer. The Horses are looking well & fit & have earned a rest now that the campaign has finished. We have no complaint to make here as the heads are doing all they can to make our time of waiting until embarking for home as pleasant as possible. We have plenty of sports, football, & one can get leave to visit the various Towns handy.\n\n \n","578":"\n\nToday a few of us rode to Jaffa for a swim & general look round. The Town has been cleaned up and there is a remarkable difference to when we first entered it. \n\nIt is now quite a business place & the inhabitants as is usual in this country try to palm off practically worthless souvenir’s on our boys at top prices.\n\nWe returned about 6pm after a very pleasant day.\n","579":"\n\nToday we visited the villages of Wadis, Heatean & Dieran. They are still the same sleepy villages we saw last time we were down. These are Jewish villages. There is a Bedouin village\n\n \n\nnear the camping ground called Surafend. The Bedouins here are thieves and are always after Horsefeed, rations & Clothing. There is sure to be trouble if this thing is allowed to go on.\n","580":"\n\nto day there were 800 horses shot out on the sandhills. They were all aged Animals or worn out. It seemed a pity that they should meet with this reward after faithful service but it is better so \nthat that\n for should they fall into the hands of the Bedouins or Jews they would have a rough spin. The Bedouins & Jews as a body are very cruel to Animals.\n\n \n","581":"\n\nThe last week or so there has been nothing of interest to write. We have built a Divisional Race course with stand & Steeplechase track. All the good horses are in training for the coming Divisional Races which promises to provide a good days sport. First day Race Meeting. Second day Children’s & Divisional sports. The kiddies of Richon are delighted at the prospect. We have had several inspections by our OC in preparation for the inspection by Div, Corp Generals & GOC. General Allenby.\n\n \n\nThis we are told is the last time General Allenby will inspect our Division. We have had the Odds On & Brigade Concert party of an evening and on the whole having a good time. The 1914 men have left for home & it is expected we will get away in the New Year.\n","582":"\n\nWe were inspected by Gen Chaytor the Div General to day. He is most popular as the leader of the Anzac Division. It was a warm day & we were all polished up like Jacky. The General complimented \n\n \n\nthe Division on its appearance.\n","583":"\n\nInspection by Gen Chaytor today. Gen Chaytor is in command of the Australian & New Zealand Mounted Troops on this Front\n","584":"\n\nWe had a Donkey Polo match to day. It was the funniest thing I have taken part in for a long time. The little Grey Donks seemed to enter into the fun & when the feed up whistle blew they all cleared out for home & ended the game. Auckland Reg are holding a race meeting tomorrow to pick out the best for the Div Races.\n\n \n","585":"\n\nAuckland & Wellington both held races today. We saw the Philistines Concert party in the evening who gave a good show.\n","586":"\n\nThe last few days have been wet & cold so there has been nothing doing. I have spent the time Reading, Writing mail & playing cards\n","587":"\n\nWeather has cleared up again & today we had our Photos taken by the official Photographer\n\n \n\nA New Zealand picket was shot last night by a Bedouin. Excitement is running high among the Boys as what Headquarters will do in the matter.\n","588":"\n\nThe crowd went mad today. Unless something is done they threaten to burn down the Bedouin camp. Things are looking ugly. I do not think it will come to this but I think it is time Headquarters moved on the matter.\n","589":"\n\nLast night the Division exacted revenge on the Bedouins at Surafend & a camp situated near the lines. They surrounded the village & asked for the guilty\n\n \n\nman. Some trouble occurred and they brought the Women & Children out & killed every Man in the village. They burnt the village to the ground & returned to their units. It was a severe punishment but when one comes to think of the small parties the Bedouins have got hold of at different times & at various places they badly needed a lesson. There is sure to be a big row over the affair & it is rather a pity that it happened. However my sympathy is with the Boys for these wandering Bedouins have been a curse right through the campaign. Today all that is to be seen is the\n\n \n\nburning village. The Ambulances are busy getting the wounded into Hospital & burying the dead.\n","590":"\n\nDivisional Races tomorrow. There was a rumour flying around that the Races are to be postponed owing to the trouble a couple of days ago but we have heard nothing about it yet.\n","591":"\n\nTo day turned out fine & we had a fine days sport. There were six races on the programme. One Steeplechase & five flat races. Race books were printed & sent up from\n\n \n\nCairo. All the riders in the various races wore racing jackets with their own colours. It was a sight worth seeing.\n\nThe New Zealand Brigade Band rendered popular music & the Tote was going in full swing. Most of the boys rode over and there was one long string of Horses just outside the course. There was a good number of Civilians from the various villages principally Troops. The different Troops were well represented Indians, Tommys, French, Italians B.W.I. Gypo’s Australian & New Zealanders. There was only one accident in the\n\n \n\nSteeplechase & fortunately that was not serious. We spent one of the best days sport we had spent in this country.\n","592":"\n\nIt rained again to day. We received Reinforcements to day. To morrow is an inspection by G.O.C. General Allenby. We anticipate some trouble over the Bedouin affair.\n","593":"\n\nInspection was held today in the square just outside the Artillery camp. The General Turned us down. He gave a lecture to the troops & told us we had committed an offence which the Turks \n\n \n\nnever did. He finished up by saying that once he was proud of the Anzac Division now he was ashamed of them. The Divisional & Brigade Generals were dumbfounded & the boys were \nso\n quiet owing to it coming as such a shock. The whole Division is disgusted at the treatment received. It was certainly a regrettable incident but it did not merit the punishment, or the remarks which were made.\n","594":"\n\nTo day we moved to \nJaffa\n Raffa. If it had not been for the Bedouin incident we should probably have been here for Christmas. Last night\n\n \n\nheavy rain set in and the prospect of a ride does not strike me as being pleasant. About this time last year we accomplished the same trek under somewhat similar conditions. We left camp about 9 AM. We were supposed to reach Succarea but failed to get through the mud just outside Yebnah. We camped in the mud. The road was fairly good until we reached Yebnah after that it was simply a mud flat.\n","595":"\n\nMoved on towards Megil arrived there about 9 pm. Our\n\n \n\ntransport Horses are done.\n\nCrossing the flats near Edud we were axle deep at times in mud & water\n","596":"\n\nToday was fine & we reached Gaza about 1pm. Gaza has altered considerably since we were here last. It is now a big receiving hospital. The Town has been cleaned up & the cemetery has been laid out thoroughly. The Australian & New Zealand Forces lost heavily at Gaza at different periods.\n","597":"\n\nWe left Gaza about 9 AM moving\n\n \n\non to Beilah. The roads were good & we arrived about 1pm. We camped near the large hospital here\n\nFriday\n ","598":"\n\nToday about 2pm we arrived at Rafa which is to be our camping ground until we move for home.\n","599":"\n\nNothing doing straightening up camp.\n","600":"\n\nReturned to Richon to place captured Turkish wagons on the dump at Ludd. Tommy came with me & we took the \n\n \n\nTrain to Ludd. after leaving Gaza it rained & we arrived at Ludd wet through. We slept that night in the Canteen\n","601":"\n\nWe walked from Ludd to Richon to day & borrowed a pair of Horses from Bridging train. We caught the 5pm train from Ludd arriving at Rafa about 6AM next morning.\n","602":"\n\nChristmas day. We spent a good Christmas. The weather was fine & we had plenty of Food & Drink. Our Boss told us today that we would soon be going home. \n\n \n","603":"\n\nBoxing day. They held a race meeting which provided a good days sport. Old Tom left us for home to day.\n","604":"\n\nFarewell inspection by General Chauvel to day. He complimented the Division & stated he was proud to have them under his command.\n","605":"\n\nAnother Race meeting to day Preparing for a days sports’ meeting.\n\n \n","606":"\n\nThere is very little to do. We have made ourselves comfortable & expect to have a good easy time here.\n","607":"\n\nDad Williams returning to New Zealand. The boys are beginning to move for home now.\n","608":"\n\nThe last day of the old year. The boys have a celebration on to night, a Concert party is coming over tonight.\n\n \n","609":" – 1919 \n\nThe old year passed quietly and another year has commenced. It is said that all the Troops from this front will be home in Ausy for Easter.\n","610":" – 1919 \n\nWe have made ourselves comfortable at Rafa. It is getting monotonous waiting for the time to go home.\n\nThere is very little doing.\n\nThree times a week we have lectures under the Educational scheme. We have Race meetings twice a week, Football & sports to fill in the time of waiting.\n\n \n\nThe beach is about 3 miles from here & occasionally we ride over for a swim. The horses have all been graded A, B & C class & we expect to lose them. A & B class are to be kept. C class we understand are to be shot. There is plenty of leave kicking about & \nnext week\n tomorrow I am spending a week in Cairo\n","611":"\n\nGoing on leave to night by the 5pm train. I expect it will be my last leave in Egypt for we will shortly be going home.\n\n \n","612":"\n\nLeft Rafa in the usual old Trucks about 5pm last night. It was a cold trip down & we arrived at Kantara about 6 AM. We walked across to the other side of the Canal & had breakfast at Mrs Chisholms at the Canteen then catching the 8.30 AM train to Cairo.\n\nWe arrived in Cairo about 1pm and stayed at Soldiers Club.\n","613":"\n\nArrived back at Rafa about 6 AM. I had a fine weeks spell. During my stay I visited all the old sights probably for the last time. I visited\n\n \n\nHeliopolis, The Barrage, Sphinx Pyramids & had a general look round. During my visit there was heavy rain in Cairo & we saw the City in flood. The streets are flat & the footpaths are graded to the shops. Naturally when the heavy rain set in the water all so flowed into the shops.\n\nOn the Heliopolis Electric Railway the walls collapsed for a distance of about 50 yds holding up the railway for a few days. A spell away from the Horses undoubtedly does one good also the change of diet. I met a number of my old pals on leave & from \n\n \n\nthe","614":" General Hospital. I expect some to be going home\n","615":"\n\nGreat excitement today about 200 men belonging to the Division are going home. I believe I am among the lucky number to go Transport duty. We are eagerly waiting for the news to be confirmed. To night we are having a little celebration & farewell party to some of our pals.\n","616":"\n\nLast night was a wild one Tom & I are leaving by the Train to night to report at Moascar\n\n \n\n& expect to leave for Ausy in a few days. I feel anyhow & have put the day in getting ready. It is now 6Oclock and we will be leaving in a few hours. Those that are going are busy saying goodbye to their pals. We are all pleased that the time has at last come to leave for home although one will lose some good pals. I trust whoever gets my horse will look well after him for he has been a good faithful pal to me during Active Service. Had I my choice in the matter I would have liked to have brought him home to Ausy. There is no doubt I have had some good times since I\n\n \n\nhave been with the Anzac division. The Division has been in some tough corners in its time and has always acquitted itself well. In my time we have trekked from Rafa to Amman on several occasions.\n\nMy opinion of Palestine is that it is a much overrated country. Certainly some of it is very fertile and would give good results but water seems to be the trouble in many parts. The Light Horse in Palestine have had a lot to contend. When out of the line we have had no opportunity for visiting. At the best it meant a trip to Cairo or Alexandria where practically\n\n \n\noutside Soldiers one met very few who spoke the English language. The time has arrived for us to saddle up so my further impressions must for the present be discontinued.\n","617":"\n\nWe left for Rafa last night in a crowded Troop train. The usual trucks, very uncomfortable & not much room. However this we did not mind seeing that a few days we expect to be on board. We arrived at Kantara just on daybreak & caught the Motor Lorrys to the other side of the Canal where we had breakfast & resumed our journey \n\n \n\nto Moascar by the Egyptian mail. On arrival at Moascar our pay books were collected and we were allotted bell tents six to a tent.\n","618":"\n\nThe duties of the camp are very light. They are busy equipping us for our trip. There are plenty of new clothes to be had & some of us are badly in need of a rig out. We are going to Ismalia to night to buy a few things before embarking. Everybody is happy at the prospect of sailing on the Ceramic in a few days time\n\n \n","619":"\n\nInfluenza broke out on the Ceramic & we were delayed nearly a month. During the month we had several fake alarms that we were off. Half a dozen times the boat lists were made out but failed to materialize. It was a miserable time waiting in expectation. We had the easiest time I have ever had which made the time pass very slowly. With the exception of a dozen men for Guard duty & the fatigue party there was mostly nothing to do. We spent the time going into Ismalia & the various Concert partys.\n\n \n\nwhich came to the YMCA. To morrow we are supposed to embark on the Port Sydney for Australia. The boat lists are out & we are to embark at Kantara which is situated about half way on the Suez Canal.\n\nExcitement reigns high for it is generally believed that we will be going at last. Latest cable news from Australia reports the Spanish Influenza has obtained a firm hold in Australia. Judging from all reports it is a serious thing & seems to have the wind up them. All hands are busy packing for to morrow we have what we hope our\n\n \n\nfinal kit inspection & I hope that this will be my last night in Egypt\n","620":"\n\nThe day has come at last. At 10pm we were marched out of Moascar by special train to Kantara. We were all in the best of spirits knowing that at last we were on our way. We arrived at Kantara about 12 noon & Motor Lorries took our kits over to the other side of the canal. By 3pm we were all aboard the Troopship Port Sydney our future home for the next few weeks. About 4 pm\n\n \n\nthe Troopship moved out & to my delight moved off down the Canal. It was my first trip down the Canal & I had the opportunity of seeing what a wonderful piece of work it was. Once more we take to the hammocks for sleeping purposes.\n","621":"\n\nThere is little to tell. On the morning of","622":" we were in the Gulf of Suez & well on our way to the Red Sea. Coming through the Red Sea it was fairly cool.\n\nWe coaled at Colombo after 12 days out of Suez Influenza was\n\n \n\npretty bad so we were not permitted to land.\n\nThe trip from Suez to Colombo was smooth & very pleasant. Unfortunately we had a case of Smallpox on board which proved fatal. From Colombo to Fremantle we had good weather. What a difference it was coming home to what it was going.\n\nGoing there was plenty of work & coming home we had practically none. Between Colombo & Fremantle we were inoculated against Influenza. We were fortunate to have the Flying Corp Concert party on board & they gave some good Concerts. The Orchestra was also very much appreciated. We had\n\n \n\nto pass the Medical Officer at Fremantle & no leave was permitted owing to the Spanish Influenza. The Western Australians disembarked here. From Fremantle we sailed to Adelaide. The same procedure in regard to Medical examination was in vogue here. South Australians disembarked here. From here we sailed to Tasmania down the East Coast. It was rough & cold & our course lay close to the Coast. The Coast was very rugged & rough. We \nsailed up\n steamed up the River anchoring about seven miles below Hobart. The Tasmanians 16 in all disembarked. What a waste\n\n \n\nof money it is to commission a full Troopship to go from Adelaide to Hobart for 16 passengers. The climate the one day we were here was beautifully fresh & invigorating. We left Tasmania the following day for Melbourne. The trip was uneventful & we anchored just inside Port Phillip heads. The Victorians were taken to quarantine by lighter & we proceeded to Sydney.\n\nNext day we were steaming up the New South Wales coast. I recognised the various places along the coast. We entered Sydney Harbour about 10.30 AM on the morning of April \n\n \n","623":" What a beautiful place it seemed after our absence. We anchored just off Watson’s Bay & the Medical Officer came on board. We were then ordered into Quarantine for a week. This caused much dissent among the Troops as we were a clean ship.\n\nAll Sydney were wearing masks so the passengers on the Manly boats told us. Next day we went into Quarantine at North Head & were compelled to stay there for a week. That week seemed to me to go very slow,\n\nHowever we were well treated there having nothing to do.\n\n \n\nComforts Fund looked after us well with parcels & we had Pictures & Concerts during the evenings. On Easter Monday we were removed from Quarantine. All hands were up at daybreak getting everything ready to go home. The Ferry came about 9 AM. On boarding all hands were issued with masks & they took pains to tell us that they were to be worn on the face & not in the pocket. To the accompaniment to Cock a doodle dos we landed at Wooloomooloo & met our relatives & Friends. It was the day we had been looking forward \n\n \n\ntoo for such a long time.\n\nAt 2 pm I journeyed to the Barracks received my suit of Civvys & discharge. Once more a Civvy and in the best country in the world.\n\nI hope never again to go through the same experiences but must confess that now it is all over I would not have missed it under any circumstances. There is no need to write how pleased those at home were on my return. The house was gaily bedecked with flags & everybody was happy. I now close my Diary feeling a better man for my experiences in the Army & am fully convinced had \n\n \n\nGermany won life would not have been worth living\n\n"}}
