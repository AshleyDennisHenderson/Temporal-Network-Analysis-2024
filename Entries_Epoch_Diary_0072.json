Harry & myself went into Cairo on a ramble. We got out at the shop after the station & went looking for the famous mosque. After a walk round we got the right tram & got out at the citadel. the tram trip was through very \"low\" quarters. On getting out of the tram we bargained with a guide to show us over three mosques for 1 piastre each : On entering each mosque we had to pay 1 dieaster for our shoes : (everyone before entering has to get the slippers on) The first one was the blue mosque & the architecture very good the interior carvings etc being splendid. There were also tombs of one of the Sultans : his wifes & mother. The next one was the famous SF RAFFAI mosque & to get any idea of the interior one wants to imagine himself in fairyland : The walls are of slabs of alabaster & marble with beautiful grainrings & markings running through them. The roof was simply bewildering all beautiful domes painted beautiful colours & with gold. the chandeliers were of silver about 10 ft across: the wood work (doors etc)\n\n \n\nwere marvellous being inset with ebony & ivory & must have taken years to do. The \"pulpit\" in each one was also marvellous work. The gold all round the walls was bewildering. We have been told that this mosque cost nearly £3,000,000 to build. Some of the stone used was taken from the pyramids : next was the mosque that Napoleon fired at & was fairly interesting the marks of the cannon balls being visible:one hole about 60 ft from the ground still having the ball embedded in it. The exterior of all the mosques are rather on the worn side but the interiors are wonderfully preversed : all of these mosques are anything from 500 years old upwards. After the mosques we went into the citadel (Napoleon’s fortress) The mosque there is also marvellous: the lighting being supplied by hundreds of lamps suspended from the roof by long chains. The chandeliers here were magnificent (about 10 ft across) the roof was a series of domes each one forming the support of the next one. Outside was a well down to the level of the Nile. Rumour says that the builder was asked if he could build a better one & on replying \"yes\" had his eyes taken out: The old guns are still mounted there. From here we wandered out again & past the Egyption barracks & some very poverty stricken quarters to the Dead City & then up a pathway to the top of some high cliffs & the view was splendid. Pyramids in the distance Cairo on the right & the Dead City on the left & big quarries behind. These cliffs have rooms cut into them & are supposed to have been part of Napoleon’s fortresses. One archway through the rock is about 50 yards across & a splendid sight & seems to have been cut through ages ago\n\n \n\nWe wandered back through the Citadel & some \"Tommy\" welsh miners volunteered to show us the well that Joseph was put in. It was getting dark but we went down. It is about 400 ft deep & about 25 ft by 20 ft : cut through solid rock : round the well is a passage about 6 ft wide & high enough to walk upright in by which we descended a couple of hundred feet. As the tunnel winds down \"windows\" have been cut into the well & the thickness between tunnel & well is about 6 inches : the work all through is wonderful. On reaching the landing we found one of the old cog wheels (wood) used ages ago to draw water from the bottom & a similar wheel on top (still there) used to draw it up to the top. It was too dark to descend lower so we dropped stones & it seemed a long way down to the water. After an interesting chat with the \"Tommies\" we took the tram back & had a feed at the soldier’s Club in the Y.M.C.A. \"Park\" (Esbekiah Park) This is a nice place for a cheap & good feed Then we took the tram home & altogether had a very interesting afternoon’s ramble. I got the neck of an earthenware bottle down the bottom of the well. It teemed after tea & we got wet going home. Tent pretty dry during night. \n","49":"\n\nFine clear day : Revellie 6am : breakfast: church parade 9.45 am : After church parade our party (27) met our guide & we started on our trip that had been denied us for two Sundays.We walked to the tram & got in : alighted stop after the station & got into \"Gharris\" (carriages). We then drove through the \"Wazza\" & through\n\n \n\nCairo past the Sultan’s Palace (a beautiful place) till we got to the ferry to the island of Rodah where tradition says Moses was found in the bull rushes. The garden of Pharoah’s daughter (where moses was found) is still there but we only got a view from the land side of the canal. Next we paid a visit to the Coptic church built 950 A.D. old. The altars were beautufully inlaid with ivory the altars being the Father in the middle Son on the left & Holy Ghost on the right : under the church the Priest in charge led us along a passage to the cave where Jesus & his parents hid when fleeing from Herod. There is also an altar in the cave & next to the cave a place for christening (all underground) Service is held in the church three times a week & in Jesus’s crypt once a year Coptic churches are protestant, the church was built over the cave : the church is now under repairs : We then went to another Coptic church 1400 years old & this was also interesting : round the wall was an engraving representing Jesus being welcomed on his return on an ass from Assyria. The altars were arranged the same as the previous one & inlaid beautifully : Then we went to the oldest mosque round Cairo (Amyr mosque) 1100 years old there were originally 666 pillars of which about 140 are still intact. This is used once a year to offer up a sacrifice to commemerate Abraham offering his son. The mosques are mahommedan & each one has an alcove in the eastern side so that the people will know how to Kneel so as to face Mecca when they pray. We seen a good few praying & they seem very earnest about it. One pillar is covered with iron bars to prevent from being touched. The tradition is that it was \n\n \n\nbrought from the Soudan & the natives believed it flew from there & by touching it they received certain benefits One ruler did not believe this & to stop it had the rails put round it : In the centre is a building in which is a washing place to clean up before they pray : General Amyrs son is buried here. Then we drove through slums to the Tombs of the Marmeluks otherwise called the City of the dead. It is a beautiful place there being about 8 rooms & the tombs in them are splendid. The one of the Ibraham pasha grandfather of the present Sultan is a splendid one being 20 ft high & beautifully engraved. The chandelies & carpets were beautiful also the big clock. I got a string of the carpet as a souvenir. These are really the more modern tombs of the high men & take their name from the City of the dead which is the real tombs of the mameluks & is all round. The \"mameluks\" means slaves of the Arabs : The texts from the Koran hung round the walls & we also had a look at the Koran : had to wear sandals & a fair few people were there praying : They take their boots & socks off : Then we went to the mosques we seen yesterday \"Blue\" Sultan Hassan : & St Raffai mosques which I described yesterday : St Raffia the &pound3.000.000 one & some of the lamp globes cost thousands of pounds alone : the colours in the stained glass windows are beautiful & now alost art the pulpits beautiful : One door in sultan Hassan mosque about 25 by 10 ft copper & silver : then we drove to the bazaar untill the streets got too narrow for the gharris so we alighted & wandered through the bazaars pricing things. Some of the streets are only wide enough for two to walk abreast: we also passed a wedding : band in front then a lot of people\n\n \n\nsinging & then the carriages : the occupants were gaily dressed : we also passed three funerals & were very weird : paid mourners in front singing & the coffin carried behind : then we walked back to the Y.M.C.A. & had a feed & then went home & had a well earned sleep :\n","50":"\n\nclear day : very foggy in morning.

M Farlane also paraded for talking in ranks. They got two days. G. G. & one was let off with one day : breakfast : turned out in full kit & were marched off (all our brigade). After going a while we were formed up in mass formation & a photographer took a photo of the parade : dinner : march across the sand. We were going to do artillery formation on the way back but left it too late. We passed a lot of trenches & they are very up to date : wire entanglements & all : A few of the niggers were mobbed & their oranges taken off them. I think it is nothing more than German methods & my blood boils at the little notice the officers take of these assaults for they are nothing else : on the way back one officer was man enough to speak up & paraded all the N.C.O’s for allowing the men to break out of the ranks. He let them off with a lecture & a caution : paid 50 disasters after parade : tea : went to Heliopolis with Joe, Allan, & a mate of Joe’s (Bill Wright & E Chenhall did not turn up)\n\n \n\nhad a fair time pricing things & knocking down prices which is great fun : bought a couple of strings of beads : got home about 9.30 & went to sleep : Tom came back from hospital & looks very well : he had good tucker there but says it was very monotonous.

We were then detailed off for guard one hour on & five off. All my mates & myself were on the main gate & it was amusing stopping the natives. We commenced guard at 8.30am. I done 10 to 11am : 4 to 5pm : 10 to 11pm. The night was very cold & we had to lay on a concrete floor\n\n \n\nunder a sort of verandah & it was most uncomfortable & what with the cold & our equipment on sleep was very scarce. My impressions are that the \"Gypo\" reserve are not to be trusted. Today was their Sunday & they wanted to get out & crowded down to the gate. We were called out fully a dozen times during the afternoon to drive them back & they did not look at us too friendly at all. It was my first time on guard with loaded rifles. I got a few buttons for my collection. Reg & I went up to the canteen to try & get a small tin of jam. He wasted 3 piastres but we knew they only charged the reserves 1 piastre & that is all we would give him. He kicked up a row & the Lieut Colonel \"Gypo\" was just outside so I called him in & asked what the jam cost. He went pop on the canteen chap & gave us one \"backshees\". It was very acceptable as the rations were on the starvation side of things. The latrines here disgusted me. They all have a tap in each \"compartment\" & are the \"wallaby\" type & the methods of the natives were disgusting\n\nSaturdy Feb 12th\n\nclear hot day : cold morning : on guard at the \"Gypo\" barracks. My shift was 4 to 5am & 10 to 11am we were relieved by a Coy of New Zealanders about 12noon & altogether did not have a bad time excepting that we were hungry all the time. The rations worked out two small slices of bread & 1\/3 of a small tin of salmon to a meal : washed down with water : during the morning we had to again force back a crowd of the reserves who had begun to hang around the gate & their glances at us showed that they loved us like\n\n \n\nthe devil loves holy water. There are a fair few old cannon in the barracks ground also a fine pair kept polished (brass) at the entrance we were guarding. They look queer with their heep of balls behind them. The \"Gypo\" regulars seem a fine lot & look well in their black uniforms with white facings. The way they changed guard when their relief came was a picture : the march home was solid as armed guards have to march to attention all the time : they did not expect us back so soon at the camp & stew was short for dinner but we filled up on bread & jam washed down with water (no tea for dinner). After dinner we handed in our ammunition & then I took Alf & Lock over the Citadel. They were well pleased & the second look was just as grand to me. The inside walls are alabaster & that is the reason of the name (alabaster mosque) the hundreds of lamps are all fitted with electric bulbs now & it must look pretty when lit up. I got a thread of carpet as a memory of my visit. I showed them the well & they were surprised at the size of it also at the depth. We got in on a pass written out by myself. Alf & Lock stayed in town & I came home by myself : had tea & read till bedtime\n\nSunday Feb 13th\n\nclear cold day : cold morning : Revellie 6am : I went to Holy Communion at 7am & there were 18 present : The service was very long & the Chaplain must have been a high churchman as he had candles burning : Breakfast : had a shower while the\n\n \n\nothers went to Church parade.

Dan looked fairly well but was rather thin on it.

Huns graves: had dinner at Fricourt: got to our huts through a sea of mud about 4 P.M.: the mud is awful & we seen some laughable sights: one transport left its wheels in the mud & did not know it: met W Morgan in the 56th & he looked well\n\n \n\nthough muddy: it must take some organization to keep an advance going & the work needed is hardly credable till one actually sees it: packed like sardines so slept warm: heavy bombardment on \n\nSundat","325":" \n\nMontauban: cloudy showery bleak day: reveille 5am: breakfast 6 am: fell in in fighting kit & moved off at 6.30 am to a reserve position: a heavy bombardment was on during the morning I believe we are in reserve for the 7th stunt: we had to run about to keep warm: the poor lads from the trenches are all mud: fair few planes about in spite of the wind: plenty of tractors & other War gear about but I haven’t struck a \"tank\" yet: the 7th got their objectives alright but were bombed back again: got home through the mud about 6 PM: rained heavy at night\n","326":" \n\nMontauban: cold showery: up about 8am: issued with rations etc & moved off about 1.30PM: had tea in a gully among the guns & ploughed our way to the front line which we reached about 11 PM: the trenches are awful & up to our knees in mud & water: fairly quiet night\n","327":" \n\nTrenches: showery day: this front line is in front & a little to the right of Flers: there are a few villages in front & also a stiff looking wood: we have to carry across the open here with a white flag & Fritz does the same: the tracks are all knee deep in places & we have to have six on a stretcher: there is a tank close by & they are peculiar things alright\n\n \n\na cross between a turtle & a caterpiller is the best description of it: plenty of shells kicking about:\n","328":" \n\nTrenches: showery day: plenty of shells: we give him a rough time alright: our feet are very wet & swollen: we had a rough time with the cases after tea: Poor old Tom was sniped & then killed by a shell: he was a good mate & I am indeed sorry for his wife & children:\n","329":" \n\nTrenches: fairly clear day: we took the opportunity of taking our boots off & our feet swelled a lot: we had to take some of the boys down with their feet: the tank is a funny sight & I had a good look as I passed only a few yards off it: there are plenty of dead laying about: death finds men in funny attitudes one here is sitting in the trench with a bible where he has been reading: ‘planes were about galore & & some great duals took places as many as twenty being engaged at once: we seen a few come down: relieved about 10PM by the 19th : it was a rough time & where we jumped in was where most stopped till relieved: I guided No 7 over to Bgde H.Q. & we got a few shells as I got back & patched them up: took some cases round to the dressing station & then straggled home tired, weary,& full up of everything concerning war: the rum kept us going alright in the trenches: taubes about at night again: \n","330":" \n\nCarlton camp: got a feed & turned in: we are in tents: fair day: up at noon: plenty of ‘planes about & seen some good duals: a few taubes came down: Fritz sent a few shells over: there were a few ‘planes about again after tea: they were bomb dropping a few nights ago: the night was as bright as day: I am badly knocked up & have a bad cold too: \n\n \n","331":" :\n\nCarlton camp: dull cold day: up about 8am: there were over 100 cases of trench feet etc to be taken away so we had a busy time taking them down: Poole, Hatton & Roberts got away: after dinner the Doctor came round & we all had \"complaints\" & a fair few more got away: I am crook but can’t raise a temperature: fair few planes kicking around heavy mist after tea: Fritz put a few shells close by after we turned in: there has been a good few heavy bombardments lately & Fritz must be having a pretty rough time as well as us:\n","332":" \n\nCarltom camp: dull cold day: up about 8am: had a parade to see our strength: our casualties for the Coy was three off, & forty others while in the trenches our strength now is fifty six effectives so I hope we don’t have too rough a time in to night: We are out of action is the latest so are not going up tonight: plenty of balloons & ‘planes up & as usual some good duals: packed up & moved off to Mametz: pretty tired when we got there so slept well: heavy bombardment on : the mud is getting a little harder but is more stickier to march along in\n\n"}}
