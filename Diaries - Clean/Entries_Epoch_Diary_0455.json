Germany had been forced to make war, although Dr B. Hollweg had done his utmost to avoid it. The U. Boat campaign had been forced upon them thro England’s mode of fighting by the \"Starvation Blockade\" after Germany had lost all hope of Americas intervention. It was the only means left to them & it had proved more valuable, & is still doing so, than it was ever expected it would be. The latest offensive of the Russians had only brought the latter a very slight advantage & he had just recd a telegram from the front saying that Prince Leopold of Bavaria’s troops had broken through the Russian Defences. All other fronts were being held & the enemys hope of help from America were in vain. They could therefore meet all things with equanimity. In spite of all, there is a general wish for peace. Germany had not desired the war nor wished to make conquests\n\n31 (Saturday)\n\nin her power & therefore will not carry on the war a single day obtain a peace based solely on conquest. they want is to ensure the safety all times of the frontiers of the German Empire and a peace that will form the foundation of a permanent reconciliation the nations & which will prevent the present intention of the enemy to crush them economically. They had no intention offering peace again, but when their enemies have renounced their lust of conquest , & wish to come to an understanding the whole German nation & the German army & its leaders were united with them in declaring that they would be prepared to ask the enemy what he desires, & would be ready honestly & peacefully, to enter into negotiations, until then it was necessary to wait quietly & patiently\"\n\nThis is rather a disappointment to us.\n","100":"\n\n my foot dressed & cold compress applied this morning.

He also said that there are insufficient shelves & cupboards & that the tables are not large enough to accomodate 7 officers – He said we should have \nstools\n chairs instead of stools & was amazed when he was \n\n53 September 5th\n\ninformed that Beds had to be double banked in order to make more room. \n\nHe was informed of treatment meted out to officers who have been confined for attempting to escape – such treatment of officers has never been heard of – They were deprived of water & washing necessaries & private parcels also bedding – but as soon as the Dutch minister pointed out that he was not acting in accordance with the Hague Convention all these essentials were immediately forthcoming – \n\nHe said that the Canteen prices were appaling but that unfortunately he had no Jurisdiction over the canteen – Commander Lewis & Col Tollemache left no stone unturned in bringing before the ministers notice our just complaints – \n\nThe minister agreed that we should have more walks \nowing to such a small space whereby\n especially as we are confined in such a small area – \n\nI complained to him that my foot had got worse since being here, simply because I have not received any special treatment, also that there are still several splinters in my foot that on leaving Karlsruhe I was informed that I was being specially sent here for special treatment, this I have not recd – he noted all these facts & said he would\n\n54 Septr 5th\n\nsee that we received treatment – \n\nWhen questioned about the Dutch Exchange he said that the whole thing was being held up on account of the two Govts not being able to come to some decision as regards what route the transports would take – \n\nI am specially glad that the Dutch minister came especially for Robinson & Berlines sakes as they are being grossly unjustly treated – The Commdt informed Robinson that a neutral was representing them on the Court when Robinson acquainted the minister of this fact, he was astonished said that such was not the case as nothing had ever been heard of their case in Holland. So we all welcomed this visit, he arrived just at a very opportune time – he promised there would be a marked alteration soon, as this place was really not fit for a camp.\n\nThe Commdt & staff here were very affable during his visit, despite the fact they were all wearing very worried looks – \n\nRafe & Slee (Australian) attempted an escape last evening but were caught just as they were leaving the court yard – they have been awarded 6 days cells.\n\nRecd letter from Gert – Kate & Bay & A.IF Kit store\n","146":"\n\nGood sleep – Chairs arrived\n\n55 September 6th\n\ntoday as a result of yesterday inspection – \n\nReceived my tunic Breeches & Boots that I had in France, I feel quite Happy now \n\nHad a bath today –\n","147":"\n\nHad a special shoe made for my left foot today.

I was one of 4 guests making a total of 14 – It was an excellent turnout – Several toasts proposed & Mc wished many happy returns – Then the room was cleared for Bridge after which we had a few select dances, Lts Airth & Scisson being the stars of the evening – \n\nI adjourned to my room after a most enjoyable evening about 1 am when Tremlott & I had a few words resulting in me being pulled out of bed about 14 times. \n\nRoom 67 raided our room at my instigation; & we had a great old ruff & tumble for quite half an hour. Onlookers were highly amused. This attack was launched as a reprisal for the bad treatment meted out to Chisholm, the treatment to Chisholm being a reprisal for the bad treatment I’ve received on numerous occasions from Room 67.\n","238":"\n\nVaughan & I on duty today as Cooks – Today is our last day at Freiburg & in consequence, those officers including myself who are leaving for Heidelberg tomorrow are very busy. Packed all my heavy baggage by 2 pm & had it censored in the Chapel by Barney Flipsen at 4 pm\n\nInvited\n Stones, Tremlott, Staff & self took over 100 tins with us in my box. I invited Chisholm, McAnally, Lodge & Little P. to dinner tonight It being my last dinner, & they have indeed been true friends to me. As a souvenir I bequeathed my arm chair to Aylett & \n\nDecember 7th \n\nmaps to Chisholm.\n\nLecture by Col Williamson tonight on Evolution.\n\nVery busy tonight saying goodbye to all my friends, & obtaining their photos & addresses. Finished with the main building at 11 pm – Then after I visited all rooms in our building I spent half an hour in our room & had a drink all round after wishing them best of luck &c. I adjourned to Chisholms room, where I was very enthusiastically received. All drank my health sang, he’s a jolly good fellow, & after exchanging photos & addresses I eventually got to bed, feeling very tired –\n","239":"\n\nAroused 4 am. Had breakfast & finished packing my hand bag then bade good bye to all of my friends. All saw us off. We entrained by 5.30 & left for Heidelberg. It was rather a miserable journey, I did not like leaving so many good friends behind, they were indeed true friends & their innumerable kindnesses to me I can never forget.\n\nWe were coached to the Station & from Station to Heidelberg camp arriving there at 1 pm. Stingel accompanied us to Heidelberg & as we were leaving that Station He said goodbye & was I think sorry to depart with us. I know He thought a lot of me, & if there is ever anything I can do for him, I certainly will for he is undoubtedly the whitest German I have ever met & could wish to meet.\n\nIt is said that Freiburg is one of the best camps in Germany, this I am sure, & I can always consider myself lucky that I was there so long, & not drafted to Strohen Holtzminden, or any other camps in the 11th Army , where British officer receive extremely bad treatment – To bayonet an officer is quite a daily occurence & when one hears of such unpardonable treatment as to leave British Prisoners in a burning hut & make no attempt to rescue them, & further more bayonet them if they dare attempt to escape thro the window, I think it is well time that we relatiated on German prisoners in England instead of treating them like Lords –\n\nHad lunch & idled about for a few hours after which we were shewn to our respective huts. Depended on Bosche food today –\n\n96","240":"\n\nSlept in. Had afternoon tea with White. \n\nArthur Dent is here – a great shock when I first saw him, he was posted as \"killed in action\". Had long yarn with him & from all accounts he has had a very bad time. His Bn let him down, or sold him a pup, the Stunt he was in. \n\nIt is very cold here & \nall\n I am feeling rather depressed. I have been invited to mess with Gracie & Dalgety & co for the time being. Stones is in another mess, likewise Tremlott.\n","241":"\n\nParaded to Dr & granted permission to be absent from Roll Call. Nothing to do here except walk around & hot air & play cards. Saw Cull & McQuiggan, also met aust flying officer named Norvel. He has lost the use of one arm –\n\nPlayed Bridge –\n","242":"\n\nVery cold – Up early – today has been an eventful one for me. I with 80 others was examined by a Swiss & German Commission for repatriation. It was not a very thorough exam – He \nread\n a German General read my medical History & after a careful perusal of the X ray proof, had a look at my ankle & said that I would go to Switzerland. It was all over in about 5 mins, & just before I left, I was informed that I would be going to Chateau D’eaux – \n\nThe Commission examine the men at Mannheim tomorrow. Several officers have failed to arrive in time for the Commission. Played Bridge & had yarn with Cull.\n","243":"\n\nTaking Life very easy now. Simply sleep eat & play Bridge. Several officers arrived today \n& appeare\n met the Commission at their hotel on their return from Mannheim, & as they had finished supper & partaken of wine &c the candidates in question had no difficulty in passing for eligible for internment in Switzerland\n\n97 December 12th\n\nI am glad OByrne passed; I am extremely sorry that old Leckler is not with us & as soon as I am exchanged, I will certainly do all in my power to have him repatriated as soon as possible. It is a crying shame, when one knows that far worse cases than our own are being overlooked, & still our govt will not interest themselves unnecessarily as regards Prisoners of war –\n","244":"\n\nThere is a Cinema show here twice a week. Officers also go out for a walk twice a week. There are about 600 officers here French & English, & the Camp is run very systematically. The German staff here is equally as good as at Freiburg – very polite, perhaps it is because this is purely a concentration camp for people eligible for repatriation –\n\nVery cold indeed our mess is going along O.K. I play plenty of Bridge nowadays, especially with Tremlott & Stones & Gracie\n","245":"\n\n130 French officers, who passed the Swiss Comm. June last, left early this morning – \n\nHad long yarn with Matthews & Bernard, Australians of 5 Div captured last August,. They came from Strohen & have related to me some most horrifying incidents – I was glad to learn thro them that Gardiner & all 4 Bgde officers there are O.K. & well. Several attempts to escape have been made & quite a lot succeeded. Mott was successful in his first attempt –\n\nPlayed Bridge –\n","246":"\n\nThe cooking arrangements at this camp cannot compare with those at Freiburg, otherwise the camp is quite a good one – \n\nHad a glorious bath today, the bathing arrangements are simply perfect, that is where Freiburg goal failed. \n\nReceived my first parcel today it was forwarded on from Freiburg –\n\nFrench concert tonight The orchestra here is really splendid, simply marvellous for a Kriegsgefangener orchestra –\n","247":"\n\nThe Senior officer here is a naval Commander – He officiates at the English Service which is held every Sunday – we have a very nice chapel here.\n\nThe arrangements for Drawing parcels is more complete than at Freiburg, whilst the tin drawing system could not be better –\n\n98 December 10th\n\nThere is also a Hockey ground here, once used as a tennis court – The grounds of the lager are very spacious & I really think this is a better camp than Freiburg. It has more conveniences & the whole camp is administered & organised in a very systematic way – \n\n100 french officers left this morning per another camp, & there now remains very few Frenchmen. \n\n100 English officers arrived from Karlsruhe tonight – all roped in at Cambrai, Colonels, MOs, padres & all ranks to a S Lieut. It was an awful show, the Bosche attacked at two weak points of the salient, we were holding after our most successful surprise attack 2 few weeks before – He pierced to a depth of 1 mile & got behind our artillery & then advanced toward his own line, & cut off thousands. \n\nIt was indeed a terrible blow to our people. From all accounts troops had been holding the salient for \n10 days\n before, not relieved, & it was simply held by isolated posts, one comp being responsible for at least 800 yards – \n\nWe were warned too that the Germans were massing for counter attack & still we were surprised. The whole blunder is attributable to our faulty staff work. We make too certain of things & the feeling that the Bosche will never attack again, should be eliminated – People in England are very fed up with Haig now. He has not been too popular, but this blow will just about settle him –\n","248":"\n\nJust 2 years today since Bert & I left our Dear Home. It seems much longer – \n\nWe were shifted to another hut today, the Germans are renovating the roofs of some Huts. We are comfortably settled down in our mess now, plenty of food parcels are arriving & everybody is happy. Stones is with me –\n\nPlayed Bridge –\n","249":"\n\nRecd 2 parcels. Walked round square with Tremlott & Stones. We have a roulette school here & have endless fun of a night. I am getting settled more settled now, reconciling myself to my new surroundings. Had yarn with Cull & Mc. \n\nGeneral Plumber has gone to Italy to command the Ango French troops there – a French train accomodating 1000 French soldiers going on leave, was derailed when half way through a tunnel when an explosion followed – 900 were killed. The accident is said to be the \n\n99 December 18th \n\nwork of spies. It is a most regrettable affair. We allies are certainly having no luck, in this war, Russia is still as unsettled as ever – Shooting one another daily. The armistice has been extended, for a fortnight longer.\n\nInvited Cull & McQuiggan to tea & played Bridge afterwards –\n","250":"\n\nAll sorts of rumours circulate daily about our going away, we are all fed up with such rumours. Very cold – \n\nA German avaitor crashed just near our camp today & died shortly afterwards. He must have been an amateur, because he was hovering about trying to land where his mates did, & when He did land he dived into a mound of earth One escaped, rumour says the Pilot escaped & the observer was the unfortunate one.\n\nPlayed cards again.\n\n50 more officers from Karlsruhe arrived, all taken at Cambrai. It seems quite strange to see so many tin hats again.\n","251":"\n\nNothing doing at all just now, excepting we are all certain of leaving here tomorrow, as rumour has it the border is only open for 2 days commencing 20th. I have been designated as being in charge of the sweets – which I provide every day & therefore exempt from all other duty\n\nCull & I went to Pictures tonight – It was a very poor turnout –\n","252":"\n\nWhilst in conversation with one of the recently captured officers, I was informed that at the Cambrai show we had 400 tanks in operation & hundreds of guns & strange to relate the guns & tanks were brought forward & established without the Bosche knowing, despite the fact that his aeroplanes were daily over our lines & unable to detect the guns & tanks as they were so cleverly camouflaged. \n\nOn one occasion we counter-attacked with tanks & Cavalry. \n\nI was also told that we could have gone miles further, but as usual having accomplished our objectives, our troops sat down for a day or two, this enabling the Bosche to organise his men. It is the firm conviction that if our cavalry had only gone on we would have broken thro easily, but alas, we didnt & unfortunately we have lost all we ever gained. That is the 3rd time this year the Cavalry has missed its opportunity – It is very indeed to hear of all these failures, after 3 years of war.\n\nRecd parcel, attended concert tonight. It was an excellent show – Best I have attended in Germany – took ill suddenly after concert\n\n100","253":" \n\nHad bath today. No news of our going away so we are all resigned to spend Xmas in Germany.\n\nPlayed cards & had yarn with Cull. Invited Parkes to tea today – & played a challenged game of Bridge with him, against Toogood & Staff – we won –\n","254":"\n\nSnowing heavily today – & very cold – I packed my box today in anticipation of a hurried move.\n\nRecd parcel Cant understand why my cap & clothing parcels have not arrived. Played cards –\n","255":"\n\nEverybody busy today buying wine for Xmas I purchased 200 marks worth for our mess, out of Roulette earnings – All hands busy drawing tins, as none can be drawn tomorrow. We have quite a good grocers shop per our mess –\n\nSeveral people very merry again tonight – We played Roulette _ I was rather successful.\n\nChristmas Eve was nothing exciting except for a few who were slightly inebriated, & sang a few Carols, till they were forced by the extreme cold\nness\n air to keep indoors.\n\nAs a Christmas present I received most welcome letters from Mother, Fanny & Kate. It was my hearts desire to receive a letter from home for Xmas\n","256":" Xmas Day\n\nAttended Church today at 11 am. No celebration of holy Communion.\n\nAll our mess busy cooking & preparing for tonight. Each officer is responsible for one or two courses, whilst others, unable to cook decorate the table – It was a awful bustle cooking too, but our system worked well & we managed everything O.K. I invited Cull, & McQuiggan also the French officer making a total of 11 all told – \n\nWe feasted at 7 pm, Having Soup, Salmon, Rissoles Ham & Rabbit Pie, Turkey & Fowl & Roast spuds, Plum Pudding & Custard Blanmange & Jelly Tapioco Custard, Cigars & Boco wine. General toasts were proposed. I proposed toast of \"Those at Home\" – Jock Toogood was Chairman & without a doubt we had a most excellent turnout – Tremlott joined us with a few toasts. \n\nAfterwards some of us, accepted Tremlotts invitation & adjourned to his hut for a Drink & a sing song, but on \n\n101 Dec 25th\n\narrival there all hands were rather merry so we did not stay long.\n\nExceedingly heavy fall of snow tonight & all day today \n\nTonight word was recd that all officers for Switzerland will leave tomorrow night This news was gladly welcomed & we were so happy that we did not know \nhow\n what to do – all hands retired fairly early on account of making an early start tomorrow –\n","257":"\n\nAll Heavy luggage packed & taken to Drill Hall . I was one of the first & was successful in having my box & 5 Kit Bags censored by 11.30 am – I also succeeded in having my letters received in Germany, censored, also other valuable Documents, including my address book autograph book & Photo album – The search was not a very thorough one. Packed my hand baggage, this afternoon. \n\nFancy Dress Ball held tonight – It was a screaming farce Some appearances were really excellent\n\nPlayed Bridge, & after saying goodbye to my friends we paraded at 11 pm to be personally searched. This was not a very thorough one. We left camp all invalids in a coach, \nabout midnight\n 1 am & eventually entrained after almost freezing – Gracie, Tremlott Stones & I kept together –\n","258":"\n\nWe were taken off the train at some place at 8 am & provided with Breakfast, which was indeed very acceptable. \n\nOn arrival at Constance we were taken to some Hotel & there provided with another good meal, the best meals we ever had in Germany, supplied by Germans – It is typical tho of the Hun to make a great fuss of prisoners on leaving the country, so as to create a very good impression & also to forget \nwhat\n the bad treatment we had. \n\nWe entrained again at 8 pm & at 10 past 8 crossed the Border & said goodbye to Germany. Such cheers I have never heard before It was impossible for us to realise that we were actually in Switzerland & not in the land that we unfortunately will never forget – at all the big stations in Switzerland English spoken people greeted us most heartily & provided chocolates cakes cigarettes & Bouquets also coffee\n\n102 December 27th\n\nIt was simply delightful to be in conversation with Eng. people again. At some of the Stations bands played popular airs, commencing with our national anthem. It was a great time, we seemed to be able to forget all of a sudden the bad times we had endured.\n","259":"\n\nArrived at Bern at 2 am when we were welcomed by the British Ambassador Lord Newton & other Swiss authorities, we had an excellent meal, plenty of varied drinks. At such an early hour, it was surprising to see so many smiling faces & all doing something for our comfort. It was a grand reception & an occasion that one cannot forget – \n\nEverybody sympathised with us, & expressed how pleased they were that we were at last released. \nWere entrained again at 4 am\n we were split up having to catch different trains, all for Montreux entrained again at 4 am & arrived at 9 am & all along the line, we were cheered & cheered. It was a thrilling experience. We never felt so happy since being in captivity – \n\nOn arrival at Montreux we were accorded a civic reception & welcomed to Switzerland. Some very eloquent but flattering speeches were made by the Swiss authorities & in the absence of General Williams who is very bad, Colonel Anderson, responded very nicely & thanked the Swiss people for the very hearty welcome accorded us. Swiss military Band was in attendance & played all the national anthems. \n\nIt was here that we made our debeau numerous sympathetic friends introduced themselves & extended invitations to visit them &c. \nIt was indeed a happy day for all of\n After we had dined we were allocated to our various hotels, I being drafted to Hotel Beau Sejour Vevey with Tremlott Wilcox Toogood – Stones has gone to Pension de Comte, quite close to us – I have a room to myself mostly elaborately furnished, with every convenience. We have two very good friends already Mr & Mrs Peak who have supplied us with clothing – pyjamas &c. Spent night at Hotel & rested –\n\nToday has indeed been a happy one.\n\n103","260":"\n\nSlept in. Had splendid sleep, best bed I’ve been in for quite along time. Had bath this morning. \n\nAll our luggage arrived today in good order. I was very fortunate to get all my papers &c thro from Germany, which were concealed in various places – Certainly got one home on the bosche there.\n\nReported ourselves to Commdt de Peace, when we received written instructions & forms to be filled in & returned on Monday. \n\nVisited Montreux with Stones & Hoad & had afternoon tea together – introduced to Mrs & Miss & Mr Doubleday tonight & had dinner with them also Stones & Hoad. They are extremely nice people, & very proud of their Australian compatriots. Miss Doubleday is the renouned violinist, left Australia at age of 12 to come to Germany to complete her study. I have not heard her play yet, but she is known all over the world as being a perfect genius; We quite enjoyed our stay, & after dinner we adjourned to the Pictures, with Miss Doubleday & also made our debau at the Kursaal & Casino, & caught last train home\n","261":"\n\nSlept in. Did shopping in town after drawing £20 from Bank. Had afternoon tea with Cull also Stones & Skipper Hall, & had quite an enjoyable time – also had dinner with Matthews & Bernard after which I spent night with Matthews – \n\nMcQuiggan & all officers whom we left at Heidelberg to be exchanged to England, left Heidelberg yesterday for Holland & should arrive in England in a few days.\n","262":"\n\nSpent morning in town spending money. Had cards printed, & wrote letter to Kate & Mother. \n\nHad afternoon tea with Stones & then I called at Montreux for Cull & we motored to Vevey. I had Stones & Cull to dinner tonight, It being New Year’s Eve, We had an excellent dinner & had an orchestra in attendance all the time, after dinner God Save the King was played, & we wished everybody a happy new year – in Champagne. We officers also presented Mr & Mrs Peak with a beautiful Bouquet of Roses\n\n104 Dec 31st\n\nas a new year gift, in return for their many Kindnesses to us since being here – \n\nWe all caught 8 pm train for Doubledays, where we spent a most enjoyable evening, meeting a lot of new friends – It was the first time we were afforded the pleasure of listening to Miss Doubleday play the violin & it was really splendid. I cannot express how gracefully she plays.\n\n"}}
