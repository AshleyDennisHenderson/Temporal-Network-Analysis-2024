Many Australians are wearing wattle blossoms to day, which is being sold in the street particularly in front of the War chest Club.\n\nI posted my diary No. 8 to my wife to day, together with some Post cards. This makes the 10th parcel I have posted to my wife since I left France.\n\nThis afternoon I took one of \"Frames afternoon Trips in London.\" First we visited Westminster Abbey and saw the Royal Chapel, the Tombs of Famous Kings & Queens of Britain, the Coronation Chair – the place of coronation of all our Kings and Queens since William the Conqueror, the Poets Corner, and other things of interest. The tomb of Edward the Confessor & some others are covered up with sandbags. From here we were shown the House of Lords and the Kings Entrance. The first place we entered was the kings robing room and then into the House of Lords; and shown the\n\nKing’s throne, the Queen’s and the Prince’s. From the House of Lords we walked down a long straight corridor, which at places widens out into large Halls, to the House of Commons, \n\nWhen the King is on the throne in the House of Lords, he can see the speaker in the in the House of Commons, and were shown places where well known members sat.\n\nAncient Westminster Hall was also inspected. Here the trial of Charles I was held and a brass plate marks the spot where the King sat. The body of Edward VII lay in state in this Hall. \n\nFrom here we were driven to Buckingham Palace and places of interest pointed out on the way. We were shown over the King’s Stables, this being the second time I have visited the stables on this leave. – \n\nWe were then driven back to the Club passing the United States Embesey, and their Naval offices. We also passed the Duke of Wellingtons house, Lord Rothschild’s house which had the blinds drawn for Saturday is his Sunday. It was about 4.20 when we returned, and had a very pleasant trip for 3\/-. \n\nAt the House of Lords, I bought some photos of the King in civilian dress and in Uniform\n","2":" Jan 27, 1918, 1273\n\nI stayed at the War Chest Club last and was up early this morning at 5.30. had a good wash and breakfast and then left for Victoria Station to report at 7.30.\n\nWith others I arrived at the station in good time got our tickets stamped at the R.T.O. and were soon on board the train bound for Dover where we arrived at 10 minutes to 10. bought a feed at the counter in the large hall on the Pier, and after a long wait got on board a steamer being packed away like sardines, leaving the pier about 3.30. After the Steamer moved off we were allowed up and were soon at sea accompanied by two destroyers.\n\n We arrived at the pier at Calais about 6. P.M. and marched from there to No 3 rest camp, where after the usual wait we were alloted tents and then had a bread and jam tea with some cheese. We were\n\nsupplied with tickets for tea and breakfast. Then we drew our blankets and slept well until morning.\n","3":" Jan 28, 1918, 1274\n\nReveille, 6.a.m. Breakfast 6.30. Parade 7.30.\n\nAfter some delay we were marched to the station more than a mile away, then another long wait and we were aboard a train and passed through St. Omer and Hazebrook. Here there was a long wait for the train to Pouileul which did not go until 5.\n\nWe got out and had some fried eggs and bread. As a motor lorry was going to Baileul we got on board it and was in Baileul at 3.30. Later we caught another motor lorry in Baileul and was driven to within half a mile of Romarin – which place we heard the transports had recently shifted to. We arrived there before tea. \n\nThere were 13 letters waiting for me when I arrived. 1 from my father, 1 from Gavin Johnson 2 from my sister,and 8 from my wife. It took me a long time to get through them all. 1 from Kitty Martin. \n","4":" 1918, 1275.\n\nA beautiful day.\n\nBill Keiley returned early this morning. He was delayed by the boat coming from Ireland.\n\nHolmes is away on leave and Mathews is sick so I had to go on shoeing this morning. I shod two horses before dinner and one in the afternoon.\n\nSome of the attached men were sent back to their companies in the trenches tonight and as one of them was on picquet duty to night I was put on in his place – second picquet from 9 40 to 12.15.\n\nTonight Matthews was sent to the Hospital suffering from Influenza.\n","5":" 1276\n\nThere was a very heavy frost last night, but today the weather is beautiful. \n\nI was again shoeing today.\n\nTo night I wrote to my wife. 112. I also wrote to my Uncle J. Gilmore.\n","6":" 1918, 1277\n\nThere was another heavy frost last night and it was cold & cloudy all day. I was again shoeing to day. No papers came to hand today. The papers we got yesterday reported another air raid on S.E. England.\n","7":" 1278\n\nCold & frosty last night\n\nand cloudy all day with an inclination to freeze.\n\nShoeing again today. The papers report great strikes and industrial unrest in German industrial towns. This is the first day of February and it is current belief that the war is going to end this winter if not by the end of this month. I have some doubt about it, but I think it will end this year. The weather this past month has been much milder than this time last year. The month has slipped by very fast and pleasantly due in part my recent trip to England and Ireland and the weather being so mild and everything in the Transport running more smoothly than usual.\n\nFriday\n","8":" 1279\n\nA beautiful day. Cold & frosty last night.\n\nI put a full set of shoes on a mule driven by Bill Campbell this morning & in the afternoon got some shoes ready.\n\nThere were a few enemy planes about today but they were dispersed by our archies.\n","9":" 1280.\n\nA nice fine day\n\nI shod L.Kynes mule and the doctor’s horse this morning. There was the usual half holiday this afternoon and I stayed in and wrote some letters.\n\nYesterday H. Mc Donald and A. Johns were sent to the hospital. This makes three of the Transport men now in hospital. \n\nIt is officially announced that the total casualties in the air raid on Paris was 45 killed and 206 wounded.\n\nThis afternoon I wrote to my father, Kitty Gilmore and my sister, and Gavin Johnson, late of Dookie College.\n\nI received a letter from Tom Douglas this morning dated Nov.25. \n","10":" 1281\n\nA fine morning but cloudy. I am again shoeing today. A. Holmes came back from leave early this morning together with C. Charles, Deaveaux and others. \n\nI am again on picquet tonight. I was lucky enough to draw first picquet – 6 to 10 minutes past 9.The Battalion are now out of the trenches. They came out some time this morning. They are staying in the Catacombs.\n\nI am now reading a book called \"Freckles\" by Gene Stratton Porter author of \"The Harvester\". This is a very interesting book dealing with forest life in America. – birds, flowers, trees & timber getting. The hero of the story is an orphan boy called Freckles. \n","11":" 1282.\n\nFine but cloudy.\n\nI was again shoeing all day with A. Holmes helping me. It was mostly all draughts we were having today.\n\nThere has been constant artillery all day and to\n\nnight. The enemy has been shelling battery positions on our right all the afternoon. Their aeroplanes have been active, but were driven off and kept high by our archies. \n","12":" 1283.\n\nFine but cloudy. I was on grooming today. There was an inspection by the Colonel to day and everything was found in order & clean.\n\nI went down to the Hospital tonight and saw Mathews. He is getting on fine. While there I stayed for a concert given by the Periois which was very good\n","13":" 1284\n\nCloudy with occasional showers. I finished reading \" Freckles\" today. It tells of the growth of an Irish lad amidst the rough element of a lumber camp in the Indian Forest, & his friendship with both men and animals, more tender than all else, his romantic unswerving devotion to a lovely girl, who came from the fashionable world into the quiet of the Limberlost.(swamp of Indiana?) It is a fine story of a real hero, & pure souled son of nature, published by \n\nJohn Curry.\n\nI put on a spare pole carrier on one of the limbers this morning\n","14":" 1285.\n\nCloudy with occasional light showers\n\nAt dinner time today, I\n\nreceived a parcel from the residents of Cape Bridgewater sent by Griffiths Bros. containing the following.\n\n3 pkts. Spearmint, 1 cake chocolate, 1 tin plum pudding, 1 tin cake, 1 tin Mildura raisins, 1 tin short bread, 1 tin extract of meat,1 tin Turkey & tongue, 1 tin cheese, 1 tin butter scotch, 1 tooth brush, 1 tin shaving soap, 2 tubes tooth paste.\n\nI had given up all hope of the tin arriving, or rather the box for it was last November or early December that I was advised of it. It cost 2\/- to bring it from Victoria.\n\nToday I received two letters from my wife dated Nov.28, 100 & Dec. 2. 101\n","15":" 1286\n\nCloudy but fine.\n\nI was working most of the day at the 40. Bat. Transports blacksmith shop repairing hinges on the limbers.\n\nI finished reading a book \"Mrs Wiggs of the Cabbage patch\", an american tale of no special merits.\n\nI wrote a letter to Tom Douglas to night at the Y.M.C.A. in reply to his letter of Nov. 25.\n\nSunday Feb.10, 1918. 1287\n\nFine but cloudy.\n\nThere was the usual half holiday this afternoon, and I went for a walk. Bill Wilson & I got our photos\n\ntaken at a French shop down the road. We will call for the proofs on Wednesday. They will cost 8 francs a dozen.\n\nThen we went to the Hospital to see Jack Mathews and A. Johns. Mathews was sent away to the C.R.S. near Baileul while we were there, and Johns is to return to the Transports tomorrow.\n\nI received from H.G. Kittson to night – the \"Age\" of","16":" and a ¼ lb tin of Perfection tobacco \n","17":" 1288\n\nCold & cloudy also windy at 10 o’clock there was a heavy bombardment, and later our boys carried out a successful raid on the enemy. The 37th brought in a lot of prisoners (about 20). Our casualties are about 20. Mr Dickson & Mr Crowe are reported missing. Other Battalions in the Brigade did equally as well.\n\nI am fitting new brake screws on the Limbres today\n","18":" 1289.\n\nFine but cloudy.\n\nI am carrying on with the same work as yesterday. There will be at least another day’s work on the same job.\n\nI saw Dave Mc Kean this evening at tea time. He went into the trenches yesterday & got a note to day to report at the office and go to a N.C.O. school tomorrow for a month.\n\nThere is a series of concerts\n\nat the Y.M.C.A. \nto night\n this week but I have not been to any of them yet.\n\nI am again on a picquet to night. 4th picquet from 3.30 to 6.45\n","19":" 1290\n\nCloudy & showery all day. I was again fitting brakes on limbres and altering English brakes to fit Australian limbres.\n\nI got the proofs of the photos tonight. They are fairly good.\n","20":" 1291\n\nDull & cloudy, very muddy. I was again fitting brakes to Limbres today. Tonight I was at a concert in the Y.M.C.A. hut given by the Bandicoots. The first part of the programme was a picture show, the best item of which was the blundering Blacksmith.\n\nFriday Feb. 15, 1918. 1292.\n\nCold and frosty.\n\nI was working on Limbres all day. I finished the brakes and started making keys for the tail boards.\n\nI was at a concert to night at the Y.M.C. A. canteen given by the A.M.C. core of the 10th. Brigade.\n","21":" 1293.\n\nThere was a heavy frost last night, fully half an inch of ice on the water, which lasted all day. I spliced a broken pole in one of the limbres today. I received two letters from my wife today. 103. Dec10 & 102.","22":"\n\nThe enemy put over a \n\nnumber of high velocity shells this morning, some of them went right over our camp in the direction of Steinmerck, and I heard to night that they fell around the railway station there. \n\nSome fell east of our camp, probably in search of dumps.\n\nI received 2 \"Southern Cross\" tonight bearing a Merino Post mark, probably from Annie.\n","23":" 1294.\n\nThere was another heavy frost last night. To day is fine but cold. The sky is bright & clear. There was the usual half holiday today. I finished making a jug for Cliff Thomson today. I made a few days ago a flower vause for Harry Mc Donald. Both the jug & the vause I made out of 18 pounder brass shell cases. \n\nI finished reading a book \"Broken Road\" by A.E.W. Mason, a readable story of Indian life. It is a tale of an English man & an Indian Prince who were both educated in England and who as boys were great friends but later in life were enemies. The object of the book is to show that educating Indian princes in England makes them dissatisfied with their own people and unhappy because of racial distinction.\n","24":" -1295.\n\nCold & frosty last night the ice is over an inch thick. \n\nI am fitting new brake blocks\n\non the limbres to day. I did two yesterday morning.\n\nLast night a number of enemy aeroplanes came over dropping bombs in the vicinity of Baileul & again to night. I got some washing done by a Frenchwoman & received it to night. She only charged 8d for washing a shirt, towel & a pair of underpants.\n","25":" 1296.\n\nCold & frosty, but fine. \n\nI was again working on repairing Limbres all day. \n\nWe went for a bath in the afternoon but could not get any, as they had not been notified.\n\n Wednesday Feb. 20. 1918. 1297\n\nI was on picquet last night – 2nd second shift from 9.10 to 12.00.\n\nI had a good fire and made myself a cup of tea also polished a jug made out of a brass shell case for Cliff Thomson.. It was not my turn for picquet – but done it for A Holmes and received 5 francs for it.\n\nI am picquet to night, as it is my turn. I was unfortunate enough to get 3rd picquet 12.20 to 3.30\n\nTonight I received the photos from the French Photographer, 6 bust and 6 group. They are fairly good & cost 8 francs for the dozen.\n\nWe had a bath tonight just before tea.\n\nTwo of the hack men were sent to the hospital to day. \"Darky\" Tregenza, & \n\nand P.J. Ryan.\n\nI sent a photo of myself post card size to my wife to night, also one to my sister and one to my mother, and one to my nephew Eric \nEric\n Wilson and Tom Douglas, also a photo of Bill Wilson & myself to my wife, also one of myself to Mrs Gibson, Kish Ireland.\n","26":" Feb.","27":" 1298.\n\nA fine day.\n\nLast night I exchanged picquet and done the last from 3.30 to 6.45. I lit the cooks fire at 4 , made a cup of tea and called a number of officers & men who were going on leave, & also some transport drivers for early duty.\n\nOwing to a shortage of men for the hacks, I was put on grooming, and then finished the brakes on the limbres and also fitted a spare pole carrier to another. I delivered a jug to C. Thomson & a flower vause to H Mc Donald tonight. I am making two flower vauses for Valentine.\n\nThe enemy shelled one of our observation balloons this evening, but done no damage.\n","28":" 1299\n\nCold & windy.\n\nThis morning with others I was detailed to go to the Brigade to work. When we got there we found the job was to rebuild and repair a dugout that had fallen in. All the old sandbags had rotted away, and we had to fill up the earth into new bags. There were details from all the Transports in the Brigade Battalion. \n\nWe returned home for dinner & left off work about 3.30. The job will take about a week unless there are more men put on.\n\nYesterday we were paid, but I drew no money, am living on my souvenir money.\n\nWe all paid in for the cook to buy potatoes & other extraes. \n","29":" 1300\n\nA beautiful day.\n\nI was again at the Brigade repairing a dug out.\n\nI am 15 months in France to day. \n\nWe are to remove from this camp to morrow to\n\nFour men from the transports went on Blighty leave this morning.\n\nI received a letter from Kitty Martin today dated Feb. 18.\n\nTonight I went to a lecture given by Chaplain Mitchell on \"Queer things in animal life\" which was very interesting, and brimful of scientific facts.\n","30":" 1301\n\nA fine day, but cloudy.\n\nWe shifted from Romarin Camp this morning to another camp at Canteen corner about 2 miles away. The stables are very good but the huts are poor and there is only two for the transports. The Battalion also shifted today and are in huts alongside of the stables which means the Colonel will be buzing around every day. These billets were occupied by the 36 and they move into our old billets. We are only to stay here a \n\na few days when we are to go back for a rest.\n\nI saw Joe Carr to night in the Church Army hut. We had a long talk together about old times at the college & other students at the front\n","31":" 1302.\n\nShowery this morning. The roads are covered with thin liquid mud.\n\nI was grooming & cleaning saddles today.\n\nTonight Joe Carr came down from the artillery stables & with B. Dowden we had an interesting talk about old times & old mates at the college.\n\nLast night I saw L\/C. H.T Flugner of the 3 Battalion. He was at one time a schoolteacher at Dartmoor & Drik Drik.\n","32":" 1303.\n\nThere was a heavy frost last night, – consequently the roads were in good order this morning. The baloon which is stationed here ascended early this morning & the enemy sent 5 schrapnel shells around it, but done no injury to the baloon or to us.\n","33":" 1304.\n\nFine but cold.\n\nLast night I walked up to the artillery lines 108 Battery 8th Brigade to see Joe Carr, a driver there. I stayed until 9 P.M. To day I am painting Limberes. Today we were issued with Comfort fund boxes from Australia. My box\n\ncontained 2 tins of Havelock light tobacco, 1tin cocoa and milk, 1 tin figs, 1 tin soup cubes, a pair of laces 4 pkts. chewing gum, and a card from the donor Miss Maggie Anthony Kooyong Rd. Toora\nc\nk. Paddy Ryan came back from the hospital yesterday.\n","34":" 1305.\n\nI am two years in the army today, and over 15 months in France. It has been a long miserable 2 years & I will be glad when the war is over and I am back in civie clothes again. I have had a great experience since i left Victoria, and although I dont like soldering I do not regret joining up. I have always done my bit, and have seen a great deal of the world and its inhabitants both good and bad. One thing I am certain of, the army has not an elevating or ennobling influence but rather the reverse. There is great room for improvement in various ways. For instance I heard to day that owing to the great number of leave men who went A.W.L. all leave has been cut down from 14 to 10 days and the leave delayed. This a rotten principle as it punishes the innocent for the lapses of the guilty. Again if a man has lost an article or has something stolen, he is often told to \"pinch\" somebody’s. That is encouraging thieving, yet a thief if caught is severely dealt with. So thieves become cute and are difficult to catch.\n\nThere was a motor collision on the corner at our stables this morning. A motor lorry ran into a car standing in the corner, and broke the front axle of the car. \n\nI was cleaning & oil painting water carts & Limbres yesterday & to day.\n","35":"","36":"\n","37":" .1918. 1306.\n\nCold & frosty this morning and occasional flakes of snow during the day,\n\nThe U. boats have sunk 14 large ships last week & 4 small ones. The Huns have sunk another Hospital ship, Glenart Castle in the British Channel at 4. a.m. on Tuesday. She was outward bound & had all her lights burning. \"Should peace be concluded with Russia the Japanese Foreign Ministry says Japan will take steps of the most decided and most adequate character to meet the occasion.\"\n\nI was oil painting Limbres today. It was very cold work. We had an issue of green envelopes today.\n\nToday is the first of March and it looks as if we are going to have a bleak cold month.\n","38":" 1307\n\nA bitterly cold bleak windy day with some snow in the afternoon.\n\nWe are busy getting ready for a shift tomorrow. In the afternoon I was on a chaff cutting fatigue at the 28 stables.\n\nWe were given orders at 6p.m. tonight for to morrow and loaded\n\nsome of the limbres. Later these orders were cancelled. I was to take one of the pack mules & go by train, but this was cancelled & pack mules are to go by road. But as my mule is lame nothing definite is known. Revellie is at 6.30. a.m. tomorrow. \n","39":" 1308.\n\nCloudy but much finer than yesterday & not so cold.\n\nThe main section of the Transports got away by 10. a.m. this morning with the Sargeant & Mr. Boyland. The hacks & lame mules are to go tomorrow under charge of L\/C Borthwick, while the machine gun limbres are not to go until the machine guns are out of the line, probably tomorrow, when the limbres will move off on the 5 th. There is to be a big raid to night by another Brigade and another attempt made to blow up Warneton tower, which has been impervious to shells.\n","40":" 1309.\n\nWe left Canteen Corner camp about 10. am under charge of Mr Chapman. I started some time before with the 2 lame mules, but I was soon overtaken by the others. We arrived at Baileul railway station about 12, had dinner, when informed that our train was not in and would not be for some hours. About 5 to 5 we eventually got loaded up and away. It was a long miserable wait in drizling rain for the estaminet before which we were bolted \n\nclosed at 2. The train we left brought in another battalion to relieve us and then took us away to Wizerans where we arrived about 8.30 passing through Hasebruck on the way. In the meantime we had harnessed up our mules during the last half hour of the journey by candle light loaded the packs on them, & was soon off the train. It was decided that as my mules were too lame to travel 11 miles to our destination, I was to rug up feed them & stay all night at the station. I tied them to a water cart under a roof. Larry Kyne also stayed for the night as one of his mules was lame, and we camped in the goods shed. We had some bread & butter & paste, & then went to bed. A fatigue party from the HQ Batln. Also camped with us but they had neither food nor blankets.\n","41":" 1918.(Tuesday). 1310.\n\nMuch finer this morning. We woke up very late, had a little bread & margarine for breakfast. Pinched 2 sheaves of hay off a truck for the mules, yoked up & got away about 11. a.m. The railway yards at Wizerns are extensive and there are many British engines on the line, but most of the carriages & trucks are British. In the yard a gang of German prisoners in charge of an armed escort were shoveling gravel. They were all young fellows and seemed quite happy & contented.\n\nFrom Wizerns we travelled\n\nNot Transcribed (Postage Stamps)\n\nby road, making slow progress at first until the mules got warmed up. About a mile from Lumbres we caught up to our own transports who were balked for dinner. We had dinner fed our mules and were soon on our way again, going ahead of out Transports as they could travel much faster. About 3.30 we arrived at our destination a little tumble down village called Caulombes, just about 5 minutes before our transports arrived, they having travelled by a more direct route. We followed the main Baileul road too far. The back men were already here having arrived during the previous night about 3.a.m.\n\nThere were no stables big enough for us, and the horses & mules were billeted in old french stables in various parts of the town, like wise the men.\n","42":" 1918, 1311.\n\nA beautiful day.\n\nAll the morning at our stables was spent cleaning out the old stables & in grooming. There are 7 mules in the stables including my two lame ones Jenny and Warde.\n\nYesterday I rode Warde most of the way driving Jenny ahead of me as she was a bad leader. On one occasion she got broadside in front of a passing motor car, causing the car to haul up.\n\nThis evening we are cleaning our\n\nequipment in readiness for an inspection. I saw Bill Wilsons brother last night he is much younger than Bill. \n\nOrders came through today that 50 % of all employed men are to drill every day.\n","43":" 1312 day of the War.\n\n A fine day. I with others went out to drill this morning, with Head Quarters, and returned at 11. a.m. There was a lot of dissatisfaction in the Transports about drilling as the other work is neglected. Horses & mules were left ungroomed, and the stables dirty. Only a few men were left in camp when the drivers went out with their limbres. We were marched out to the Paradegrounds with the Polic & Pioneers and had Squad Drill. An officer to about every 10 men and Mr. Simpson over the lot. 4 officers for a little over 30 men. There is a surplus of officers in the Battalion & drilling gives them something to do. All transports\n\n"}}
