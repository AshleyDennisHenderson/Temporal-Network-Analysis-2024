a Pocket Diary & several pencils with the intention of keeping it posted while away. It is now certain we sail tomorrow. Most of our kit has allready gone & the orders are to fall in at 5 AM\n\nJune 17\n\nWe are well on the way but to start at the start – Were roused out at 2 AM yesterday & wonderfull to relate Coffee & Bread & Jam were on tap Fell in soon afterwards were given an embarkation card each & marched to the Station Arrived Sydney & lined up as the day broke & well not marched but wandered to Wooloomooloo Bay mixed up with the crowd of friends & relatives who had come even at at that early hour to see us off. There was no delay at the barrier & by 7 AM we were all on board\n\nHMT'S. A 72 formaly the P & O S.S. Beltand We were then payed up to date & at 10 pulled out from the Wharf which was imeditally crowded with the friends etc who had been locked out side There was a mixture of cheering & crying as the tugs pulled us out to the Bouy Another L\/C & self were detailed as guard for the gangway. Quite a number of boats & launches around to have a last word & was more disapointed than I would like to admit when at 12-30 we made a start & my people had not turned up\n\nThis was the start propper for the great adventure – What will it bring forth Wyh trouble about it – Dinner was our main consideration at the time – or rather the want of it. Eventually when we were well out at sea there was a call for Mess orderlies & we got a good meal the first for the day so most of us did it full justice & as there was a fair\n\nsea running seasickness soon held full sway & many a good soldier cared not for King & Country \n\nThis is my first time at sea but felt no sign of sickness except for a few minutes while in one of the holds helping the Q.M.S to issue blankets As night fell the sea got worse also the sickness. Things were cold & wet on deck so that soon after dark I faced going below got my hammock up & after a few experiments got settled into it most comfortably. But then the trouble started as soon as I closed my eyes it felt as if the old Boat stood straight up first on one end then the other with eyes open it was all right. However I was dead tired & before long was fast asleep & knew nothing more untill Revallie this morning What a place to awaken in. The Port holes & Hatch had been closed\n\nall night so there is some smell enough water has found its way in to wet the floor – in the lower end it is several inches deep – very many have been sick. Kit bags Blankets Books etc are lying all over the place so things are generally in a horrid mess & I wasted no time getting my bunk rolled up & getting on deck. Fortunately before breakfast came on everything had been cleaned up fairly well but it is a stuffy place & I suppose allways will be in rough weather as there is very little ventilation except the Portholes & Hatch. One thing with about half the mess sick there is plenty to care\n\nThere are 2 reinforcements in this Hold my lot (1st Pioneers) on one side & an Infantry reinforcement on the other about 300 men all told. But there is plenty of room as the place seems to be fitted for about 500. There are 2 small\n\nreinforcements in the next Hold in front of us & 2 to 300 Munition Workers aft They have better sleeping quarters & eat in what has been the","2":" Class Saloon & have waiters belonging to the ship to look after them\n","3":"\n\nWeather still rough & Cold The sick are recovering & the Mess filling up.

At 4.30 all troops were lilned up & I had to get 3 of my men with bayonets fixed to guard the Gangways that were not down as we were still 5 or 6 miles outside the harbour. After about ½ an hours messing about troops were dismissed & later lined up again as we entered the harbour more posting complaining sentries for me To end up with we anchored \nout\n in the middle of the harbour at dark\n\nwith no chance of going ashore.\n","28":"\n\nBeing the only N C.O on the Guard had no sleep last night. It seemed strange haveing the land close again. The new Guard came on at 9 a m as usual & about midday we pulled in to the wharf for coaling All troops were taken ashore & marched to the Town Hall about 2 miles on the way it rained the real stuff streams of it. In 2 minutes we were soaked But what did that matter we were on land miles of it to move about on after \nthe\n a month on the limited space of the old boat\n\nWent by tram to Toll Gate quite a pretty suburb. Got a good deal of fun out of the Ricksha Men & had several rides in them. Would not like to use them as a steady thing even allowing that the men are\n\nanimal pure & simple it seems a bit off to let them pull you about anyhow a horse can do it better. Had several meals dear & not particularly good but a change from the Ship\n\nThe only entertanement we could find was a picture show & it was crowded so took a rickshaw to the boat about 10 & made up for no sleep last night\n","29":"\n\nMarched to Town Hall & back to boat this morning. After dinner marched up again & dismissed for the afternoon. Used the Trams considerably. They are free to visiting Troops although several people have told me this is not a very loyal town But it is hard to get into conversation with most of the townspeople probably because our chaps are too familiar with the Blacks. There appear to be about 6 Blacks to one White so that \n\nnaturally the local people keep them under a great deal\n\nThere is a fine Paraide & Baths on the Ocean beach & some fine buildings in town\n\nFound a Mosque in a back street quite a handsome turnout It was open on one side so that we could see the whole show as Service was being held at the time.\n","30":"\n\nCoaling finished this morning. The work is done by Blacks more noise than work\n\nNative sellers of Fruit & Post cards did a great trade from the Wharf sending there stuff up by a basket tied on a string\n\nSeveral white people came & gave us a lot of fruit a Miss Cambell of the YM did most of it also took letters & P.C. to post. Sailed about 2 PM much cheering & cooeing Miss Cambell came\n\nto the end of the Breakwater & would flag signals. She can cooey some\n","31":"\n\nSome of the chaps thought they had reached the end of things last night by far the roughest we have experienced One life boat that is about 30 ft \npr\n above the water line at ordinary times got broken A lot of water got into our deck over a foot deep at one end of it & as quite a number sleep on the floor they had a bad time. Things were very mixed this morning with bedding hits etc floating about in the dirty water. I was luckie enough to get nothing wet to speak of.\n\nOnly one man left behind at Durban closing the Hotels probably saved some of the others\n","32":"\n\nWe are running fairly close to the \nshore\n coast. It is straight & rather uninteresting Mountains a short distance\n\ninland Passed East London yesterday evening \n","33":"\n\nTable Mountain sighted about 11 AM Anchored in Table Bay in the evening The A29 (Sunic) just beating us\n","34":"\n\nNothing doing all day except to look at the Town. It looks well between the Mountain or rather Mountains as there are 2 of them & the sea. Hope we have a closer acquaintance. Quite a lot of small fish have been caught The cooks are makeing quite a god thing by charging for cooking them. Fishing is evidently quite a business as I have counted 97 small boats all around us this morning\n","35":"\n\nWent into the Wharf this morning & Marched to the Town Hall. Were given strict orders to go about in parties of not less than 4. The Hotels\n\nwere open untill 12 oclock & as we were dismissed about 11.30 some of the lot I was with made the most of there time & got fairly full so Collier & I went off on our owne & had a look around town bought P.C. etc then took Tram to Camp Bay 11 miles the round trip The line runs out along the coast – some parts fairly high & returns through The Kloop between Lions Head & Table Mountain. As the line rises to 700 ft where it comes in sight of the Town One gets a splendid view of Town & Harbour\n\nThe Towns people are much more friendly than in Durban & there are not so many blacks. There is a fine Rest Hut where troops can get Tea Coffee Caikes etc for 1d each item also Reading & Writing rooms\n\nMost of the Town is very old fashoned with narrow streets good tram service\n","36":"\n\nMarched up Town at 10 A.M.\n\nWandered about untill lunch & then went to Camp Bay via the Kloop. This is the better way to go as far as sceniery is conserned for while the Town & in sight the Tram is ascending & travelling comparitively slowly. Traveling the opposite way one goes to fast to take it all in. Found a free Buffet & of course ait Went on the Pier in evening it seems t be cheefely for amusemet purposes\n","37":"\n\nWent through gardens rather small & not particularly good also through Museum a fine colection of stuffed animals especially Deer of all sorts & sizes never thought there were so many different kinds also good show of minerals. The plaster figures of native Bushmen are most life like & very interesting an interesting place but did not take time to\n\nexamin properly as we wanted to see Cecil Rhodes Home. Took train to Newland & walked to Groote Schuere Fine old fashoned old house. Built when people were not in a hurry set in very fine grounds. Quite a good Zoo. Australia is well represented & the ‘Roos etc look very well & have plenty of room. Went on to the Memorial It is some clime but well worth while one sees right down the valley over suburbs part of Town & harbour & out to see. The Memorial is plane & massive with a bronze Bust of Rhodes guarded by two huge lions There was a very takeing little Tearoom behind the Memorial \nof\n as usual we were hungary but were doubtful if we could finance a feed. Decided to risk it They did us very well & being quite cheap our cash stood the strain. Only have 6d left tonight & it is borrowed \n","38":"\n\nPut on Butchers fatigue this morning – Getting the days meat supply out of the freezing chamber – Also had to put a number of baskets of Lobsters in the freezer of course a basket got broken open – by an accident - & my fatigue did them selves well – but I did not feel very well after a complete lobster – Went up Town about midday. First to Picture Gallery nothing out of the way Next to Koofman De Wits Collection of Old Dutch stuff no thrills there Then found a Public Bath & had a reall hot bath one of the best things I have struck. The water is a dark brown but quite fresh Pay came to light (10\/-) this morning so the financial strain is lifted once more\n","39":"\n\nMoved out to anchor this morning\n\n& have remained here all day. It has been raining most of the time & most of us are sleepy after the last nights on shore As far as I could judge our chaps are quite popular here & this lot have behaved very well allthough from what I could gather some \nof\n former lots have not done so.\n\nThere were a lot of Portugus Soldiers on there way to Eias Africa in town. Fine sturdy chaps but very dopey looking\n","40":"\n\nStill at anchor Showery all day Two Parades. Fishing in full swing Cooks charde 3 each for cooking them\n","41":"\n\nGot the mud hook up at 1 PM & made a start – 5 troopers & escort HMS Apric quite an imposing line steameing out of the Harbour. No excitement this time. A few Helographs flashed messages\n\nfrom the Town & Hillside Formed into double line with Apric leading this afternoon. We are the center boat in the left hand line\n","42":"\n\nAm ships Orderly C\/pl today\n","43":"\n\nUsual programme. The sea is like glass & the six big boats just seem to be at anchor so well do they keep in line\n\nThe lines are about ½ a mile apart & half that distance between boats in line. Only one very small light shows on the stern of each boat No smoking is allowed on deck – a very necessary precaution as it is suppriseing how clearly one can see a lighted match or cigarette on any of the other boats\n","44":"\n\nPut Web Equipment – its really\n\nleather – in forward hold a good thing to have it out of the way. Did some washing. Lecture on Ropes & Splices Borderer did gun practice\n","45":"\n\nDeck Sports – Crew started putting up awnings\n","46":"\n\nHororata fined 3 shots. Practice I think allthough many believe it was a funeral. Lecture for N.C.O.s Map Reading. Concert in afternoon. The YMCA chap had tea with the 18th Btt & spoke to us afterwards. He is not a bad sort But hardly suited to his job. If he is going to improve us he certainly has plenty of scope for his energy. Clergy have not joined us at meals so far\n","47":"\n\nSports again today. A few nights ago some of the 1st forcibly bathed 2 of there chaps they needed it muchley\n\nby there looks it was the first wash since there mother used to do it & they were a fair age. Since then the rowdy element have been ducking any one they could get hold of. This went rather too far so the lot of them are pararded to the showers now\n\nTravers (YMCA chap) for tea tonight & one of the Pardries came down for a time Travers is trying hard to get us to cut out swearing. Its uphill work & some would not say much if they left the cuss words out\n\nA canvas ventilator has been put in at last. Fortunately port holes have been open & hatches uncovered since we left Capetown.\n","48":"\n\nThe Apic took a run on her own this morning was out of sight for a time This evening she sent up 3 small baloones & practiced on them with anti Air craft guns. Hit one\n\nThe awning is up over the forward well deck – great improvement Boxing contest on hatch – makes a good ring Also lecture by one of the Pardres on aft well deck. A very good speaker. He has just come from Palestine. Did not mention before we picked up several Pardries & Officers at Capetown coming home for leave also about 100 Tommies YM gave chocolates for tea. Getting quite warm\n","49":"\n\nYesterday the Corned beef at dinner was very hard to take so we got extra cheese – it was uneatable. Today the Dr condemed the pudding so it went overboard & was nothing to replace it – true economy. Fire & Boat drill Ballmoral castle had gun practice could hear the shells burst distintly A great many flying fish about. 1st day in the 4 year of War also my birthday \n","50":"\n\nStarted wearing shorts. It has been showery & overcast for some days today is bright but not unplestaly hot. Lectlure Why the Church is so Divided by Padre Knight a good speaker & has evidently studied a great deal. Ships Orderly C\/pl today\n","51":"\n\nStarted training for Physical Drill competion. A lecture by Captain Knight – Messopotamia. Our gun fired 4 shots all misses. We have crossed the Line at least 6 times in the last 48 hours according to roumer\n","52":"\n\nDid quite a lot of Physical Drill this morning & feel all the better for it. Lecture by Let Hart – The War in East Africa. He has been there for some time a poor speaker. Altered our course slightly more to the West. Our deck got first prize for cleanliness & 2nd for best table again\n","53":"\n\nThe Physical Drill competition came off today. The 18th won we got 2nd. This means a few shillings for our team I need it as my capital is one penny & a Kruger 2\/- piece that was palmed of on me in Capetown & can not be changed Boat Drill this morning. Quite an extcitement as we had no warning & there has been a lot of talk about Subs. While we were lined up the Pardres gave out 1 Pkt of Cigs between each 2 men Boats are all in one line tonight \n","54":"\n\nFormed in two lines early this morning & land was in sight anchored about 10.30 in Port Freetown Serra Leone. W Africa. It is very pretty a small white town close to the water with wooded hills behind Every thing is beautifully green right to the waters edge. There are no wharfs to speak of & the anchorage has very\n\nlittle shelter – just a big Bay like the of a circle let into the coast & there is a Submarine net running across about 1 mile out\n\nPlenty of Niggers about in there \"Dugouts\" Diving for coins & selling fruit\n\nMunition Workers won the Tug o war Concert on deck at night\n","55":"\n\nWet & miserable all morning but not as hot as one could expect. We are filling our water tanks from barges alongside & coaling the niggers making more noise even than at Capetown Four boats came in from England today. Officers went on shore Quite a number sleep on deck now Have not tried it myself as there are often showers at night & one has to beat a retreat below & my hammock is hung in a good place opposite the gangway so there is nearly allways some breeze. Smoke Boxes have been\n\nput on board. They are for throwing over board to make a Smoke screen in case of Submarine attack\n","56":"\n\nStill admireing the green cain wood verdure of Serra Leone. Coaling has been finished & we are free from dirty niggers. Most of our chaps make the great mistake of being too familiar with them. Treat them as equals & expect them to remain niggers\n","57":"\n\nAbout 10 A M our old escort HMS Apric went out with 4 boats to Capetown We followed & turned the other way There are 9 boats in our lot now including a Battle ship & Aux Cruser Not sorry to be on the move again as we were not allowed on shore at Serra Leone. A fresh order has come out we have ot wear Life belts day & night. They are not comfortable also anything that will float is not \n\nto be thrown overboard in the day time. Usual Services Was on Guard this morning but the Submarine Guard was started again so only did a few hours. No more bugle calls are to be sounded. YM gave us chewing gum \n","58":"\n\nTrouble about tucker today. It was rough. The Convoy does not keep the same formation now changed several times today We are running last in the left row tonight The cruiser has been out scouting all day. Sports this afternoon. Our O.C. (Lut Garnesy) is in hospital after his day out at Serra Leone\n\nThe Sub Guard have started well one chap let his rifle off by mistake just missed the Sgt who was inspecting & put a hole through a water pipe another \ncha\n shot the reflection of a Star in his zeal to straff the Hun\n","59":"\n\nMuch as usual. Tucker improved grilled chops replaced our old friend Stew for breakfast. A lecture by an RFC Lieutenant on Flying Machines & Flying very interesting Physical Drill class got going properly again\n","60":"\n\nMuch cooler Awnings all taken down again. The ventilator has also been taken out makes it much hotter at night. Have tried to get it put in again but no one seems to care enough about it to do anything\n\nThe Cruiser caused some excitement today. She was about 3 miles away to Port when she suddenly started fireing & manuvering at top speed We could see what she was fireing at & most thought it was a target the more imaginitave swore it was a Sub. Some could even see the oil on the water where it sunk. Several chaps have moved there hammocks\n\nnearer the steps to be able to get out quickely in case of a n attack. I have about the posisition. I thinjk there are very few who worry much about Subs\n","61":"\n\nThe last 24 hours have been a bit rough the first time there has been a ripple on the water since leaving Capetown\n","62":"\n\nThe Convoy has done quite a lot of manuvering today. Made a complete circle once & we have changed our course several times The 17th Batn were payed 2\/- each yesterday. Orderly Cpl today. The number on sick parade seem to increase or diminish in proportion to the amount of stuff sold at the Canteen & one can form a good idea of the financial possition by the quantity of rubbish \n th\n of cigerette\n\nchocolate boxes about the Deck. Seeing that the sweepers do there work is part of the Orderly Cpl duty\n","63":"\n\nWere to be payed 8\/- today. Had to sign for 10\/- 2\/- being held to cover shortages in ships stuff such as knives forkes hammocks etc. These cannot be made up untill we land & should not come to more than 6d each. There was so much dissatisfaction over signeing for more than was received that it has ended by not getting any pay at all Identification Discs issued today. Now one cannot go to an unknown grave Boxing tourniment \n\nFinished today\n","64":"\n\nChurch Parade morning\n\nLecture singing etc afternoon Traners of the YM gave out chocolate at tea time & has just delivered a short sermon & given us each a Testement. I think\n\nhis talking has had some affect on the swearing He is an energetic sort of chap but not very sutable for his job.\n\nIt has been a beautiful day of bright warm sun & wonderfull blu sea with just a ripple on it. Not allowed below during the day now in case of Subs.\n","65":"\n\nWe got the 8\/- today in spite of all the growling Have payed the Mess orderlies off & 2 copies of The Beltance Bugle \/ The paper we had printed in Capetown 1\/- just cut it out A cruser passed early this morning & a steamer a long way off this evening – she looked a lonely little speck. Sports on Deck in afternoon The sea is calmer than I thought possible\n","66":"\n\nPassed another steamer this morning\n\nGot our water bottles out again & have to carry them full of water continuesly – Why not rum.\n","67":"\n\nParaided in Full Marching Order this morning Got my cash from orderly room that I deposited there leaveing Sydney feel very wealthy. Passed a small steamer this morning Strong W wind & a fair sea running. A list is being made out of the Trades we followed or work we have done in civilian life. My list is a long one\n","68":"\n\nFair sea running & much cooler but am still wearing shorts. After many false alarms the Destroyers – 8 of them turned up about 2 PM quite a thrill for us We should certainly be safe now cannot say I have ever felt otherwise No Paraides Orders are we disembark at 2 PM tomorrow\n","69":"\n\nYesterdays order was a bit out as it is now dark & no land in sight. Have put our blankets & hammocks away & have kit bags & equipment out all ready for landing Sea rough Passed 5 small steamers\n","70":"\n\nSlept in the Orderly room so was better off than a good many but spent rather an uncomfortable night not being used to the floor & having no blankets. Land was in sight at daylight & by 7 oclock we were anchored off Plymouth Every boat even little \nsail\n fishing one seem to be armed & mostly have wireless Destroyers seem to be every where Saw a seaplane for the first time No time was lost (considering we are in the army) in disembarking One big barge took the lot & landed us right at the train. It was a great for all old hands & new & if it\n\nis a fair sample of English weather there is nothing to complain of. The country is lovely just ijke a picture book or Landscape Target. Little fields green while & yellow narrow well made roads fat sleepy looking stock old stone houses many thatched exactly as one expected only rather more so.\n\nThe Mayoress of Exeter gave us each a bottle of Tea & a bun about 3 PM most acceptable as it was all we were able to get (there were rations on the train but through lack of experience on the part of our Officers they were not given out) Arrived Denton about 7 PM & marched about 2 miles to Forent Camp The last bit was up quite a steep hill & we were mostely done up by the time we reached the top. By then it was quite dark & our first greeting to an English camp was to hear Defaulters at the double \n\nAfter a bit of messing around to Headquarters Etc we got Tea consecting of 2 slices of bread each margarine & Blancmange & Tea. We only had Mess tins or clash brunes so Blancmange was rather slipery stuff to handle but it did not go to waste\n\nWere issued with 3 blankets & allotted to tents with board floors Kitbags were left at the railway\n","71":"\n\nNot the bright England of yesterday heavy clouds & showers all day. This camp is on a gentle slope – one side of a valey the opposite side was abruptly for fully 300 ft. On the side of this hill there are quite a collection of Regimental Badges & designs made by cutting away the turf & exposeing the clean white chalk that is only covered by a few inches of soil. An immense \"Rising Sun\" is cut out opposite here – very well done. A outline of Australia & a Kangaroo further up\n\na Stag & other designs down the other way. Had a good breckfast. Medical examination. Inoculation Issued with Kits. Got nicely fixed in Tents & had to move into another lot\n","72":"\n\nRained nearly all day. Felt very much off colour so stayed in bed as there were no parades. It is a muddle place\n\nWednesday\n","73":"\n\nWind & Rain all night. Blew some tents down – not mine fortunately – Had a bad night being stiff & sore from lying on the boards for the last 18 hours. Moved into huts this evening, great improvement. We are supposed to be isolated for some weeks after leaving the Ship. It is only supposition as we go about as we like. There is a Guard around our line of huts & they are often the only men to be found there. Feel fairly right again & had a decent\n\nfeed in a little shop near the camp first since Sunday\n","74":"\n\nVery little doing today Rained most of the time. Received a letter from Leo W from France Went for a walk this evening through rustic lanes & Ye olden Village (Fornak) It is all very pretty – but so old Our camp is the only new looking thing I have seen I wonder people have gone to so much trouble in this country if the last few days are a fair sample of the climate. But things seem to grow well & that is the main thing \n","75":"\n\n A fine day so started work in earnest The methods are better than they were at Liverpool must not say too much untill I have seen more of them One thing the man are all keen to do there list. We have heard so much about how hard & smart the training is here that we are all keen to shew what we can do. Then getting new N.C.Os \nmakes\n (we have all taken our\n\nstripes down) makes a difference. The meals are good & plentyfull. Bought a fountain pen should have written more lately but have not felt up to it a few days work will fix me up\n","76":"\n\nHave had a day up as I was on Picquet last night. Beautifull day \n","77":"\n\nOn Fatigue. Moved out of Isolation Issued with straw beds much appreciated Concert at YM not much good\n","78":"\n\nChurch Parade Poor sort of Padre Went for a walk in afternoon. There is no where special to go & you see no one but soldiers\n","79":"\n\nAs usual. On Picquet in evening at a little Hotel about 2 miles away Just the sort of place one reads about even to the oldest inhabitant But it was over run with soldiers\n","80":"\n\n2nd inoculation Issued with new pay books\n","81":"\n\nPayed 15\/- Sports at Hurdcot another camp about 2 miles away. They were very good but it was hard to get a place where one could see decently as there was a great crowd\n","82":"\n\nThe inoculation is a good scheme have had all day off so have done nothing gracefully Quite hot. Some of the lads gambled by match-light untill after midnight & have been at it all day They will be broke tonight which is well\n","83":"\n\nUsual training a \n7\n very good Conjuring intertainment in YM\n","84":"\n\nWas put in Sanitary Staff today. Digging a rubbish pit. Went to Village in evening One can get very nice Plums very cheaply\n","85":"\n\nRain as usual Went for a walk\n","86":"\n\nFine day The Sanitary pit is supposed to be perminent. Two of us have to clean the Grease traps at the cook houses We had them all done by about 10 oclock but found out it was supposed to be an all day job so kept out of the Sgt sight\n","87":"\n\nAs usual\n","88":"\n\nGot another chap to take my sanitary job & went on Parade. Fireing on Munitune Range Scored 18 – 25. Collier & I went to next camp to see the Conjurer again He was very full tonight\n","89":"\n\nAs usual told we are to get Disembarkation Leave on 25th This has been a burning question ever since we landed & there have been many rumours as to when \n&\n we would get it & for how long\n","90":"\n\nAs per usual. The Physical Drill is Bayonet Fighting in the forenoon is far the best part of our Drill. The instructors are picked men have been well trained & are keen on there work so they keep us up to the mark. The Musketery is just the oppisite do as little as possible & do it anyhow. It's a tyresom old subject \nat best\n We have to unlearn a good deal that we learnt at Liverpool\n","91":"\n\nRought March about 10 miles felt like 20 as we had packs on & it was the first long walk since landing The roads are hard for ones feet & in many places just wide enouh for 4 to get along – supposed to be 10 ft – It was a bright warm morning & the high hedges \nmak\n shutting off any breeze made it rather too warm at times Went for a walk with Baker in afternoon about 5 miles for exersise.\n","92":"\n\nChurch Parade\n","93":"\n\nPicked for Guard this morning This means doing a bit of Guard training in the morning & \nthen\n you have the afternoon off to get equipment etc ready Mount at 4 PM I was picked as being the best dressed so am let off Guard & am \nto\n Battalion Rumer for tomorrow It is a very wet night so am rather pleased to off Guard\n","94":"\n\nThe first run I got was to Hurilcotte with orders on an old Bike & was kept going fairly well all day. There are 4 perminent men on this job & the one new one each day – He gets the worst of it. If any of the clerks in Orderly Room have a message to send they call Runner & you go in & they say ‘Here take this. If the Major wants it done He comes out & says Will you take this to so & so please\n","95":"\n\nDid 15 minutes PT then it rained & kept on most of the day Concert in YM Quite good Payed 10\/-\n","96":"\n\nAs usual. Never knew a Hut to be so quiet on a pay night must be saveing up for leave\n","97":"\n\nAs usual Good Concert & Aussie letters\n","98":"\n\nRought March. Started off over the Hill opposite the camp quite a stiff climb about 10 miles along open roads. Did not feel it at all today Concert in YM much higher class than any I have been to before\n","99":"\n\nOpen Air Service today. Went up hill opposite camp & examined Rising Sun & other Badges. They are made by cutting the turf off & filling in the trench thus\n\nformed with lumps of clean chalk. As the chalk Is only about 4 from the surface it is easy to get. The Sun is about 50 yds across the base & very accurately layed out. Had a very good tea in Village Ham & Eggs Tea Bread & butter 1\/8 yr\n","100":"\n\nSome little insects were found in our Hut this morning They are off the cabbages growing between the huts But it got about that they were lice so we have got a fresh supply of blankets & the hut has been disinfected.

The most important part of our Kit seemed to be a piece of white cord to fasten the ends of the blanket to the haversack.

One of the big American liners was moved to the wharf being fitted as a trooper for the Yanks & 3 or 4 of went over her She is a very fine boat & they will have fine quarters. Four 6 in guns are being mounted on her so she will be able to protect herself We embarked about 6 oclock & had to get off again soon after & marched out to a Rest camp about 2 miles Issued with 3 blankets & put in a fair night. There is a lot of fun in being on Draft. The majority are\n\nJan ‘18\n\nold hands who have been to France before & are bent on all the fun they can get out of the last few hours on this side There is a good deal of drinking allways is traveling & all moves in the army to quote Omar Khayyam \"What without asking hither hurried.

Hunted all over the place & could not find a decent posie It is a dead calm night so no sickness Have done well for tucker could buy bread & tea or cocoa from the sailors & had plenty of ‘billie' The engins have just stopped 4.15 AM so suppose we are at Le Harve\n","212":"\n\nDisembarked about 9 a m & marched 3 miles (must call them miles now) to our Base Depot Had a good meal & were issued with the ballance of our kit Waterproof sheet & cape combined Rifle Tin Hat & I had enough to carry before What we saw of Harve it is a livly old place\n","213":"\n\nIssuing the extra Kit yesterday was done more expeditiously than anything of that kind I have struck in the army.

Had to sleep in the YM Picture Show last night Saw the pictures first & then slept the sleep that is issued to small children & soldiers Had a march about 6 miles with full wads – No we have no ammunition – It was quite hot & the troops felt it. One has to put on a lot of clothing for the morning & after \nt\n you have marched a while with the Sun shining you warm up some. The tucker here is the best I have struck in the Army. Went to pictures to fill in time before turning in\n","214":" & Sunday 27\n\nLeft camp about 9 a m fully loaded this time ammunition & dry rations - & marched to the railway at Le Harve between 5 & 6 milea a very bad road & as it was hot it took a lot out of us. The train did not leave untill afternoon We were packed 32 in a cattle truck just enough room to lie down by fitting in close Tea was supplied about 9 & there was plenty of butter buscuits Jam & cheese in each truck. Put in quite a good night & have traveled slowly with many stops Detrained at Castre & marched about 2 miles to a small camp getting there just at dusk & were alloted to tents & given an extra blanket. The country is very flat & uninteresting as far as I have seen. Saw a few shell holes about Hasellbrock a fair sized place few miles back The only reall signs of war so far\n","215":"\n\nWent for a very short march this morning without packs. Can hear\n\nthe guns from here at times & saw some shell bursts around a Plane this morning & some last night but they were a long way behind us\n","216":"\n\nLeft Castre at 9.30 a m & marched to Batilion Head Quarters about 12 or 14 miles – no packs- crossed the Border into Belgium about half way. There has evidently been no fighting about here lately came through one small town that has been complately destroyed Roads we had in places but mostly fairly good. As we were mostely new men we were detailed to the different Companies I went to A Co so had to march back about 2 killos with pack up it was the last straw allthough cannot say I have felt the march greatly today. Got a plentyfull issue of good tea & made a substantial meal Have a Bow hut to sleep in The country is very wet & muddie anywhere of the roads - & often on them \nWed 30th\n The weather is beautiful & quite warm\n","217":"\n\nAllotted to NH Platoon 14 Section & had to march about 4 miles on to where they are camped at St Eloi or rather where St Eloy has been as it is hard to find a compliete brick let alone a piece of wall standing Thompson & Bill in this platoon. We have been together right through &they are both good mates An \nother\n old hand – Proso – is with us have spent the afternoon making a \"dugout\" with buiscuit tins full of dirt & bow iron pinched from a R E dump close by. It will be quite the \"Home\" when finished room for 2 bunks on each side & about 2 ft of space down the centre & just high enough to stand upright The country is all shell holes full of water old trenches wire & all kinds of rubbish. About 100 yds away on the crest of a ridge are some imense mine craters fully 30 to 40 ft deep. There are a great many guns about that do a lot of fireing but so far no shell have come near us They say we are 3,000 yds from the front line\n","218":"\n\nWent to our job a concrete Observation Post & did a shift this afternoon about 6 hours Foggie for a change\n","219":"\n\nSame as yesterday\n","220":"\n\nShift changed now go out at 6 AM & return at noon. The old hands say this is a very good job all day work.

It makes no difference they are all much alike. Do our bit of work & sometimes go to a Canteen or YM – there are several not very far back – where you can buy nourishment – Buiscuits Tined stuff Candles & sometimes eggs. Beer is the chief article of the Canteens But we 4 are not drinkers. In fact it is often hard to get through our Rum ration. Thomson & Bill don't tutch it so Pross & I have a double share. It is very strong stuff & would be excelnt to fight on. Rum & today wind (not pleasant\n","226":"\n\nNothing startling\n","227":"\n\nAs usual untill just before we knocked off Fritzie put some shell on a South African Battery about 100 yds behind us. Hit a gun first with one of the first lot. A few of the Gunners were about & they made a dash for there Dugouts Next salvo one man ducked up to his neck in a \n\nshell hole he scrambled out & got about 10 yds away when a shell burst in the hole he had lust left. This was all great fun for us But the range was shortened & we got them one or two quite close It was our turn to duck & someone elses to laugh. It was all over in about 10 or 15 minutes & no one hurt. These are the first shell that have burst any way close to me so far. One or two Hun Planes over this evening so we will probably get more shells in a day or so\n","228":"\n\nSame job.

It is all dumped about 4 or 500 yds from us & we have to put it on track & push it along to the job. Today I was getting it when along came an Officer & started to \"Roar\" because he sayed I was taking his gravel. I argued for a while & moved on to another heap (there were several heaps close together) Was not there long when the same thing happened again so went to a very small heap right at one end - of course the idea is to get the easiest shoveling – Was hard at it when a Canaidian Officer came. He was so nice about me takeing his one & only little heap that I went back to the other. Of course some of it is or should be ours & anyhow it is all \n\nfor the same purpose. But it seems such a haphazzard way of doing things, every thing else appears to be done in the same way & yet there must be a wonderful organization behind it all\n","233":"\n\nWork. Some gunners have their cookhouse beside our job & we often get a drink of tea from the old cook. Poor old chap got badly burned today. He had some cordite for lighting his fire & it caught alight. The place was full of flame for a few seconds & he was in it. We also use cordite as kindling & had several bags in the Dugout. We are keeping it outside now.

Creamy curry powder, Soup cubes Ham Paste, Boot laces Chocolate & Chewing Gum Each man got one & there was some difference in them all\n\nSunday 17th\n\nWork. A couple of H.E. shells dropped close to our job just before we left. A lot of Arial Activity today. Fritzie got well over our lines several times & got abay allright. One of our machines came down – hit with one of our own shells I believe\n","236":"\n\nStill working. Fritzie came over per Plane the same as he has been doing for some days but did not get back\n\n5 of our Planes came out of the Heavens There was some circling & machine gun fireing & Fritz was gradually forced down & plunged headlong the last few hundred feet As it happened just at knock off some of us went over to see the machine. It had landed on the side of the Canal & was a compleete wreck. The pilot was not dead but badly broken up. The first freshly wounded man I have seen. This evening one of our Planes caught fire when at a great height & came down like a meteor Hear that the Pilot was only scorched a bit but \"ha ma doubts\"\n","237":"\n\nPross rejoined us\n","238":"\n\nAs usual.

They were good practice for the Machineguns\n","249":" ","250":"\n\nWent out in evening to start a new job It is about 2½ miles away on what is left of \"Hill 60\". We are sayed to be 1800 yds from the Huns front line & as he has a good view of our job it is to be all night work It is a concrete Machine gun post this time not such a large affair as the last one No material had been sent up so we did very little & got home about 9 PM Just got to bed when our guns started in earnest & He replied putting a good deal of\n\nshrapnel & H E in & about our camp. Our humpie rocked a good deal one piece of stuff hit the roof but did not come through & Pross who is an old hand decided it was better to clear out so we hopped out of bed & started down the road. Bill & Thompson got mixed up on some shell holes as it was very dark & went back but Pross & I got into a dug out about 30 ft deep we know of about 200 yds away a wretched wet shop it was allthough a few men are kept there allways pumping it out Most of the show was over by the time we got there so it was not long before we back in our dry beds again. No one was hurt allthough some had narrow escapes. Have heard since it was a Hun raid & we captured the prisoners as our barage stopped them getting back to there lines \n","251":"\n\nWent out to the job about 9 & got some stuff together a cold windy day with a little snow\n","252":"\n\nSame as yesterday\n","253":"\n\nOn the job for about 3 hours a dark wet night \n","254":"\n\nWeather has cleared up again.

Started again & once more he put his shells in us for the Tunnel again. Got to work again & finished off quick & lively Another chap & I were the last to leave as we were fixing the camoflage. Were covering a truck on the Tram line when \"plunk\" a gass shell dropped only a few yds away. We ran for it & the next one dropped just behind my mate it keeps us \nmovaling\n moveing. Just then the shells started falling fairly thick right on the track in front of us so we stopped untill they steadyed down Then we put on our Gassmasks as there seemed to be quite a cloud of gass in one place & got through without any trouble. In fact it does not seem very dangerous stuff if one puts his mask on in time Not as bad as the High Explosive shells. Even with them \nthere\n it is largely a matter of luck as they can burst very close & do no harm on the other hand you may get hit quite a distance away\n","259":"\n\nA change of programe went out at 10 Pm\n\nMarch\n\n& 3 of us stayed untill 3 PM putting in the iron rods to reinforce the concrete a \nn\n bit dificult in the dark.

It was hardely a fair deal but as I have been drinking it am as much in it as anyone\n","263":"\n\nSteady rain all morning Night shift as usual\n","264":" Worked in afternoon for a \n\nchange taking stuff – sand cement etc – up to the job. We put 2 or 3 trucks on behind a Ford motor fitted with railway wheels & take it up fairly close to the job & the shift going out to work push them the rest of the way. It is hard work especially the last few hundred yds where it is a branch line & very badly laid\n","265":"\n\nAnother day shift getting material\n","266":"\n\nAll hands went out in evening & finished the main part of the job by 10 PM. Had to stop work twice on account of Gas shells. As things were a bit lively were sent home in pairs. My mate & I were about ½ way back when he started putting over a lot of mixed stuff. We were just nicely in front of it only ducked once But things livened up at the camp after we got there mostely gas some H E one 6 in burst about 6 yds from our door. Had just made some cocoa & started feeding \n","267":"\n\nwhen we got orders to put our masks on & go down the road. Most of the show was over by then but we had to hang about for fresh orders (Fortunately we had the cocoa etc with us) Eventually we had to get our blankets & go about a 1 mile to where the remainder of the Company is camped got there about 3 Am & was luckie enough to strike a humpe with a couple of old mates in it & got a good camp for what was left of the night All told 16 men were gassed out of my platoon only 2 or 3 any way severly Cant say I even smelt it.\n\nMonday 18th\n\nWent back to our camp early & had a day off to recuperate\n","268":"\n\nThe P;atoon or rather what is left of it went on Bath Parade. An excelent bath & good change of clothes Rained nearly all day the wettest I have seen in this country\n","269":"\n\nFour of our men went out this morning to put the finishing touches to the job. I had to make the concrete inside look pretty by sticking mud in any little cracks & holes reminded me of my childhood makeing mud pies & just about as usefull. The Major came along. He did not like the job some of it badley done & to a certain extent he is right. Several nights while we were working the concrete would freese while hung mixed & putting in reinforcements in the dark is no easy matter but even allowing for that some of the work could have been better. This M.G. Post was a half circular construction butting on to an old Hun Pill box. It is about 6' high inside & the same in diameter with walls about 2' thick & roof 4' thick solid concrete. We have had to make most of our own frames out of any thing we could find so that naturally the inside is rough\n","270":" On acount of the majors\n\ncomplaints our tent took a party out at 3 AM to put things right. But they got caught in a barrage – mostly gass – about half way out & had to spend some hours in a dugout then came home without doing anything 2 or 3 got gassed slightly & have been evacuated. A few shell came about the camp but no damage was done. Have done nothing all day \n","271":"\n\nWent out at 6 a m & nearly finished the job. Quite a hot day.

The rest of Platoon started on a new job yesterday.\n","274":"\n\nUnloaded some trucks this morning Moved camp in afternoon about 1 mile back to where the remainder of a Company are camped. The four of us managed to secure a dugout on our own again. It is a miserable little afair not nearly as good as the one we built at our last camp Managed to get hold of some good bunks & have made our selves quite comfortable Yesterday was quite hot today the reverse A lot of rumours that we have had a big reverse about Bapume. Hope they are untrue\n","275":"\n\nWent out at 7 a m in a motor transport. Very crowded rough trip. Started excavating for the new job – another M.G. post – It was a very clear day & we had a good view over the Hun lines. Do not know whe we are working here in the day time as the Hun must be able to see us quite planely \n","276":"\n","277":"\n\nWalked out to job about 3 miles. The Sgt in trying to pick a safe road chose about the worst one as he (the Hun) could see us close but no harm done. A few shells while working.\n","278":"\n\nHave missed a day as I believe it is Good Friday. The only way we have of telling the days is Tob issue on Sunday Matches on Thursday Worked in 2 shifts today I went out at 7 a m Things seem to be going against us in some parts The yarn now is we go to the Somme in a few days Though this would be a nice quiet camp – in fact we were moved here for safety but a few big ones dropped close yesterday & again this evening\n","279":"\n\nWent to the job untill about 11 AM After getting home fell in for inspection with full packs to see that all was ready for the move to the Somme.

Bill was outside near the back & got a hit in the leg & a scratch on one ear. Walked about ½ a mile to dressing station at Vormassle. Fresh bandages were put on & because I colapsed for a moment was made into a stretcher case & started right away with several others per car.

Sweep & clean the Hut up & see that every thing is put away correctly – Nearly every camp has a slightly different idea as to how blankets should be folded & other things arranged There is usually a ‘Blueprint' illustrating the correct method on the notice Board One makes it look all right on the outside & shows all odds & ends under\n\nthe blankets To have all windows & doors open is the great thing here.

Being on Draft have just mucked about all day \nF\n There was a free Picture Show for us this afternoon Did not go as I wanted to do some writeing Fell in about 7 PM usual rool calls & inspections \"Two up\" being played on every possible chance. Just as we were about to move off 2 other Pioneers & self were told to \n\nfall out & were dismissed. Have no idea why it was done but as it has turned out a very wet night & I have rather a bad cold am rather glad allthough it means going through the whole performance again next week\n","369":"\n\nWas transferred to A Co as they send the next draft. Put in all day \ndoing it\n going there It took us quite half an hour\n","370":"\n\nUsual Parades but as there was a good deal of rain put in most of our time in the shelter sheds. This is the first decent rain for some time & it was badly needed The wheat crops about here are very good not very high but big well filled heads\n\nApplications were called for a Machine Gun school so put in am not very keen on it but it seems about the only way to get another 4 days leave & I am keen on that\n","371":"\n\nParaded in morning to give in Overseas Kit & draw UK Kit afternoon C.O. inspection etc\n","372":"\n\nMessed about all morning Got a weekend Pass Went to Sutton V – picked up Hall & went to Pictures.

The rifle men concentrate rapid fire on the trench while the 2 Gunners advance about 50 yds on one flank Then they open fire while the sections advance live amunition was used also smoke boms which did not seem a great success Quite an interesting show & hard work for the men doing it\n\nThis is St Whitins Day & if it rains – it has very slightly – leagon says it will be wet for 40 days. They say it was so last year – The leagon is that St Whitins who was Bishop of Winchester was buried in the Church Yard & it kept on raining for 40 days untill some bright chap buried him inside the church & the wether was fine once more.\n","375":"\n\nThe M Gun Draft left early this morning without me rotten luck. We were all supposed to be in one Hut but as the others went in to it on Sunday while I was away knew nothing about it, Went sick\n\n& have been isolated as I have Scabies just an irritable rash. Have had \nto\n a bath well disinfected & rubbed all over with \na\n ointment mostely sulphur. We live & get our meals in \nthe same\n a hut by our selves & do no parades but can go about as we like. Three men came in today from Loose one of the Military prisons sayed to one of the strictest but none of them seem to complain in fact rather enjoyed it. It seems to be the correct thing in the army to tell all about your crimes in fact rather to glory in them & in many cases a Military crime does not amount to much & plenty of decent fellows get into quod. These chaps have not been allowed to talk & are making up for it now One thing I have noticed with men coming from \njail\n a 3 or 6 months \"stretch\" they are in the pink of condition The regular meals & exercise does it also no drink & very little tobacco\n","376":"\n\nMess Orderly not much work attached to it. Have bathed & greased myself twice today. Was awake a long time last night & it was like being in a big rat hole to hear the others scratching The irritation has almost left me \n\nJust been to quite a good lecture by an Indian. There was nothing very special in it but he spoke well & brought in many funny stories so it went off well\n","377":"\n\nOnly one greasing today The AMC Cpl who is in charge of this turn out is a rum little bird very serious & most particular about the treatment He seems to have studied the Scabie It appears it is a minute insect & was introduced into this country by the mules from S. America. It is this insect burrowing into the skin that causes the infection. Walked to \n\nJuly\n\ntraining camp & went with Hall to some very good pictures\n","378":"\n\nHad a bonnie bath & turned out of Isolation Drew Oversee Equipment & was put into C Co for the Draft next Tuesday\n","379":"\n\nFell in with full packs for inspection our Dead Meal Ticket were the only thing inspected to see they were stamped properly.

It is about ½ mile from the jump off to the objective & it has to be done in rushes of 30 to 100 yds. One is in full Battle order with 120 rounds ammunition & 2 Bombs I was clean done by the time I reached the last trench & could not have put up much of a fight it it had been a dinkum go Kit inspection in afternoon\n","382":"\n\nAs it was raining hevily when we fell in this morning the Colonel sent us straight to our Huts instead of going about 1 mile to throw live Bombs as we should have done. Did nothing all day & fell in at Y.M & moved off about 8 for Warminster it is a good 5 mile march by the road we took The YM gave us a drink of tea & biscuits about ½ way. The people waved & cheered as if soldiers were something fresh & a Draft goes along this road every week & has done so for years. But it is allways the same anywhere I have marched evidently there is something about soldiers to interest people\n\nThe organization of entraining was good we left about 11 – 8 in each compartment comfortable 2nd class ones Arrived Shorncliff at 5 a m & marched to Folkestone about 1 mile Were alloted to Residential Flats & given a drink of tea right away Breckfast at 7 Bacon Potatoes Bread Jam & Tea sounds allright but it was a poor feed. Fell in soon afterwards were given 24 hours rations & marched straight on to the Boat under a mile left at 10 & in a couple of hours were in Boulongue. The deck was to crowded to get a sleep & although the sea did not look rough the Boat – not a very large one - made sundry irregular movements & there was much sickness. Felt more like being sick myself than at any other time at sea but fortunately reached the harbour before any thing serious happened. Folkeston \nS\n seems a good town what we saw of it. The houses are newer & more uniform than most of the English towns I have seen. About 2 miles from the Quay (Boulonge) \nbr\n mostely\n\nthrough dirty back lanes brought us to the rest camp. It is on top of a hill which carrying a pack seemed to be 10,ooo ft high \n\nThe Dr looked us over & we were alloted to tents – 11 in each – issued with 1 blanket – but we have 2 each Pioneers are good at that sort of thing & seldom go short. It is years since I have seen so much dust, have sandy ground all in & around the camp & being right on top of the hill is quite exposed to strong wind that is blowing Reminds me of the Darling River country in a dry time A few showers crossing the Channel otherwise good weather for moveing. This is up to Wed night","383":"\n","384":"\n\nWas sleeping like a Soldier last night when an Air Raid warning sounded & we had to turn out & take shelter in Trenches. This was at 12.50 a m were kept out for an hour & could still hear the anties firing when we turned in at 2.30 had to turn out again. Clouds were fairly thick \n\nJuly\n\nby this time & the Searchlights playing on & through them were beautifull only out for a few minutes & peace for remainder of night \n\nHad a good breckfast & Marched back to Boulonge leaving there at 2.30 PM by train About 30 of us in each Horse Truck. Went through Estaples – only a few miles from Boulonge & saw where the Hun dropped some of his eggs last night. One had hit the railway line & tipped an engine over another had killed a horse & there were several holes near the line. There is a big camp there & we hear they had a lot of casulties. Had about 2 ft 6 in by 6 in of floor space to sleep on for a start last night & it gradually grew smaller as the others sleeping around stretched out all the same slept some of the time & as a lot of Tommies got out at Rouen at 5 a m some of us moved into an empty & had plenty of room. Reached Harflluer at 10 30 a m (Friday morning) & marched about 1 mile to Camp Have been issued with rifle cover &\n\nWaterproof & well fed. This is our main camp for Reinforcements coming to France about 5 miles from Le Harve\n\nSaturday 27th\n\nRevalie at 5 30 & had to turn out for a Roll Call Spent a streneous morning going through Gass Must have walked between 6 & 7 miles as the Officer in charge got lost for a time. Went through a Gass chamber Lectures Gass Drill etc & walked about ½ a mile with Masks on. When every thing seemed to be finished as we were lined up ready to move off & as it was quite dinner time were getting very impatient when a gass alarm was given several Smoke Bombs were let of to windward & before we could adjust our Masks the dense smellie smoke was all over us – It was harmless of course but is showed clearly how necessary it was to allways have your Mask ready when near the line \n\nReached camp at 11 PM & were warned to be ready at 6 to move to the line. Marched\n\nto Le Harve by a short cut about 4 miles entrained righ away but did not leave untill late don't know just when as I was asleep In the same old horse trucks but they have been improved by putting seats along each side & a double row in the centre also a stove. Only a few in our truck 2 on a seat so had a good sleep. Reached Rouen at 7 AM (Sunday) & went to a rest camp close by the Station. Got leave from 10 till 1 & had a look at the main part of the town Some fine buildings & Churches. A large & very ugly group of Statuery at the end of the Main street does not seem to represent any thing in particular Nearly all the Shops were open allthough it was Sunday A lot of Americans in this rest camp in fact there are all sorts & conditions of troops in it – One young Yank asked me if all our chaps could speak their language as well as I could. He was only a lad & had come from a country district. He sayed it was only 8 weeks since he had first joined up\n\n& I don't think he believed me when I told him I had been 10 weeks on the boat coming over. Entrained again in 3rd class carriages this time plain wood seats 6 to the compartment so 2 stretched out on each seat & 2 on the floor I was one of the latter & once through the night an extra hard bump shot the chap off the seat on top of me equipment & all but had a very good night. Got tea at Etaples & had Breck Passed through Boulonge where we left last Thursday It is a long trip for practically nothing But it is evidently necessary to go through our main camp a Harve & 1st Div men have to come back this way as the","385":" is still in the North. The other Divies go straight to the Somme. Traveled slowly untill 4 PM & left the train near St Omer about ½ a mile brought us to the Reinforcement camp A very pretty place at the back of a big Cheateau 3 or 4 Ac with a hedge & row of fine trees around it & a water hole in the middle & thick green grass everywhere. The tents\n","386":"\n pitched between the trees & Lane sand bags about 2 ft high around them as a protection from Bombs. Have passed through a lot of cultiverted land today the crops look very well. Can hear the Guns in the line \nagain\n onc more & a great number of our Planes keep passing up & down as it is very clear. Issued with a blanket\n","387":"\n\nStarted off for Barrn H.Q. Packs were sent by waggon. There were only 8 of us & we managed to get \na\n two lifts on different lorries which saved us about ½ the walk – 12 to 14 killos – A Co was camped right at HQ so was right at home straight away. My Platoon is right in the line but am not being sent up as they are to come out in a day or 2 Quite a hot day. This seems to be a good camp well back & all the Dug outs are at least ½ under ground. Started to make one for my self this afternoon but did very little as I have been yarning to old mates most of the time. Plenty of big\n","388":" August\n\nguns about but none very close. The French are looking after there crops all around here. They are very good & nearly ripe. But a lot of Trenches have been dug through them in case the Hun gets through\n","389":"\n\nWent to Divisional Baths this morning the clean flannel I got was much dirtier than the dirty one I gave in. Issued with cotton Shorts instead of Underpants. They are good for marching & much cooler A Co played Head 2 Cricket & were beaten We hear that we are to move somewhere in a few days\n","390":"\n\nLoafed about the camp all day. Packed & sent our Packs & Blankets away this evening as we are to move tomorrow. Played cards untill 1 a m & then stretched out \nfor\n on the ground but got no sleep\n","391":"\n\nHad Bre\n Turned out at 4 a m & had Breck right away Then the usual bustle to fall in\n\nAugust\n\nOnce you have fallen in it is the dead end Apparently there is nothing more to be done that day as you allways stand about for ½ or perhaps an hour before anything happens Moved off at 5.45 & marched about 16 Killos through Longue Croix, Gliblingham, Renescuoi, & other small places to Champagn a wee place about 6 Ks from St Amour arrived 11 a m Light rain started about 10 oclock & laid the dust nicely a pleasant morning for marching if marching can ever be called pleasant. Owing to our excelent orginazitaion we had to wait nearly 2 hours for dinner which consisted of tea only. Certainly lit was raining but as the fires can be kept alight in the cookers when traveling it should not have made much difference. Passed millions of rounds of artiliary amunition stacked along side the road – about a mile of it. We are 12 in a tent\n","392":"\n\nFell in twice for inspection this morning Went for a walk around some of the villages in afternoon\n","393":"\n\nChurch Parade had to march about 1 Killo along a very muddie lane A very good address. The Hun came over last night & we had quite a good search light display as there were low clouds Saw no Planes & heard no eggs burst.\n","394":"\n\nA lot of messing about this morning as we were inspected by Maj Gen Glascow he is in charge of the Division. It was had enough but nothing to the afternoon. My Platoon or rather part of it is on Picquet duty & had just drawn our tea when we were ordered to fall Of course we did not fall in imediately but growled & argued & bolted as much tucker as possible Then as usual stood about were inspected 4 times Now have 1½ hours to wait before going out. The Picquet amounted to going about I mile & sitting down until 4 PM then back. Forgot to mention had 2 parcels a few days ago One from Ann One \n\nAugust\n\n nurishment in each also a Newspaper from Mother\n","395":"\n\nOrder to fall \nin at\n move of at 8 PM so have fallen in twice this morning fully loaded. Left camp at 4 PM & marched about 4 Killos to Arcquers where we entrained It was a dark night & no plaines about Comfort Fund supplies cocoa & our cooks Tea so we did well. Started about 11 PM my truck was full but in spite of that I was fairly comfortable in a corner but got no sleep. Traveled more or less all night passing through Abbie Ville Fontain Longpray Etc. More Comfort fund Coca at 6 AM. Detrained at Hangest on the Somme at 11.30 AM Wed & marched about 2 Kilos to a rest camp at Bourdon Left there at 6 PM & footed it for 8 or 10 Kilos when we were overtaken by the Motor Busses that had been waiting for us about the camp Most of our Officers were drunk which probably accounted for the mismanagement\n\n& our \"buckshee\" march. Passed through Felixcourt & Doublins quite big places. The O.C was very full He managed to balance himself in front of our Co & finding it was A & the B was in front & C co behind could not quite make out which way we were going. Had a rough cramped ride on the Busses untill about 2 AM then marched & waited about eventually climbing 3 flights of stars to the garret of a very large building. Got a drink of tea & turned in\n","396":"\n\nFound this morning we were in what has been a large Hospital on the outskirts of Amiens. Did not have to turn out untill 10 AM so had a much needed sleep. Washed shaved & had a good meal. There is a clock tower just above our sleeping appartment where one can get an excelent view of Amiens & surroundings. Does not seem a very larg place or to be much \n","397":"\n\ndammaged by shell fire. The only signs of War are plenty of Plains passing up & down & some of the walls have been roughly loopholed. Went into the Town as far as we are allowed a larger place than it looks from the Tower. A lot of prisoners have passed through this morning & if half the yarns we have heard are half true we are having a good win Had a good hot bath & change of underclothes\n","398":"\n\nHad a good nights sleep in our garatt Have fallen in twice this morning but only had our rifles inspected Orders to be ready to move at any time which we did at 5.30 PM per book Marched until 8.30 & billeted in a \nn\n very much battered village Blance or some such name as far as I could find out. We are in an old house built as usual around a square about 50 ft across with the manure heap in the center in fact almost filling it. Plenty of very dirty straw to\n\nsleep on had a good night\n","399":"\n\nMoved off at 11 AM & reached Villiers Britineu about 1 PM about 8 Killos. It was hot & most of the time we had to keep to the crowded main road with its constant stream of vehicle traffic so there was some dust. I was very tired at one time but livened up towards the end & finished well.\n\nOur Billet has been a very decent 2 storied terrace Not much of the top one left but we have managed to clean up enough floor space in the bottom rooms to sleep on. It is sad to see this place little better than a heap of ruins & most people must have left in a great hurry as so much of there portable belongings are lying about even to clothing. In ther room are 2 large photos in gilt frames unbroken. In the next room a sewing machine & all sorts of odds & ends broken & unbroken\n\nWhat the fighting does not destroy the men billeted in these places afterwards will as far as I can see. Here for instance there were some plates cups etc in a cubbord. Some of the chaps used them & \ninstead of\n threw them out of the window when finished. There are men camped in or passing through these places every day & as they all do much the same thing it is not long before there is nothing left. There is not a house in the place that has not been hit, of course it has been right in the fighting for months & is not out of it yet. This country more hilly than where we were in the North\n","400":"\n\nSome bombs & shells were dropped about last night none close The vibration from the explosions used to shake the dust & plaster from the celing onto our little beds. Had dinner & moved of at 1.30 PM. It was hot & dusty plenty of traffic to stir it up. Crossed a flat uninteresting plane most of the way. There was some smell from the dead horses lying about\n\nnoticed only one dead man. This is where the advance was 4 days ago. Marched untill 4.30 & were told to dig in in a railway cutting. Just got started when orders came to stop as a better place had been found about ¼ of a mile on. It was evidently where the Infantry had dug in on the first night of the advance. Short bits of trench & holes big enough for 1 or 2 men Morrison & I got a piece of trench made it a bit larger & covered it with iron. Came through 2 little villages today all battered up also passed a railway dump where the Huns have left a lot of stuff also a big railway gun that had been captured. It had been used for shelling Amiens. Saw 3 of our Planes that had been brought down & a damaged tank. Did not fell the march so much tonight as I had left a flannel shirt & pr of sox behind to lighten the load. We all camped near Arbiners & Aosiers\n","401":"\n\nWere told to make our dugouts splinter\n\nproof & be ready to move off on 10 minutes notice Morrie & I were not sorry to alter our abode as we had found it too narrow & short for comfort & got very little sleep as bits of dirt kept falling of the & top on us & the place seemed full of insects & crawling things. Our guns did a lot of work & Jerry kept his shells & bombs going all night. None very close as we are in a safe place well out in the open & we must be a fair distance from the line as it is only big stuff that comes about. Moved off at 8 PM in Battle Order & picks & shovels. Marched fully 5 miles waited in a trench for a long time & walked back Did nothing. When we reached what turned out to be the end of our trip last night a Trench Morter opened up just behind us Jerry replied getting closer to us than the Morter. Fortunately we were beside an old trench & all hands dived for it at least I did not as I \nnot\n as I thought a shell to myself would be better than \n\ngetting all mixed up with the mob in the trench. Anyhow none of us got it a small piece hit my shovel handle just beside me – We were lucky as 15 or 20 shells burst very close. When the little straff\" was over got in the trench & slept untill the next one started \n\nGot back to camp at 4 a m hungry & weary. Got some tea & slept. Some planes had a go at us on the way home do not think they could see us but got close with there machine guns The night plains are one of the worst features here now. Dark nights are ones only hope for a little peace. They don't seem to do much damage compared to what might happen if the bombs fell just where they wanted them to. But they get on ones nerves a bit & you cannot hit back\n\nTuesday 13th\n\nOrders to pack & be ready to move at noon. Believe we were supposed to be a supporting party last night so perhaps were \n","402":"\n\nof more use than appeared. Some of the other Cos had a few casualities. Did not start untill 4 PM as the day was hot it was well. Got the same Billet in Villers Brettineau but came on a much shorter road & less dust. A few men got rides on empty Lorries upseting some of the Heads muchly much questioning was done but of course no one had seen anything. Much interest was also taken in our feet & \"Condies\" issued to bath them in. The usual nightly bombs were dropped mostly at a distance \n\nShould have mentioned that marching up on Sunday saw a Hun plane bring down one of our Observation Ballons The Observers hopped out & looked very quaint coming down slowly with there white parachoots. The burning baloon seemed almost to tutch them as it fell leaveing a great coloum of smoke straight behind it as there was no wind\n","403":"\n\nMarched of at 9.30 a m & have camped \n\non an open hill side near a village which is or rather was Hammell there is not much of it left. There is a fine water hole here sort of swamp beside the Somme canall. Have had a fine swim this afternoon. Some were trying to get fish with bombs but did not seem to have any luck. Have been able to post letters first time since we left the North. We are about 3 miles from Corliu.\n","404":"\n\nSquared a shell hole out about 6 inches deep last evening got some dry straw & had a good bed for the night. Bombs as usual & bullets fell in the camp no harm done Am Observation Baloon went past this morning fastened to its truck about 100 ft up There were 5 motors of different kinds & 60 to 80 men in the turn our – quite a circus. It was a hot day & haveing nothing to do slept most of the time\n","405":"\n\nAs there were clouds had a quiet night\n\nSaw a horse being taken back in a horse ambulance a good idea. Several tanks went up this morning the first I have been close to while they were on the move. Have seen there tracks in all sorts of odd places (railway cuttings or banks seem nothing to them) they have been used largely in the advance 4 Aussie letters today 2 from home\n","406":"\n\nA very quiet night quite cold. Have given our packs in to be stored. It does not lighten my load much as I find I need my bed shet Greatcoat & waterproof to keep any way warm most nights. Was put on makeing a bank around our horse lines to save them from bomb splinters. Every thing must live below ground level or have a bank around it here. Salvaged some iron & made our humpie much warmer & more rain proof\n","407":"\n\nA very quiet night a little rain this\n\nmorning The humpie is very comfortable & warm. Some indian troops passed they look well on horseback. A chap put a Stokes bomb beside his fire to rest his dixie on of course there was a fine explosion no one hurt. Dixie is missing\n","408":"\n\nA little; very little drill this morning Swimming carnival in afternoon too cold for me.\n","409":"\n\nDrill this morning at least \nit w\n we are supposed to drill. We do a few moments untill the Officers get away & then sit down. If an Officer comes along when we are doing nothing the Sargent says he is giveing us a lecture & the Officer smiles & passes on. Went to see a Company of Infantry practicing an attack covered by Tanks The tanks can go practically anywhere & it is wonderful how they stand the bump when they go head first into a trench\n\n& then there nose pokes straight up in the air untill they balance back to there right level again. They turn easily in there own length & get up a fair pace. And flatening barb wire is right in there hand. One of my chaps got a bullet through the foot while batheing yesterday supposed to be done by some one shooting fish. There are very few accidents considering the opportunities & the way men mess about with bombs & old sheets. The line seems to have moved up a lot since we camped here as the Observation Balloons are allmost out of sight\n\n"}}
