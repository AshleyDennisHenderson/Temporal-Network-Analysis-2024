Rec’d our issue of sheepskin \n","3":" \n\nObtained leave Camp as from now and proceeded to London in a bitterly cold Having to wait at Salisbury for train connection. Ronnie Hill and I strolled round town and had afternoon tea. Did not arrive in London until and later in the night I had supper at Corner House to the \n\nAldwych but unfortunately no beds were available. Ronnie Hill had however left a note for me to follow him to Shakespeare Hut and after running about in the YMCA motor I eventually arrived there and had some refreshment & bed.\n","4":" \n\nAfter breakfast to Strand – made a few purchases returned to Camp by 11 train from Waterloo. The train was a beauty and did not stop once. On arrival at Camp it was bitterly cold and at night we had a few flakes of snow.\n","5":"\n\nStill very cold. Dentists at 9 to have tooth completed. At night the snow came down in earnest and after tea snowball fights were the fashion.\n","6":" \n\nWhen we awoke it was to see a beautiful white mantle over everything and it was a sight I shall always remember. We made snow men and had snow fights until our hands & feet were numb and wet thro. During afternoon the snow eased off and Sam and I went for a walk to Durrington.\n","7":" \n\nRaining. Snow almost thawed by now.. Orderly Room.\n","8":" \n\nRoute march in morning. Telegram from Ernie. To Amesbury at night & posted letters (7). Received gas & trench helmets and goggles\n","9":" \n\n \n\nLEAVING FOR FRANCE\n\nWed (contd)\n","10":"\n \n\nFinal preparations for hurrying off tomorrow. On making enquiries for my cable money £4-7-10 I found it had been forwarded to France.\n\nThursday \n24\n 23rd \n\nDid not sleep too as floor was hard without palaisse & only 2 blankets. So at the appointed hour of rising 3.45 am nearly everyone was awake. \n\nThen followed cup of tea & light refreshment and after cleaning up we were on parade at 5.30 in total darkness. Moved off at 5.45 and soon got quite warm. In addition to our valise well packed we carried 2 blankets one waterproof sheet one service cap 1 haversack packed 1 water bottle filled 2 gas masks & 1\n\nPair tear shell goggles 1 steel helmet 1 mess tin filled 1 tucker bag, filled 1 pouch filled as well as sheepskin vest & greatcoat. Entrained at Amesbury and was lucky enough to be with John Driver Ron Hill Jack Perry the four of us being only ones in our compartment – the majority carrying eight. Without much delay in 1½ hours we arrived at Southampton at about 9 and heaving our packs on wharf we were allowed to walk the wharf. We were there until 7 pm. Then we fell in & marched on board our ferry transport boat the Queen a paddle steamer. We pushed off at about 8.\n\nThings went well for about an hour or so – although it was raining upstairs & crowded downstairs. \n\nAt sea we struck bad weather and then the fun commenced. Soon ninety percent of those on board were sea sick. I must confess that altho’ we were 10 weeks on our trip from Aust – yet I never felt it as I did this trip. I went upstairs for air on one occasion and the confusion was indescribable. There were men everywhere throwing up also downstairs – none were particular.\n\n(We had on board the whole of our Ambulance (less transport) the Light Blues, Purple & Red (A) and English Drafts)\n\nOwing to the rough seas we did not arrive in France until 6 am next morning. One of the first things that met our was a British Red Cross Hosp\n\na beautiful glass looking building. \n","11":" \n\nAt daylight we were put shore at Havre and a cup of tea was made for us. At 10 we moved off again and arrived at a Rest Camp about 2 miles away in due course. Saw plenty of German prisoners huge broken guns and war necessities en route. At the Rest Camp we met some Australians back from the “Somme\" and other “Tommies\". Put into bell tents (10 in a tent) and somewhat crowded. At night we visited the YMCA in the Camp and chatted to a Scotch lady who was working here for a few months. Also chatted to a Belgian soldier. He was wounded at & was at & Antwerp and after making munitions in England was now employed at same work here. Into bed as best we could and rain in night made things very uncomfortable.\n","12":" \n\nReveille at 6.30 am. Still raining heavy. Pack up kit & cup of tea etc and at 8.30 we were ready to move off again. March to station and packed into cattle trucks – 35 in each – still wet through. Then followed a dreary time prolonged by delays en route. We passed Rouen at midnight. Tea at but could not sleep as we were too cramped. I sat up all night and generally spent an uncomfortable time.\n","13":"\n\nOur train pushed on rather slowly and only covered 75 miles during 15 hours. However at about midnight we arrived\n","14":" \n\nat Abbeville and procured a cup of tea. During the day the sun shone and the scenery en route was rather good but the low lying parts were flooded. There were several troop trains in front & several behind us which accounted for our slow progress. Could not sleep again but noticed that we passed thro’ Ettapes, Boulogne & Calais. Then on \npassed\n past Hazesbruck on to Ballieul where we were pleased to disentrain. After cleaning up our train we were put on to “London buses\" commandeered for purpose & \ndrove\n carried to our billets at Steinwurk (Steenwerck) a village midway between Ballieul & Armentieres.\n\nOUR FIRST GLIMPSE OF WAR\n\nWe had not been there long before we witnessed a go between German anti aircraft guns & one of our machines. The aeroplane got away safely. The peculiar black smoke of bursting shells was easily distinguished as German explosive. The guns could be distinctly heard. We obtained billets in a hospital (empty) and given leave for a few hours. We took advantage of this \n\nto look round Steenwerck.\n\n \nMonday 27th\n ","15":" \n\nGas mask drill in morning. In afternoon was placed to guard Red Cross Stores and acting as Storeman. It was just here that I noticed the network of underground passages in our\n\nbillets.\n\nSaw by an English paper that a raid was made on the Channel by German destroyers on night of 23rd inst. – the night we were transported across to France. After tea I went for a walk around village and succeeded in falling into a dirty trench used as a gutter. To make things more uncomfortable water was hard to obtain.\n","16":"\n\nWhen I awoke it was to learn that I was – with 19 others to go up to the lines and run a Divisional Baths at Nieppe – quite close at Armentieres. After breakfast we set out along the muddy road and after a couple of hours arrived at Nieppe and it was interesting to see the damage done by German guns. The Town Hall & Church were especially suffering. A tram line was partially closed & had not been used recently & along the road the place teemed with old trenches & barbed wire entanglements all relicts of German invasion. quite close to us is Estaires another town which suffered. In due course we arrived at our destination and “A\" section who accompanied us continued on to the trenches at Chappel D’Armentieres. \n\nThe Baths were an enormous undertaking and a detailed\n\naccount of its working will follow later.\n\nWe were quartered in a concrete floored building at rear & during the afternoon we put thro’ 500 men, which was entirely satisfactory.\n","17":" \n\nPay to day. For the first time our Pay books were marked “Paid in the Field\" £1-8-8 (we were paid 40 francs)\n\nMet Norman Siddens of Lhardt He is in 4th Div and had just returned from the Somme this morning.\n\nThe Divisional baths were closed all day to square up and prepare for working them in earnest. Reinforcements arrived for us this morning as it was found impossible to run the show properly under 60 men.\n\nJust here it is interesting to note how the civilian population still carry on with their work notwithstanding guns machine guns shells \nstar shells can\n make a noise as if only a few hundred yds away. They are only about 3 miles off and there is a battery of artillery in an adjacent field that rattles all our windows frequently.\n\nCannot emphasise the shocking need for fresh water in these parts. It is almost impossible to obtain and the tea we drink is always flavoured with alum (used for clarifying)\n","18":" \n\nBaths still closed. Was on sanitary work of Baths yesterday & today. Received a bumper mail today (I received no less than 18) In our billet there are 3 pairs of German top boots probably Ulans left when they evacuated this town. At 6 pm Major Honman lectured us on our several duties for tomorrow and I was a Lance Corp. in charge of sanitation. Some job. \n\nIt might be stated that Armentieres is practically surrounded by Germans and a sudden advance by them would cut us off.\n\nPicking up the French lingo by degrees\n\nARMENTIERES\n","19":"\n\nBaths going again. Put thro’ about 600 today.\n","20":" \n\nReceived about 17 letters Australian mail, Also the proceeds of my cable, £4-7-10\n\nThis afternoon with Jack Driver to Armentieres and saw our Dressing Station & Hospital. Beautiful & up to date town was my impression of Armentieres. the red brick with white facings being particularly pretty. A large Cathedral had been badly damaged. Received parcel from Harold Baldock. Got used to seeing the word Estaminet (tavern)\n\nDIVISIONAL BATHS\n","21":" \n\nReceived tin cigarettes from Miss Sinclair and parcel from McIlraths bearing no name of sender. Also rec’d 4 letters from Australia. Clear night severe bombardment from heavy guns. Some seemed to burst quite near.\n\nGas attack signalled but only confined to a local area on left flank. \n","22":" \n\nOutline of the routine for men passing thro’ the Divisional Baths.\n\nThe O.C. of the party obtains a chit from the office shewing number of men to be bathed. The men are then lectured as to instructions and they pass in by front entrance. On right they leave their valuables and then on to undressing room. Leaving their under clothes on they pass into the Bath Room. Whilst they are bathing a man takes their clothes into the ironing room where they are brushed, the seams ironed & painted with insect grease\n\nWhen the men arrive in Bath Room they take off their dirty clothes, hand them in, get a check for them & obtain clean clothes. They then have their bath in the vats provide for purpose. About 1500 are put through each day.\n\nWhilst the above is proceeding another department is boiling clothes – handing them on to 120 women who wash them. They then go thro’ the hydraulic press thence up the shoot to the drying room upstairs.\n\nIt takes clothes approx 5 hours to become thoroughly dry. The Sanitary system of France or of these parts at any rate, is absolutely bad. Urine & foecies are thrown haphazardly about and the soil thereby is all foul.\n","23":"","24":" \n\nInspected the upstairs drying room with Sam and from the outside platform caught a glimpse of the River Lys and the Bridge (Pont de Nieppe). It was a beautiful scene added to by the beauty of the moon which to night was shining. Have not commented on the scenery of France as it is now winter and everything has the dull appearance. At night we met a New Zealander in a coffee house who was to marry a French girl next Saturday. He had purchased a house in anticipation.\n","25":"\n\nRaining. Received socks & mittens from Miss Waterhouse. Very bad war news coming thro’ just now. The enemy is overrunning Roumania.\n","26":" \n\nRaining again. \n","27":"\n\nSent a registered letter to W Hough Amesbury re watch. Also enclosed 6 francs. Exchanged a P\/N (British) at Field Post Office. Had tea in Nieppe. During afternoon a big gun gave us a shock occasionally. It was just behind our billet. But the capper of the day came\n\nwhen we visited Nieppe and saw on return journey a battle that was progressing south of us, probably Estaires. To hear the roar of numerous heavy guns to see the star shells and other shells bursting was a sight that hypnotised us for a while. It was grand.\n","28":" \n\nSergt Williams & Geo Pickering have not been too well for some days and today they were both sent to Hospital. Probably influenza. Consequently I filled the position in Orderly Room and found things rather busy today. Had my head down all day on returns, and wages etc. and bed at 10.15.\n","29":" \n\nStill going hard on C Section Acquittance Roll and returns but outlook better than yesterday. By night things were pretty straight.\n\n Ommission\n Yesterday was one of the clearest we have had for some time consequently air craft were active and a German nearly flew over our Baths. Quite a number of the ‘scraps’ took place during morning plainly visible to us and a German machine was brought down near Armentieres. The white of ours and black powder of enemy’s was clearly marked.\n\nTuesday (contd) Snowing rather heavily in morning but not cold.\n","30":" \n\nThings pretty straight.\n\nHeard that a message had come thro’ in night to say that a strafing was expected.

Received about 6 letters.\n\nSergt Williams has recovered and came back today but has a couple of days on light duty. Feet not too good. First sign of chill blains. Put it down to not \nbeing\n having so much exercise of late.\n","33":"\n\nAt tea time had some fun with bon bons etc. Hogged the contents of a parcel the major gave us. Later 3 parcels for Harold Williams – more hogging.\n\nClear day again and more aeroplane activity & anti air craft guns.\n\nLaundry Hands. Pay Day\n","34":" \n\nHad rest.

Some good stunts.\n","38":" \n\nLetters to H J Baldock\n\n& bro Ernie. Raining all day.\n","39":"","40":"\n\nSome peculiar sayings drop out sometimes and one today was typical. Word had come through that the Commander in Chief of 2nd Army Corps would be in District today & the men were told to keep an eye & be careful to salute. Consequently one of the boys came into the billet at a great pace & announced that the Commander in Chief would be ‘prowling’ around today. Prowling has it.\n\nVery clear day & great aerial activity. Saw some rare fighting in the air.\n","41":"\n\nWent into Armentieres in the afternoon with Corps Chas Hamblin & Joe Nankevil & had a good look around notwithstanding that aircraft guns were crackling all around us. After tea we adjourned to YMCA & spent the evening singing Christmas Carols & Hymns & subsequently listened to a natty little sermon by a South Australian.\n\nOn return we were surprised to see Col Maguire waiting with a load of ‘Comforts’ & each of us received a pudding & packet of things from the Comforts Fund (Each packet contained packet cigarettes (Peter Pan) small tin tobacco, Tin boiled lollies, writing pad, playing cards & some nuts). I also recd letter from bro & parcel from Mrs Hodge of Crookwell. The Colonel shook our hands all round & wished us merry Xmas.\n","42":" 1916\n\nMonday 25th Christmas Day\n\nIt rained like billeo all night and accompanied with the rain was a particularly severe bombardment by our boys. In fact it was just one continual roar for some time. I was on duty all day but the dinner we had was truly worth remembering.\n\nSome day previous the boys had got a turkey from the village & potatoes & a host of other things which only cost us about 5 Francs each. The menu was excellent and we were lucky enough to get a holly branch making it appear O.K. Turkey, baked spuds, pickles cabbage, bread, Coffee & milk (tinned stuff but good) then to follow Tinned pudding from the Comforts & tinned fruit nuts boiled lollies ginger & dates in galore. How’s That. We have enough over to last tea time.\n\nBurkitt & Egan & I have just completed the erection of new latrines & they are some. Souvenired all the material. Today the river has flooded & is only about 2 ft from flooding us out of our billets. All the surrounding country is one sheet of water and it was no wonder that no progress could be made in this region in previous winters. (River Lys) Very strong wind today & rather cutting too.\n\nThis afternoon am doing\n\nOrderly Room work as all the staff have gone to Armentieres to dinner. \n\nApres the dinner\n several toasts were drunk in coffee including the King, Our Absent Friends & Loved Ones with which was coupled Our mothers wives & sweethearts & sisters and relations & friends. Also ‘The ladies’ who donated our Comforts. At night terrific bombardment.\n\nTuesday 26th \n","43":" Working hard again. Saw ‘Battle of the Somme’. Pond in next paddock caused by overflow from River frozen again. Beautiful grey blue mist.\n","44":" \n\nA beautiful white covering on ground looked exactly like snow but turned out to be hoar frost. It was very nippy and the ice on pools was ¼ to ½ thick. Watercart contents were frozen. Aeroplane activity. Ten of our boys transferred to A.D.S. and last night 10 came to relieve them. Received watch from W. Hough Amesbury repaired.\n","45":"","46":"\n\nScotch parson to tea\n\nSaturday 30th\n\nPictures at night Saw ‘Gentlemen of Nerve’ River rising again after heavy rain. Whilst doing the rounds encountered a Belgian who had tied his barge up to our wharf. It appears he was to unload coal.\n\nSunday 31st New Years Eve\n\nRiver still rising and is over the wall of our wharf. I spent the night making \n\na path to the cookhouse as we expected all our ground to be flooded tomorrow. Had on gum boots & saved some salvage. This afternoon had afternoon tea with Madame in tuck shop in Pont de Nieppe with Sam & the boys. Walk to Nieppe.\n\nA terrific bombardment is just commencing probably to usher in the New Year (11 pm) Forgot to mention that 5 of boys were transferred to A.D.S. today\n\n1917\n","47":" \n\nNew Years Day\n\nMore bombardment – and at 2 am this morning a daddy one which lasted some time. Water still rising though not so quickly.\n","48":" \n\nRiver has gone down a little so danger at present is averted.\n","49":"\n\nVery cool & strong wind today. To Pictures at night Saw Chaplin in “Pangs of Love\" & “Mary Queen of Scots\" awful Then had fish & eggs at tuck shop. Very tricky the bowls without handles to drink out of. Was up in night – not too well\n","50":"\n\nSpent morning in bed Did not eat anything\n\nexcept Army biscuit & cup of coffee which Sam brought. Eating the biscuit I snapped off one of front teeth. Consequently as I got well again about 12 I spent afternoon in Armentieres having the tooth repaired. At night I saw the 3rd Div Follies or Pierrots in the Ecole Theatre Armentieres & a very good show it was. Back with Sergt Williams to Baths.\n","51":"","52":" \n\nLetters from Sth Africa & Bro Ern.\n","53":"\n\nMoved our billet to front of baths as the old one was needed for other work. Spent all morning transferring our goods & chattels.\n\nFIRST VISIT TO FRONT LINE\n\nAt 1.45 pm Joe Nankevil & I obtained ‘duty pass’ to A.D.S. & proceeded on our way thereto. Passed Armentieres Railway Stn. where the sentry was very particular. Then down roadway & as we progressed we nearly walked on top of some of our batteries pounding away at Fritz. On one occasion I was passing an opening in a wall when I saw a flight & was nearly swept off my feet with the concussion of one of our big guns. Couldn’t hear for some seconds after. From here onwards we had to be careful & keep close in to the house to prevent aeroplane detection. At last we came to Chapelle Armentieres & one of the boys showed us where shells had\n\nfallen only yesterday. Our A.D.S. was in an old Brick Kiln and very comfortable except for the rats which are more like cats. The Purity League was working here and business was slow. After getting this far we decided to visit R.A.P. and receive instructions as to route. Entering trench behind the A.D.S. we wound round & round it seemed until at last we reached the R.A.P. which was in an old shelled dwelling most of the dugouts were sandbagged but ours was not. It was good to see how nicely the trenches were drained & floored. The boys at R.A.P. were Roy Egan, Chas Hamblin, Mealey & Macey and they soon made us at home. Tea was on and consisted of porridge dry rations tea bread & jam. was cook & the whole feed was grand & enjoyable.\n\nThen Charlie shewed us upstairs from where we could see “No mans land\" & surroundings & on a clear day Lille. Soon after dark transports brought ammunition & food up & kicked up a deuce of a noise. Yesterday afternoon some shells fell in the back garden of the R.A.P. but did no damage. On way back (at about 7) we stopped with Sam in his dug out for a while & pushed on & arrived back in\n\ngood time. With the exception of a continual bombardment by our boys there was nothing doing.\n","54":" \n\n came up for a bath today & he told us that Fritz dropped about 70 near R.A.P. this morn. No casualties reported to date. Very cold wind this afternoon. Reced numerous papers tonight.\n","55":"\n\nVery cold today. Extra special bombardment tonight.\n","56":"\n\nSaw a very usual sight this afternoon. Two of our observation balloons were up from midday (sausage type) At about 4 pm I was working in the back of Baths near our Incinerator when a bright flare lit up the sky and looking in the direction was astounded to see the object diving to the earth from a good height leaving behind a wide trail of bluish black smoke. At same time aircraft guns from all directions opened fire and it was then that I realized a German had settled one of our balloons. Our guns gave him a hot time but he evaded them & when over his own lines the enemy aircraft guns also opened fire giving the impression that he was disguised as one of ours. It was a grand sight.\n\nIt may be interesting to describe an Estaminet scene (I have often been delighted to visit to see the fun) They are not like our Hotels and the villages simply abound with them. There is a counter in some case where the beer etc is handed over. You walk in get your drink & sit down at a table of which there are usual a dozen in each outfit. Then the piano starts & fun commences & more you drink the better you sing. Style Compre. At 8 o’clock (weet heure) kick out time comes.\n","57":" \n\nBox bombardment\n","58":"\n\nDid not get to sleep until midnight as Phelan & Wilson created a disturbance – after being paid - by coming home shiggered & ended up by tossing things about a little.\n","59":"\n\nMrs Bs birthday. Sent a F.S.C. tonight Also recd a letter from Ernie & answered it. Today has been coldest for some time & I spent all the afternoon working in snow fall accompanied by little rain. Glad of a bath & change. Sam at a Gas School at Casserou (?)\n","60":"\n\nRiver again in flood and came up very fast during the night – so fast that I spent the afternoon building a path to the cookhouse.\n\nAt night I went to Armentieres with Ron Ponton – staying at Marie Choselet’s near Pont de Nieppe (Bridge) for cup of coffee. The method of partaking of . coffee is worth noting. The beans are put thro’ the machine in ordinary way and after making is poured into the peculiar no handled bowls and a dash of rum added. Instead of sugar you are given a small lolly to hold in your mouth whilst drinking and the coffee goes down well. On arrival at Armentieres we went to M.D.S. thence to tea & Church in YMCA. The Rev Capt Mills preaching.\n","61":" \n\nLarge Australian mail I received about 14 letters. The snow & heavy frost of early morn made it exceptionally cold.\n","62":"\n\nAnother frost & cold\n","63":"\n\nnil\n","64":"\n\nThis snowing & frosty and very cold At night the Malgars (Ernie Lawless, Bill Howard, Wagstaffe, J. Gocabi ) & mac Wilson & I went to an Estaminet and had a social evening there. Singing etc. Champagne etc. Met Wood having a bath today. He is looking well. Is now a Lieut (Second) and still attached to the M G Coy. Had a good old chat over\n\nSTRETCHER BEARING IN TRENCHES\n\nBoard matters mentioning that Miss Lang & Mrs Mallard had written him. Also Ces Thompson Bert Fitz & Bert Mulls deaths. He was going in tomorrow at Houplines \nGillespie broke his arm Friday\n \n","65":"\n\nPreparing to go to A.D.S. tonight. Sam returned from Gas School today (Casson). At night 7 of us including Ernie Lawless, Wag Howard Wilf Boyles, Rosenthal left the Baths by Ambulance Car and arrived at ADS about ½ hour later. Slept on stretcher. Rats galore.\n","66":"\n\nWhen I awoke it was icy cold and the snow which has been on ground for days is still frozen over. After breakfast I was appointed water picket and which on that job our artillery opened fire just nearby kicking up a deuce of noise. Shells commenced to fly about & Fritz replied later. It was hard to distinguish Fritzs from ours. One chap brought up by our R.A.P. bearers with one leg off.\n\nThe Tommies coming out are comical and cut some funny figures. Such remarks as, Have a monkey . Have some butterscotch etc when they havnt a cent is typical. This picket game is no bon as plaster falls off the wall all over you\n\nI made a bit of a fire with furniture & making some water hot fixed up the pump which had frozen.\n","67":"\n\nWater carrying & some heavy work. At 5 pm I went on Gas picket (watching for gas attacks) but my shift did not start until 3 next a m so had some sleep in the meantime. On sentry from 3 to 7 am & very cold. A “stiff un\" was brought up for Harry the grave digger just before my shift commenced.\n","68":"\n\nAfter breakfast slept until midday Then pack up blanket etc and off up trenches to Reg Aid Post. No sooner had we arrived there than two cases came along & later two more. The trench duckboards are terribly hard to walk on as they have a thick coating of ice of a weeks duration. Therefore we preferred the roadway for taking our patients notwithstanding orders to the contrary.\n\nThings went well until night time. Jack Arkins & I were resting on the roadway near Suicide Corner when up went a \nsearchlight\n star shell & after a few seconds bang bang bang & then a whizz ------ We didnt wait for more but Jack was down on his face & I made headlong for the gutter\n\nwhich happened to be a trench & I went into it. They burst on roadway uncomfortably near & when I arose to push on without delay you could have heard my knees shaking although outwardly we were jolly & laughing over our narrow escape. Fritz shelled that road several times during that night & next day but we werent that close. I have had stomach complaint for a couple of days (probably the chlorinated water) and felt very weak. \nAbout midnight\n spent a couple of hrs without sleep that night. It was freezing too.\n","69":" \n\nWhen we took our next patients along we could see several shell holes along the cobbled road & knew that Fritz had had a pleasant night. Was relieved at noon & came back to A.D.S.\n\nAll the pools in the neighborhood are frozen the fools amuse themselves by using their horse shoes heels & nails as pr of skates. Good fun. Rested during afternoon & felt much better at night. Slept well.\n","70":"\n\nOn Gas Picket in morning. At noon Fritz got very nasty & sent a heap of shells over near our R.A.P. We could see it all from A.D.S. Some of the boys changing over got some scares. Included in the shells\n\nwere some “tear shells\" and caused some “crying\". Some damage was done however. Today was an excellently clear day and if it were not for snow on the ground the frost & ice etc. & cold we could have enjoyed it. I was unlucky to be selected for R.A.P. again tomorrow so consequently had to be on gas picket tonight. I was again fortunate however as I struck the first shift and so got a decent sleep. Some of the boys of ‘A’ Section were relieved tonight.\n","71":"\n\nSoon after breakfast Fritz got a nasty fit again and sent over 16 H.Es into the paddock adjoin our A.D.S. apparently with the intention of finding some guns there but apart from giving us a fireworks display and earth bath etc nothing happened. At noon thirty we relieved the boys at R.A.P. and had a quiet afternoon. At night the pumps froze & we had to collect snow to boil for tea. Quite successful. Machine gunner playing tattoo. Very fortunate that night, had a good nights rest.\n","72":"\n\nNear midday I took a walking case down to A.D.S. & rested afternoon. \n\nAnswers any day (Australia) At night troops were moved up the lines in anticipation of a stunt tomorrow (the\n\nKaisers birthday)\n\nI was astounded however at about 8.45 when word came for me to report to the Baths tonight. I only had 5 minutes to pack up as motor was waiting but soon collected my goods & was on journey in no time. The roads were simply packed with troops. Only took me as far as M.D.S. so had a very cold time to Baths. It was also against orders to walk about alone. Arrived in due course and found that most of our boys had been transferred elsewhere that 50 P B men (5th Div) were taking over & that Sergt Williams was to report to A.D.S. Hence I was to relieve him. Slept well.\n","73":"\n\nNot\n Kaisers birthday. Not very much doing. Soon got into running at Baths. Quite a rest. At night Sergt Williams pushed off.\n","74":"\n\nRecd letters from Aust. Bath & shave and walk to Nieppe. Still very cold. One day last week it was only 7 degrees (25 below freezing) Everything is frozen that is liquid & roads very slippery.\n","75":"\n\nWrote home.\n","76":" \n\nPhil Kirkham received 3 stripes in place of Harold Williams who is leaving for 1st Anzac Head Q shortly in Concert Party.

Our men to told to be readiness but were not needed except Capt Vickers who left for M.D.S. & worked all night.

It is reckoned that we are to take these Baths over very soon now hence the inspection.\n","87":"","88":"\n\nA very eventful day. Usual work during the day About noon we got word to “stand by\" in anticipation of a big stunt tonight. This of course spoilt all our Sunday afternoon arrangements but took advantage of it by having a spell for an hour. Then Sam & I went up to Madame Nile’s maison and had some coffee. Return to Baths and a couple of slices of bread gulped down in a hurry – then preparation for a nights stretcher bearing (Orders had come for us to report to our HQ after dusk. so we went accordingly)\n\nIt was felt somehow that a big stunt was going to take place as every available man was marched with us to Suicide Corner where the motors were already waiting. While awaiting instructions a couple of bullets (strays) whizzed down the street & reminded us that a war was on. Later we were detailed into stretcher parties and accompanied by one of the heaviest bombardments I have ever heard we \nwandered\n crept\n\npast Suicide Corner and thro the trenches to Wine Av Aid Post – bullets whizzing overhead the while. On our arrival at the Aid Post we found a very convenient dug out filled with bearers & Capt Clark of 11th F. Amb in charge. The guns ceased after & we saw it was only a blind. We had about 1½ hrs to wait for \nnext\n real stunt so sat quietly whilst outside the Tynesiders who were going over filed past with their peculiar “waddies\" revolvers or whatever they selected.\n\nAt last after a tedious the whole heavens seemed to bark with flame and every gun in the district spat out death to the Huns. Fritz replied at first with a few “minnies\" and one of the boys in our dug out walked to see the fireworks – only to stop a piece of fragment in his chest. There were two of our boys standing immediately in front of him. Another uneventful ½ hr and then – the next 4 hrs was hell. Imagine after a few cases had been bandaged & patched up – a floor covered with a couple of inches of floor & bloody swabs cotton wool shell dressing all over it. Our hands were never free of blood and the fresh blood smell was nauseating \n\nDuring the excitement a wounded Fritz reeled in & while dressing him I got a button as a souvenir. The wounded stuck it well notwithstanding there were some bad cases – abdominal especially. We put thro about 50. When we finished we were trying to stumble about with swabs etc up to our ankles and I had a rotten headache. Bombs fuses gun cotton were lying about everywhere too. At last collecting our stuff we retraced our way back to Suicide Corner and got a welcome cup of coffee. Marched back to Baths & arrived turned into bed at 5.30 in morning.\n","89":"\n\nKept going all day but felt a bit off. Towards night my left eye went crook and suspected last night doings but as it was improved the next morning it was perhaps an ordinary malady. Ben Skelton came in today I had a chat with him.\n","90":" \n\nBombardment this morn.\n","91":"\n\nWriting at night. much warmer now & water running in river.\n","92":"\n\nMost of our boys received instructions to proceed to Erquinghem Baths to commence bathing there tomorrow so at 7 pm a baggage wagon put out & about 30 men leaving Sergt Clem Taylor & self in the orderly Room\n","93":"\n\nwas occupied in transporting stock etc to the other Baths.\n\nNZ officers came to look over Baths prior to occupation.

Did not see what caused it but immediately afterwards saw two Germans making back as a great pace & concluded they were the cause. The falling plane did not come down as quickly as I imagined it would.\n","95":"\n\nRecd instructions to report to Erquinghem tonight so with full pack I in company with about 8 others set out along river bank. And by gee talk about mud & heavy walking and pack seemed about a ton. On arrival at Erquinghem I found good quarters & convenient surroundings & was well pleased with the place.\n","96":"\n\nHeavy day. Letters from Miss Gregory & Ernie.\n","97":"\n\nErnies Birthday (21) \n","98":"\n\nAt night I recd instructions to carry despatches to Pont de Nieppe & went via River Bank thro a pea soup fog & mud up to the knees wearing thigh boots & oilskin & it was a heavy trip. However after delivering\n\nthe despatches & visiting Madames Wable & Nile I returned & on the journey was stopped by 2 officers who inquired my business (it was about 10.30) Got back safely.\n","99":"\n\nThe guns just out in the paddock keep me awake by heavily shaking the place (orderly room) where I sleep on my own. Sam heard from Harold Williams whilst in the office at night a dispatch runner arrived inquiring for an officer and it turned out to be Donaldson from Five Dock. He informed me that Chas Bignall had been wounded in stomach.\n","100":"\n\nRecd letters from bro Ernie & Miss Warren.\n\nRAID AT HOUPLINES\n","101":" \n","102":"\n\nGot word of\n In afternoon Sam some of the boys & self went across to Pont de Nieppe to visit our old friends inc Madame Wable & Nile.

Pont de Niepper looked very gay this afternoon with all the new Zealanders in town.\n","103":"\n\nGot word of another stunt tonight & accordingly had to report to Billets – with all the other boys at 6.30 pm. We were not clearing in the Tenth Ambulance area but were assisting.\n\nMost of our boys had been dispatched to Houplines the “hop over\" area and were held in reserve & told to get to bed at once. Sure enough at 8.30 she started & the sight. After an hour the bombardment eased off & we went to sleep. But at 12.30 she opened again & spit fire all Armentieres seemed to be alive with guns. She did not cease until about 2 am. We slept until 5 when our boys returned with the news that raid had been very successful. Regret to add though that 2 of 11th & one of Tenth Ambulance had been killed & several wounded.\n","104":"\n\nGot back to baths again & saw the raiders with faces blackened & excited and got the news from horses mouth. About 1000 had gone over and they got right to third line capturing many prisoners machines & 2 searchlights besides blowing up a “minnie\" store.

One incident of note Observation balloons were up\n\nand just after dinner a Fritz made a dash across to set fire to one. The occupants seeing him coming got into the parachutes & came down. It was a pretty sight. Fritzs missed with his fire bomb continued on at terrific rate & returned & fired with machine guns without avail. Our anti aircraft made things too hot & he got back to his lines. Then appeared from everywhere our aeroplanes and I counted quite close to us about 12.\n\nDuring the afternoon an Aust mail came & I fared very well getting about 15.

Did not last long but became mushy as the day wore on with more snow. An incident with a Fritz aeroplane created some excitement this morning. An aeroplane could be seen flying towards us – very low and being fired at. We did not realize it was an enemy aeroplane and just above the chimney stack in height. Our anti aircraft shells were bursting very low & a nose cap hit the factory wall just above our heads. There was great excitement for a while. It subsequently transpired that he was brought down near Armentieres. The Germans bombarded a factory in Armentieres today killing 6 civilians & wounding one soldier. treated at our M.D.S.\n","116":"\n\nwriting at night.\n","117":"\n\nQuite a mild day Plenty of excitement. In morning one of our observation balloons was attacked by 3 German aeroplanes and after several attempts they succeeded to setting fire to it & destroying it. Meantime the observers had descended in parachutes. The scene was very pretty. After the incident one of our machines attacked one of German planes but the whole time Germans made a combined attack & our machine had to do some marvelous flying to escape which he did.\n\nDuring the day the guns concealed all around us (5 inch howitzers) opened out & were firing practically all day. Went over to the gun pit of one & stayed there while she fired two rounds. It is wonderful the way the air is disturbed by the report.\n","118":" \n","119":"\n\nRaid on tonight Commenced about 11.30 pm During the barrage Dick Watts & I went over to see the 5\" howitzers in action & came away nearly deafened.

Guard duties continue all day.\n","130":"\n\n SOME SHRAPNEL\n\nVery good incitement this morning which however ended in one of our boys being a casualty. As is customary every morn our Section does physical culture to keep fit & this morning we were on this routine in the courtyard when a Fritz plane came across & sighted us. Consequently in about ½ hr (we were still at culture) whizzing over came a shell & we were soon on our stomach. Never worried much – thought it was a stray & went on again why again – this time she burst in air not far away but we had taken every precaution & no one was hurt. We then received orders to get inside the billets & the Hun kept us his shrapnel all the morning.\n\nWe subsequently learnt that Jim Sullivan had stopped a piece in his arm. Sergt Butcher obtained one of the ‘duds’ half exploded a 5.9 thing & very thick too. We are waiting for the Hun’s next move. At night a party of us went to Nieppe to see the N.Z. Follies of whom we had heard a good deal & they were excellent too. It quite reminded me of Sydney Follies. The orchestra was a star item – one piece they played The Eternal Walz\" being particularly good. During the performance we could hear shells bursting up the road. However we got back after having spent an enjoyable night.\n","131":"\n\nCommenced work this morning at M.D.S. P. Nieppe. Busy with wounded at night.\n","132":"\n\nStill fairly cold.

An officer Lt Stratford was brought very badly wounded and in a low condition. He had one thigh fractured & had lost a good deal of blood. We got to work on him & after the eather he was still very low. The Major ordered saline injection & we injected about 2½ pnts in about 1¾ hrs. After that his pulse was better but towards morning he was down again & Major suggested blood transfusion. Ronny Hill volunteered to give him sufficient blood & one pint was taken. The patient did much better & the next morning had rallied considerably. It was a good safe. \n","140":" \n\nWe awoke to find it blowing a blizzard and with snow. The flakes were about the biggest I have seen. However as if by magic the wind stopped & the sun came out & it was quite pleasant.

A young chap with one leg blown off & the other shattered breaking the bone in a number of places. Major attended & it took about\n\n2 hrs to fix him up.

Went to Bailleul on one of our Ambulances this afternoon with patients & there saw a Fritzs plane that had been brought down by one of ours.\n","143":"\n\nWhen we awoke it was to hear anti aircraft guns going their hardest & we could hear nose caps & shrapnel falling all round us. By the way I might mention that the roof of out billet was of ruberoid stuff & wouldn’t stand too much.

They were Sgt Gus Dyer, Ernie Porter & Harry Bridson. Both the latter have brothers in the Amb. It appears that were taking up the rations to Advance Dressing Station when a shell landed practically on them & cut them up horibly. I saw the bodies & they were a sight.\n\nPrevious ration carts had had narrow escapes & it was wondered that the sending of rations during daylight still continued. Gas drill later.\n","146":" \n\nSleet falling & snowing & cold all day.\n\nWORKING PARTY.

Was just hopping into bed when word came that I was to proceed to Houplines again with the night working party & get the bricks. We drove down as far as it was safe to go in with Waggons. Then each wagon was to dash along the road on its own – with ten minutes interval. Arriving at the post we loaded very fast & got away again smoothly as Fritz sprays machine guns on the post occasionally. However things passed O.K. & we proceeded to Steenwerck where the building a huge Dressing Station was in progress. We eventually got back to billets at 3.30 am & had breakfast then bed. Houplines by the way is in Belgium.\n","151":" \n\nOur slumber was rudely awakened at about 8.30 by the whizzing of shrapnel & perhaps nose caps and as the roof was only Ruberoid I thought it best to get up & put my tin helmet on. On investigating I found that a Fritzs aeroplane was about 100 ft above us & soldiers in streets had a machine gun (Lewis) & rifles playing on him but without effect. Aircraft shrapnel was going dangerously low too. He got away.\n\n Afternoon\n Visited Divisional Baths & had a ‘bon’ bath.\n\nHeard to night that the Coffee stall at Houplines mentioned yesterday was knocked by a Fritz shell about 5 minutes after the boys left. Eddy came back with his head in bandage having been cracked with a brick. Alf Moss went to suffering from T.B. Walk with mac auley at night.\n","152":" \n\nFatigue morning.

To date we had collected about 130 tons of bricks in 4 nights. Germans bombarding Pont de Nieppe & Armentieres rather heavily. I had quite an experience trying to dodge some whilst passing along the road. Met Geo Francis (now Sgt) QM. Fritz very savage today.\n","159":"\n\nTonight was to be our last on working party. It was – but we won’t forget it in a hurry. When about half the job was finished – the Germans raided the trenches just opposite to where we were working. At once our barrage fire opened & the noise gee it was some. We finished loading the waggons that were down there expecting any moment for a shell to come over but we were fortunate.\n\nA couple of machine bullets whizzing quite close decided the issue for us & we decided to run the gauntlet along the open road to safety notwithstanding that during a scrap it is always shelled & open to machine gun fire. However after a very anxious quarter of hour we negotiated the road & heaved a sigh.\n","160":"\n\nUp at 7 \n& with full kit we\n marched thro nieppe Nieppe on to our\n\nunit who had just taken over a new Hospital on the hut system.

Although it is Sunday there is no spell for us & work continues just same.\n","167":"\n\nNight To Follies at Nieppe. Fritz sending over many shells behind Nieppe & shook the ground very considerably. At our new M.D.S. water is scarce & for first time on active service we are washing in ditch water. It has been quite warm lately. Fritz got nothing today in the air as in our sector he destroyed 4 planes & 2 captive balloons. Our new machines are a treat we\n\nrename them the “Flies\". Four of our boys left today for Blighty to join the Australian Flying Corps. Messrs Fred Toby, Joe Bell Harry Wrench & Boyer. All boys having hair clipped.\n","168":"\n\nAnniversary of our leaving Sydney. Still very hot & pleasant after cold spell. Saw Pierrots at night.\n","169":" \n","170":"\n\nWalk at night to Romarin.

Soon after arriving back at Pont d’Achilles there commenced one of our liveliest night to date. Fritz commenced a terrific bombardment and contrary to custom the shells seemed to be all falling in the supports & roads behind the trenches. I proceeded to rear of Camp & from there I got a good view of shrapnel shells bursting about 440 yds away. It was O.K. while they were that far away but whizy \n\nHUN SHELLING EVERYWHERE\n\nand two shrapnels burst almost above my head. On getting the wind of them I was soon down & escaped injury though pieces fell all around & I could the rattle on the tin sheds of the camp. Thinking it time to quit that position I was surprised to find the Camp practically deserted on my return & ascertained that patients personnel horses & cars had been dispatched across the fields it being the CO’s contention that an attempt would be made to strafe the Hospital. \n\nAfter I had set out in search of others quite a number of shells both H.E. & shrapnel fell in close prox to the Hospital. After about an hour the bombard had apparently ceased & we returned to bed only to be called out again in half an hours time Fritz having commenced again. It was then bitterly cold. Fires could be noticed in our lines. On this evacuation I took my blankets & eventually put up in a barn the shelling continuing until nearly dawn. Not much damage was done to Hospital fortunately.\n\nOne of our boys from Charing Cross has just informed us that Fritz shelled the A.D.S fairly violently. Wilfy Boyes was having a bath in a basin of water & when one landed just outside he ran across \n\nnaked to get his disc. Some wag Heard of Billy Elms death down below.\n","173":" \n\nChurch in YMCA hut. Not much doing after last night and we were pleased with the spell. However bets were flying about as to whether Fritz would have us up again tonight but in spite of what we thought we got into bed early. About midnight he opened out again & ironmongery began to fly around.\n\nRather that loose another nights sleep adjourned to the barn across the road & slept comfortably until 6 a.m. It appears that he had a second go about 4 am.\n","174":"\n\nLight duty Rather a cloudy day. In afternoon took a run along to Follies & towards close of performance a terrific bombardment was heard towards Armentieres. Fritz had been putting over gas gas shells shrapnel H.E. etc. at Houplines & other places & soon the alarm got to us. On hurrying back to billets our syren sounded the alarm & men with their helmets at the alert were all instructed to adjourn to the Fields. After half an hour the wind changed and it began to rain – therefore gas was settled. However we were not disappointed\n\nas I witnessed the heaviest bombardment by Fritz since our arrival. The shrapnel simply rained over. Our boys in retaliation sent over a murderous barrage about an hour after which eclipsed Fritzs. Back to Billets & was not disturbed during the night.\n","175":" \n\nLearnt that one of the 11th Fld Amb were killed & \none wounded\n at Brewery Raining today.\n","176":" \n","177":"\n\nTheatre party of Follies. Dick Gates drew cartoon of some of the artistes (Lieut Kerry & Don Nelson) & Bunny Burnside made a presentation of flowers etc after the performance.\n","178":"\n\nConcert in the Parade Hut at night. The Follies (some of them) came down to give us a hand & the whole thing was a great success. Number of our boys returned from the Aid Posts including Sam Crook. We are running an ADS at Charing Cross at present and Aid Posts at Dead Horse Corner Prowses Point. Two men were killed in the next dugout at Prowses Point yesterday & some of our boys suffered from shell shock. Weather still excellent.\n","179":"\n\nStill very hot. Rec’d Australian mail today\n","180":" \n\nToday I had the unwelcome experience of hearing a German naval shell whizz over or really 4 of them. The report seemed to be quite close but I suppose was in reality about 15 miles away the shell travelled fast for we got the whiz almost immediately. Most of them landed in Steenweck a couple of miles further back but not much damage was done. About 9 inch shells they were.\n\nWalked towards Neuve Eglise in afternoon thence to YMCA to church. Place looks good oh now with all the green leaves etc. & it is a pity that the place is being spoiled by this blessed business.\n","181":" \n\nWater party\n","182":"\n\nseveral odd jobs Raising floors of huts etc. At night Alf Henderson & self left for Charing Cross by car – full gear – and arrived there about 8 p.m. Found the place well protected particularly the concrete dressing station. Slept well in spite of incessant barking of 18 pounders which pelted them in practically all night.\n","183":"\n\nDirectly after dinner we left for Dead Horse Corner R.A.P. and after a very pretty walk thro bush eventually arrived there. The woods looking particularly fresh & green reminded \n\n(Plogstreet Wood)\n\nme of Edward Ellis descriptions of Indian life & warfare. The wood was teeming with sandbag barricades breastworks miniature railways hutments covered with sandbags etc. On arrival at Dead Horse Corner found it fairly well protected – not sufficiently well though. It consisted of a half circular galvanized iron structure covered with 2 layers of sand bags. Water procured from shell holes which are numerous. Grave of unknown British soldier nearby. This wood was captured by Glostershires in 1914. \n\nOn looking round I was surprised to see enemys front line just on the ridge in front of me seemly about 100 yds away but probably three times as far and the Germans were on the slopes on other side of ridge. However we hadn’t been there long with over came some Minnies and I clambered up on our dugout to see them burst – enormous explosions. Some heavy 5.9s also came over so I sought refuge in the dugout. Was kept awake at post by the bombardment we gave him but slept soundly afterwards.\n","184":"\n\nRaining constantly all morning but our guns worried him all day.\n\nHe sent a good deal back during afternoon. We had a late tea, Alf & I did cooking. Immediately afterwards a terrific artillery duel opened. our shanty was rocking about rather nastily. It continued for an hour. Not many casualties. Fritz raided but was cut up & he did not succeed in penetrating our trenches.\n\nFriday 18th \n\nWas surprised & pleased to get the news from Major Honman that Sam had won the Military Medal during the heavy bombardment of 5\/6 May. The major was highly elated. The order awarding the medal read as follows:-\n\nNo 1181 \nSgt Crook S. R.\n 9th Aust Field Amb was at Charing Cross Dressing Station during the heavy bombardment of night of 5\/6th","185":" He lost no opportunity in seeing to the safety & comfort of patients & personnel under heavy shell fire. H.E. & shrapnel (20 shell holes are within a radius of 50 yds of dressing station) he assisted at & directed the removal of patients to safety. Later on he led a party to repair holes in the road – removal of broken trees etc. Throughout he showed disregard of personal safety in devotion to duty.\n\nAt night Fritz sent over another murderous bombardment & some\n\nheavy stuff again fell very close to our outfit. In the raid that followed an hours bombardment he again failed & was cut to pieces as before. We had a trip down at about 2 o’clock and had a devil of a job owing to ammunition coming up the line. However we got back by 4 am. \n","186":" \n\nThis morning we got an idea of the damage Fritz did during the bombardment. Hunters Avenue was practically a wreck & trees were across the supply trench. Wantage Hall another of our R.A.Ps was very lucky on several occasions and was knocked about a bit. Major Honman went out during the barrage to Wantage Hall. Gassed. used by Fritz are chlorine which attacks lungs, Phosgene heart, lachraematory or tear shells which affects eyes. It is said that he is using Prussic Acid but have not had any on this part of front.\n\nWe were all very sorry at Major Honmans death by gas he was one of our most popular officers. Lately he has very irritable probably his nerves were shattered at the length of time in action.\n\n \n","187":"\n\nFritz lobbed a Minnie in front of Prowse Point Aid Post which made a hole about 30 ft in diameter & about 10 ft deep. One part of our run down to A.D.S. is exposed to machine gun fire\n\nfor 50 yds but we have safely negotiated it to date. Fritz darent fire his machine gun in daylight as he would be blown to bits in quick time. Young Knuckles West stopped a shell splinter in his hand but it is only slight.\n\nOur working party making a new Aid Post were shelled out this morning. We were relieved for a couple of days – tonight & returned to A.D.S. where the blessed 18 pounders kept one awake all night.\n","188":" \n\nFatigue all day at Charing Cross and at night 4 of us inc Alf Henderson were dispatched to Prowse Point in anticipation of a stunt. From Prowse Point we were guided further up the hillside to a new dugout near The Only Way. We hadn’t been there 5 minutes when orders came for 4 bearers to go to Company H.Q. for wounded. On arrival there they were sent to front line but found to their disgust 4 men killed by a Fritz shell. However they brought the bodies back & reported the matter to Major . They should never have been ordered to the front line for dead men and \nit was known when\n the infantry major \ngave the order\n knew when he gave the order that the men were dead and beyond our aid. However as the business was not expected before 10.30 we\n\nput in our time at playing 500 and the doc (Blumgren) spun a few yarns to pass away time. When darkness Fritzs machine gun bullets began to whizz across the piece of hill over which we were to carry and later an infantry officer warned us that our light was visible. On putting a blanket over the door things were quieter. Time went on and at 10 it began to rain heavily. At midnight a rumour came down with the news that the raid was over – a silent one and there were no casualties. We found it very slippery on return journey & arrived back at Charing Cross at 1.15. No sooner had we arrived\n\nwhich our guns bogged into it like demons & put up a terrific barrage. We could distinctly see some shells in the air the atmosphere being moist. We learnt that the N.Z’s had raided under the barrage. Into bed at 3 am.\n","189":" \n\nStill raining when I arose at 9 am. Left Charing Cross at about 11 am with Ambulance & patients & arrived at Pont D’Achilles Dressing Station about midday. From there we walked (Alf Henderson & I) to Steenwerck Baths and had good hot bath later Passed some 4th Aust Div transports on road coming in. After bath we pushed on into the town (Steenwerck) and\n\npurchasing some sausages found a classy eating house & had them fried with eggs & chips and the whole went well. At first the people didn’t want to cook it as today was a meatless day throughout France. Stroll around for a bit thence return per boat to Pont D’Achilles in time for tea. Was surprised at the number of new marquees (duly disguised) & stretchers about the place. There was a pile of stretchers about 12 ft high & 20 ft long. We were lucky enough to get an ambulance on way back Charing Cross and safely negotiated the road to this part of front and it has been evident that a push was in preparation.\n\nRecently our guns have been peppering Fritz & messines & it is almost impossible to sleep in the lines. A.M.C. work has been hurried on new R.A.Ps (not very solid) new A.D.S. & the colossal M D S at Pont D’Achilles at which there are 6 ambulances (9.10.11.4.12.13) all point to activities soon. Our aeroplanes are particularly busy and live over Hunland some even descending almost on the trenches. We have to sew our brassards on & a green ribbon to denote 9th Brigade and all these things \n\ncan be summed up that the push is only a couple of days off. Today I am spending in making final preparations besides having to sew our Brassard on we were each (the bearers) given a piece of green ribbon to sew round the brassard and our left arm looked something like this \n\nWe are to carry on extreme right flank of movement & to act as pivot thereby getting all cross fire etc. Australians are to attack with N.Z. on 4 mile front.\n\nWhizzies to keep us company killing an unfortunate a little near the front than we were. From our Aid Post we could see Messines. German artillery firing & our shells bursting & the sight was unique & impressing.\n\nHowever Fritz was fairly quiet during night and we made up for our previous nights unrest by sleeping 13 hrs without a break.\n","190":" \n\nFairly quiet. Alf & I cooking. At night a bon Australian mail came in & it was good oh! I despatched a couple away. About dark a violent concussion rent the air and the wind rush past us at a enormous speed. Fritz had got into one of our ammunition dumps. He sent a large number of shells over our heads bound probably for Charing Cross way\n\nwhich Fritz was shelling. On arrival at Charing Cross we got our belongings together & set out through the Subsidiary lines for Wantage Hall & arrived safely to find there an excellent dugout & plenty of room. We found some difficulty in getting thro the trench in parts owing to trees being blown across it during the stunt last Friday and outside of our dugout was quite a dozen specimens of any shells & pieces. A hole a yard away made apparently by 5.9 had cut the dugout sand bags about a good deal and a hole was thro the door apparently the splinter that Knuckles West had stopped.\n","191":" \n\nDown to Dressing Station for rations & water. Afternoon - with Alf toured the Aid Posts thro sunken trench - Rifle House then Dead Horse Cr & returned via Hunter Ave. We sent over some gas tonight & liquid fire. No results obtained yet A heavy barrage was heard a few sectors up north of us.\n","192":" \n\nVery nice day. Saw \nMills Bombs\n outside out dugout today. They are scattered everywhere here. Its shape is: \n\nAbout 4 inches high & 2 ½ ins diameter with corrugations.

About 1 ft diameter weigh about 60 lbs.\n\n‘Pig’ about 3 ft high with 4 fins on base\n","193":" \n\nFritz made it exceptionally warm all the morning and on two occasions I had narrow squeaks. First one – I had just finished shaving – at door of dugout – when whizz-bang and had I not unconsciously ducked, my head would have stopped a number of flying pieces. As it was I got a shower of leaves & sprigs from the tree I was under. A few minutes later I was standing in the trench cooking some rice when bang – and I thought my last hour had come. When I ventured to obtain the culprit that had shocked me I found piece of a nose cap from one of Fritz anti aircraft shells\n\nHe had been belting at one of ours just overhead for about a hour.\n\nAbout midday orders came through for us to process to Dead Horse Cr without a spell as our unit was taking over two new R.A.Ps on the Ridge – Cooks way & The Only Way. To man these shows the whole of C Section had been brought up. We also get the good oil that the stunt was not far off and find preparations were being made.\n","194":" \n\nVery hot today. Fritz again made it warm & shelled & smashed the railway near Wantage Hall. Our bearers at the Only Way were\n\nOUR RAIDING PARTIES\n\nalso shelled out. \n","195":" \n\nAt about 1.30 am we sent a raiding party of about 200 over in Prowse Point Sector but success was limited and only secured 1 prisoner & lost about 80 wounded & 10 killed. Our bearers & effectives had to go at top At Dead Horse we were more fortunate and except for the barrage were not disturbed. I received instructions at noon to report to Charing Cross for another stunt to night.\n","196":" \n\nAt 1.45 one of the heaviest barrages I have witnessed was put up by us and the concussion was tremendous. Soon after the wounded began\n\nto roll in and we didn’t have a spare moment until breakfast time. This raid was more successful as majority of wounds were considerably slight. One case that of protruding intestine was interesting as after the patient had slept for 2 hours he felt better and spoke quite sensibly. We sent him on apparently doing well. Slept as well as guns would allow and without any meal proceeded with Sam & others to view our position in the stunt. One of the dugouts had already been dented by a shell and whilst we were inspecting The Only Way Fritz sent over a \n","197":" \n\nWorking party all day on Messines Road building trench near our new A.D.S.\n\nAt night we were relieved at Charing Cross & had a good sleep at Pont D’achilles\n\nThursday 31st \n\nMorning an excellent bath at Steenwerck.

Sam & I & party of 16 to report to R.A.P. Cook’s way tomorrow night. For the past 6 or 8 weeks now huge supplies of ammunition stores foods & large guns have been hurried\n\nBattle of Messines\n","200":"\n\nHad a decent night out and at 9 am paraded 16 all told including Sam. After a few words of advice from Major we were put in two motor ambulances & hurried away to Charing Cross A.D.S. where we arrived without further incident. On the road we saw some gruesome reminders of a dump that had blown up yesterday at Hyde Park Cr. Party split into two – the idea being for the 16 to work the R.A.Ps during the prelim bombardment. Sam I & 7 others then set out for Cook’s Way Aid Post and had some shrapnel to dodge on the way.\n\nCooks Way Aid Post is in a very exposed position being right on top of ridge opposite Messines. During the afternoon got things in order & dodged a few shells Fritz put over. However we soon became comfortable. After tea orders came for 4 of us to report to The Only Way and I took 3 others along (it was about 150 yds nearer front line) arriving at 8.30. We no sooner got comfortable when in came patients and we sent for 4 more bearers to assist. We were going practically all night in spite of shelling & had some narrow escapes. The trenches in some parts were extremely for carrying thro.\n","201":"\n\nSlept until midday notwithstanding that our position was constantly being searched for a machine gun positions. At noon we were relieved by balance of party and we adjourned to Charing Cross. There we had a good meal consisting of rabbit pie & oranges (gift of Y.M.C.A. During tea Fritz began the woods particularly our portion and from that time (about 5) we were continually being heavily shelled. It was easily the worst night I have had.\n\nAlf & I were on duty dispensing hot drinks. At 10.30 gas shells commenced to arrive and for 7 hours they simply over in dozens at a time. The air was soon foul and we reverted to our respirators. He never stopped for an instant. Four dumps were exploded and we were perilously close to two of them. They were a great sight. Both Alf & I got a couple of mouth fulls and felt very queer. Our eyed were also affected. However we felt better later.\n\n Heavy coughing in a dugout close by we went in and found an infantryman without a mask gasping for breath & took him to Dressing station.\n\nFour of our dugouts were blown in but nobody injured. Dead Horse Cr was also blown in and a bearer killed. (10th Fld Amb). After a short sleep we awoke with an aching head & feeling not too good. Towards morning he finished gas shells & turned H.Es on continuing a heavy bombard all day.\n","202":"\n\nImproved during day. 40 of our boys carried out a brilliant raid on Fritz in broad daylight securing 6 prisoners. It was almost incredible. At 5.30 our party pushed on \n\nthe Only Way Aid Post and as not much was doing we slept as we have never done before. Turning in at 8 pm we awoke at 8.30 next morning feeling OK.\n","203":" \n\nMessines looks very battered and scarcely a thing above ground. At 6.30 pm “A\" Section bearers relieved us & we proceeded Charing Cross. At 9 pm “B\" Section bearers arrived from Billets with instructions for us to go to billets for 24 hrs rest as “hop over\" was to take place tomorrow night or by following morning. Almost immediately we opened a barrage on Fritz with almost every gun and the effect was astounding.\n\nHowever as Fritz commenced to put some stuff back we pushed off to stalk the 4 or 5 mls to our billets at Pont D’Achilles to make the best of a last few hours before the “hop over\". The journey back tonight was a corker & we could hardly realize that Fritz done so much damage. Along the road which he had riddled with enormous shell holes (probably 30ft diameter) houses were burning for mile & shells & the remains of dumps were littered everywhere. It was a sample of the Hun at his best.\n\nDAY OF ATTACK\n\nBack to billets at last (the place looked like heaven to us) and after a drink we bedded it and were soon in dreamland. \n","204":" \n\nSpent the day resting, shaving washing etc. At 7 pm all the bearers were paraded issued with bag of shell dressings etc. and moved off with the wishing of good luck by Colonel. For the early part of the night we were allotted Torque Birth as our waiting place and then came the awful night. At 10 pm the Hun commenced to put gas over and it was Sunday over again. \n\nHe simply rained shells over – in Plogstreet Wood all the roads and in vicinity of all the artillery. By this means all the troops had to pass thro the gas moving up and a good number were gassed. The Artillery were also hampered and could hardly see their sights for tear gas and had to work half hour shifts. However not a man thought of throwing in the sponge. He continued throwing over the gas right up to the attack. After all the men were in position all was quiet except for the whine of gas shells. We didn’t sleep a wink. At 3.10 to the minute our dugout heaved up about 6 inches wriggled a bit and recovered herself. Almost immediately she did \n\nthe same again and we then realized that our mines had gone up and the attack had started. At the same time the artillery opened and the whole country was a mass of lightening and shaking about like an earthquake. As far as one could see the horizon was a mass of flames. This continued for a long time and I think I must have dozed (being on first relief party) and from when I opened my eyes it was to see wounded men walking in and parties of Germans with no more that two of our boys in charge of each party. Then we knew that things had gone well for us, and we were right for the boys gained their objective with exceptionally light casualties and it seems at present that the objective was gained all along the line (the length of which we are present in doubt). At 6 we got the word to start our part of business and moved up accordingly.\n\nThursday 7th\n\nIt was rather a nerve wracking experience moving up for shells were being rained all round us and the rattle of our machine guns helped to make it noisy. However when we arrived at the Only Way and saw the messines ridge and the town we realised how marvelously well our boys had done.\n\nNew Zealanders were on 3rd Divn left flank and English regiments (75th Divn) on our right with our","205":" Divn in reserve). Then we grafted and it was heavy work (we had no sleep or a particle of work since we left Pont D’Achilles and by jabbers it was risky and all of us I suppose almost had trips to somewhere several times. As it was we lost S\/Sgt Jack Hoskins – minus a leg, young Wardell (a Reinf) both who died later. Bill Curry with a piece in his chest and Alf Webber badly gassed. A Fritz was shot down quite early in morning and it was worth recording here that work of Flying Corps was almost perfect as now not a Fritz plane can be seen and twenty of our are easily seen.\n\nAt midday we were still going our hardest still without food when without slightest provocation we felt the wind rush past and next second up went a mountain of earth which descended wounded three quite close to us. Putting our position down in a fairly safe position we stared at each other. Jack Driver Alf Henderson, Harold Lees & self and almost immediately another came over. We then realized that some huge naval\n\nshells were coming across and decided to hop away as quickly as possible. We had a spell just about 2 pm but at two hours later we were astir again and pushing on to Avenue Aid Post. During the afternoon we learnt that N.Zs had to retire 1000 yds but picked it up again soon after. We worked at this R.A.P. until 4 am following morning & returned to Toquet Berth again for a few hours spell.\n","206":" \n\nSlept a few hours first for two days & had some food & felt better. However at 2.30 we had pushed off again for the same Aid Post. The attack was continuing during the afternoon but have heard nothing yet except the barrage Fritz is also putting a heap of stuff back and I have just tried to tourniquet a chaps arm which had been blown off about 20 or 30 yds away.\n\nBack to Torquet Berth at about 6 pm & slept few hours. ","207":" Off again at 2.30 to Anscroft Avenue again\n \n\nAt about 4 pm a tremendous barrage opened and was repeated again about 8 pm each lasting about an hour. They were easily the heaviest to date and the ground simply rocked with concussion. We learnt afterwards that\n\nPrussian Guards had counter attacked but were cut up. The Hun put over liquid gas shells and every other shell he knew but without shifting our boys. Here the excellent work of the Y.M.C.A might again be mentioned for but for them we would not have had a bite of food during the day of attack & following days. Back to Torquet Berth at 6 pm & sleep.\n\nSaturday 9th \n\nAfter rising we did not all go out as usual but two parties went out into Old nomans land and I have to take 4 men out tomorrow at 6 am. Received the sad news that Jack Hoskins had died of wounds. The other ambulances also fared very badly. The 11th Fld Amb lost about 21 wounded or killed & 11th Fld Amb about 8 out of action.\n\nSaw the account of fighting in paper today & it looks good. About 600 tons of explosive was used & 20 mines exploded. The work of our Flying Corps was admirable and during the week of advance over 40 enemy planes were settled by our boys. Gas again tonight.\n","208":" \n\nThings were very warm all day shrapnel & HE.\n\nsimply rained over. One landed just near German collecting cage wounding a man. A squad was sent was sent out to get him and one of boys (10th Fld Amb) was cracked in leg. At 2.30 pm the good news came that some of us were to go to Pont D’Achilles for a spell & at 4 pm we set to tramp the 5 miles. Did not sleep well. Abcess on jaw.\n","209":"\n\nBack at 2.0 pm to Charing Cross & I was feeling very crook & generally run down & neuralgia. Didn’t sleep very much. Fritz lobbed some H.Es near billets all night.

We must have gone about 8 miles like this and arrived at a village behind Steenwerck & Estaires called Doulieu – a very peaceful looking place.

Half an hour later a fleet of enemy aeroplanes came from the clouds and set fire to the balloon after the observers had quitted in parachutes. Immediately our Archies opened fire and there was some fun for a long time. Then the Fritzs set out for two more of our balloons towards Ypres and after a tussle fired them both and made off. It is said we brought one of them down. An hour later two more balloons were up.\n\nThe Archies however had their revenge at tea time & brought \nthe first pl\n a Fritz plane down in the act of firing another balloon. I saw the whole incident – the plane being squarely hit when very close to balloon. After tea we went across & obtained a piece as souvenirs. It was the first I have see brought down by aircraft guns. On my return to M.D.S. I was detailed for Orderly Room work tonight.\n\nCIVILIANS KILLED\n","222":" \n\nEarly this morning the Hun commenced to sling big stuff over close to our Hospital and hit a barn in which a number of Belgian Civilians were holding a Church meeting. \nSeven were killed and\n We immediately dispatched Capt Bertram & a car and it was found 7 had been killed and about 10 wounded mostly women. Two more dead later. It was an awful scene. \n\nSlept fairly well. At about 10.30 just about dusk a large shell came whizzing over immediately followed by three blasts of whistle from somewhere close by. By this time aircraft could be heard distantly and as three blasts are warning against enemy aircraft it was easily seen that some were about. Their object was soon known for soon after quite a number of bombs were dropped in the vicinity followed in half an hour by another lot. Three fires resulted but not much damage and only about 6 cases came thro us.\n","223":"\n\nSlept soundly. At night raining heavily & the expected repetition of bombing did not eventuate.\n","224":"\n\nClear day & rather cool.

One of our balloons (captive) observing for flashed etc. was struck by a lightening flash which ripped the balloon (allowing the gas to escape) and continuing on its way down the steel hawser. The remnants of the balloon came slowly. To date I have not heard what happened to the occupants. Fritz had been shelling the same balloons during the afternoon & two parachutes had left it a couple of hours previously but whether they were “dummies\" or not I cannot say now. Then down came the heaviest rain I have seen for a very long time. By midnight it had almost fined up again.\n","227":"\n\nExcellent day. The list of decorations for our Ambulance in connection\n\n \n\nwith the Messines stunt is out today.

As mentioned about a week ago we were expecting another battle soon. Everything seemed to point that way. Our artillery had been hammering away at the enemy for three weeks and during the last 10 days had increased to the heavy bombardment of the war. This bombardment extended from Warneton (almost opposite to us) right to the coast. Trains were hurriedly passing to & fro along the newly made line with food & ammunition. British Labor Companies had been preparing new railways. Observation balloons – well when I say that with naked eye I could easily see 22 balloons is sufficient that something is doing.\n\nFritz was very nervous also & tried his best to respond to our artillery with varying success. Stretcherbearers from our three ambulance were all warned to be ready & we had our colors (green) issued again in readiness. Last Friday was the day fancied by everyone for the hop over but no - nothing happened and still the bombardment went on. I really believe that that was the original date but HQ altered it for some reason. However here we are on","258":" going about our duties when at (afternoon) word came that every stretcherbearer must be in readiness to push off\n\n \n\nin half an hour. Everything else forgotten we made frantic efforts to get our gear together & in half an hour we were on parade ground in steel hats iron rations water bottle etc & 2 gas masks awaiting instructions. Even whilst there Fritz’s long range gun was putting them into the paddock next door & I can tell you the whizzing of those shells was very unpleasant.\n\nWe were given 5 minutes to get a bite & then we pushed off to march the 8 miles to trenches. Some cursing the Colonel for not providing a waggon but all of good cheer. It had rained that morning & ground was sloppy – hence the trenches must be worse still.\n\nAt length we arrived at Kandahar Farm – our H.Q’s for the stunt – where an Army Hut chap gave us each a drink of artificial lemonade & a cigarette each (the latter being sent from Queen Mary to the soldiers) There we were detailed into parties – Gooseberry Farm – German Dugout – Advanced Fanny – Cross Av R.A.P. – Sunken Road (being the different posts in our Sector (the southern sector) ‘A’ Section had to work the northern sector. The stunt does not start until 3.50 tomorrow morn,\n\nso our party of 6 (Gooseberry Farm) lay on some stretchers at Kandahar until 3 am. In the meantime we dozed. Fritz had also been busy shelling the railway behind us with heavy stuff. Just after 3 we commenced our journey to Gooseberry Farm under the guidance of Sam & had just got to the top of ridge opposite messines when the barrage opened & the sight was a knocker. We could see the barrage also north of us and it was a treat to see the huge line of distress signals put up by Fritz some red some blue. Occasionally a flame thrower would burst & light the heavens\n","259":"\n\nthen one of our fancy rockets would explode – then the 12\" behind us would belch. It was like being in Fairy-land. We knew that the results of the past days bombardments were being tested. (Forgot to mention that whilst at Kandahar we were twice startled by a colossal report which we discovered was a 15 inch gun in the bush 100 yds away. We saw the shell later & were amazed). Then we passed back a little and made a detour round the 12 inch guns (railway guns) expecting them to fire any moment. One did but the wrong one & we were surprised. After travelling the newly\n\nmade messines Rd we arrived after passing over our old front line & Fritzs and the ploughed up country behind at Gooseberry Farm. Then work commenced to put our surplus gear in one of our old machine gun emplacements, surprisingly strong & originally put up in the ruins of a farm. It consisted of two square rooms of concrete reinforced built on top of each other & about 1 ft thick. The machine gun stand was still in position. Our barrage at about 6 pm had somewhat abated but the enemy’s continued.\n\nAt this moment I cannot help remarking at the manner in which the old messines battlefield is ploughed up. There still remains remnants of rifles bombs shells ammunition waggons guns, in fact everything including human bones and the smell certainly suggested the proximity of dead bodies. But however the battlefield had changed considerably since the battle of messines for grass had actually grown over some portions of the ground. \n\nI was detailed to proceed from Gooseberry Farm to a position well forward called Railhead where we received patients from Cross Avenue R.A.P. bearers & proceeded from there to German dugout junction where the next relay carried on. We were exceedingly fortunate\n\nas the day was dull and although we could see the remains of Warneton thro the mist still the enemy could not plainly see us at that moment therefore his shelling was exceedingly erratic. We worked harder than we have for a long time for several hours with excellent results & although there were some miraculous escapes by all of us there were no actual casualties. After going solid until 2 pm we were feeling fatigued & received some reinforcements to assist us. \n\nAfter a few more trips the clouds lifted a little & we could plainly see Warneton (what seemed a couple of hundred yds away thro the trees) and naturally the enemy got better visibility. This was proved a little later as he started to shell our position like & protection was scarce. After being shelled from one position to another we took refuse in a light trench and quite half a dozen lobbed within a few yds of us. Now a lull and we went on with the evacuation of wounded. I heard a machine gun rattle & got down bidding others to do the same & sure enough over came the bullets. This was repeated a few minutes later & we were more careful. Seeing the boys still moving\n\nabout the place he started again & we hopped into a soft dirt trench near by. Quite a few lobbed very close – and then over came one that burst I thought right on top of us. The concussion knocked me silly. I got a head full of noises & something came crash on tin hat which didn’t help. Harold Lees & Chas Hamblin near me were a bit shaken but not hurt much & Chas assisted me this the trench to a German dugout a few hundred yds away & in an hour or so I felt better but shaken up. At 5 pm we were relieved by 11 Fld amb & proceeded to Gooseberry Farm. The boys found room on an Ambulance there for me & proceeded to Kandahar Farm on same\n\n(We could hear the guns of Fritz rattling & assumed a counter attack was in the air) \n\nnarrowly escaping a couple of naval shells which Fritz wheeled across at 200 miles an hour. Then the rain began & it simply poured down, but didn’t damp our ardor as at Kandahar we found three horse ambulances awaiting to take us back to Revelsberg as if we were returning from a football match. A hot meal on return & I went to bed.\n","260":"\n\nIt rained & rained all night & I pitied the chaps still up there in trenches among them being about 10 of our own chaps who could not be relieved yet. On awaking I didn’t feel too\n\ngood & it was still raining & as I had a bon by head I stopped in bed. The news which subsequently came thro was good & we learnt that an advance had been made on a 15 mile front to a depth of 4 ½ miles in one part and the villages of Bixchoote, St Julien, Hooge & other places were captured & 5000 prisoners & 8 guns. Rained has interfered with further action. Germans had counter attacked but we have regained all the ground lost. Our party returned after being on duty about 50 hours without a spell in water up to their knees.\n","261":" \n\nRaining like billeo all day.\n","262":"\n\nStill raining, some cases of rheumatism & bad feet the results of standing for hours up to their knees, began to come in. I got up out of bed today & did a little work feeling a bit dizzy at first.\n","263":"\n\nA queer sight met the eye this morning. Some of the boys clothes were still wet so they were issued with a pyjama suit each & altho it was raining & very muddy, the boys still carried on with jamas rolled up to the knees & slippers on their feet.\n","264":"\n\nWalked to Ballieul & had a hot bath in a house\n\nthat had been belted by a naval shell a few hours earlier.\n","265":" \n\nWeather clearing today & prospects much brighter.\n","266":"","267":" 9th\n\nWeather still against operations though improving.\n","268":"\n\nLetters to home & M.B. & Ern.

Our guns were going their hardest & in spite of light haze we could the bursts in enemy country. One big gun in particular near Dickbusch\n\nlake was a beauty. The Cloth Hall in Ypres could be distinctly seen & seemed quite close to us. Also Warneton & other villages were easily seen. We came down the mount on the north side & endeavored to get a train near Dranout for Ballieul but failed & only got a lift for couple of miles by some American drivers.\n","275":"\n\nTo night Fritz made a determined effort to bomb the aerodrome adjoining us and at same time put the wind up us a bit. Three machines approached from different directions fully laden and soon searchlight go to work. One was picked up and the phosphorus machine guns & archies opened & put up a good fight putting the Fritz to flight. However the other two had had an opportunity to get closer & soon one was picked up directly over us & instantly a tremendous explosion was felt & the wind rushed past us accompanied by numerous sparks & we knew that one had been dropped on the hill about us. Swish & another came but it was a dud. A few seconds after 5 explosions in quick succession followed seemingly a hundred yds away, to discover that they fell in aerodrome grounds & damaged a plane. The holes were quickly covered with grass to prevent the photo\n\nVISIT TO HAZEBROUCK\n\nwhich he was almost sure to take first thing in the morning. He made a second trip but kept clear of Ballieul & presumably went to Hazebrouck.\n\nSaturday 18th\n\nIn the afternoon after we had finished our work Fred Cook & I decided to have a run to Hazebrouck & with that intention we set out at 2.15 pm. Walked to Ballieul obtained a lorry to Meteren. Had the luck to strike an ambulance going to St Omer & had a bon ride thro Fletre, Caestre on to Sylvestre. From there we got another lorry which took us right into Hazebrouck. Saw the damage done by recent shelling & bombing. In two instances two terraces of 3 houses had almost been demolished by shells (15 inch naval variety). \n\nThence to Railway Station after we had a look thro L’Eglise Notre Dame. Saw some chaps from 2nd 1st &","276":" Divisions flitting around. The Hotel de Ville quite a treat to look at. Forgot to mention that while at station the French Poilus leave train came thro’ from Ypres. Place seemed deserted & the people were quitting to the country on account of the shelling. Just before leaving we had the unpleasant experience of seeing a couple of hundred refugees from Armentieres arrive with their belongings. Armentieres was to be evacuated by civvies today\n\nas Fritz would persist in shelling it. We were again fortunate as a little later we got a lorry going to Ballieul for another load of ‘Civvies’ & we hadn’t left the town 5 minutes when a shell lobbed into it just near the station. Back to billets safely. No sooner dark than the nightly visitor came over fully laden with bombs & didnt hesitate to drop a good number but left us sacredly alone as the Archies gave him a hearty welcome.\n","277":"\n\nVery pleased today to receive an Aussy mail & the right sources too. Took a case to Steenwerck C.C.S. in the afternoon & just missed by shrapnel on the main road coming back. Duck shooting at the balloon. At night at 9.15 he made his usual nightly bombing trip but the Archies & searchlights bluffed him off.\n","278":"\n\nIn the afternoon I took a stroll to St Jans Cappel on way to Mont de Cattes. Very quiet place. On the way I saw several old women making lace by bobbins that they used to move & toss about like a machine. It was very clever. To night some trips by Fritz but again the Archies bluffed him.\n","279":"\n\nExcellent day Packing up for the move tomorrow (We are to move out of the lines tomorrow for\n\na spell – somewhere the other side of St Omer) At night Fritz again made himself known but did no damage near us.\n\nWednesday 22nd\n\nUp at 6 am breakfast early and by 9 am we were on the road to Steenwerck Station where we arrived about 11 am. Then we participated in something we hadn’t done for 9 months, Rode in a train (dink carriages) Thro Bailleul we passed Strazele & Borre to Arques where lo & behold we saw some English Khaki girls and they looked – well like jewels after so many months of French faces. Arques looked an excellent little town – the river, the hospital, barges etc. – quite English like. \n\nHere we branched off the main line (this junction being not far from St Omer) & numerous quarries were seen along the route probably chalk pits. In time we arrived at Wizernes where we detrained in fairly warm sunshine with strong wind. Then the march began. I was detailed with others to assist in wheeling the wheeled stretchers. Soon after starting we struck a steep hill & it took the wind out of our sails. However on arrival at top we were allowed to dump our packs\n\nREST AREA\n\nto be picked up later on by our cars. After a very tedious march we arrived late in afternoon at our destination, a small village on the Aa River named Ouve Werquin. After tea some of the boys went for a swim & everything was OK again. Our billets were not too clean though so I with others slept out on the grass although I didnt have a blanket. At about 10 pm I saw shrapnel & searchlights in the direction of St Omer & learnt that Fritz was bombing killing 8 & wounding 28. A rather peculiar meeting took place between one of our boys (Haynes) & some people passing in a car. It appears that they were an Australian & his wife who both live at St Omer doing war work. We are the first Australians to stay at this village, Portuguese preceding us. People quieter than the people near the line.\n\nThursday 23rd\n\nRaining. Walk to river with dad Worsfold Raining at night. Slept in barn.\n\nFriday 24th\n\nRaining in morning. In the afternoon left our village with the intention of visiting town of Lumbres about 7 Kilos away. After ¾ hours walking came to village of thence a little further thro Elnes to Lumbres which was the junction of light & heavy railways of district.\n","280":" contd\n\nSaw plenty of Portuguese en route and on arrival at Lumbres found the place fairly large. Paper factory was a large building but didn’t have time to inspect it. The railway station was fair size. Saw many of 1st Div Pioneers who were quartered in the town & also the British Butterfly Div (19th) Rather a pleasant surprise came when we saw a lion cub in a garden attached to the Divnl H.Q. and later on when we witnessed a tennis match by girls from the local convent. Later we saw the train from Boulogne arrive and was pleased to see some English YMCA girls on board & they sent some papers over for us. Then we caught the midnight railway back to Ouve.\n\nSaturday 25th\n\nWe received orders to move again today from this area (11th Brigade) into that occupied by 9th Brigade. Our billets allotted at a small village called Eseque near Thembrionne which was about 5 kilos from \n\nFaughemberghes on the midget railway. Major Williams had our packs forwarded by car & therefore the march – tho it was hot – was a pleasant one – the boys whistling the while. On arrival we found the billets rather scattered and B Section had to walk perhaps 600 yds to meals & parade.\n\nOur section were fortunate & were handy to everything. After tea I ventured to find a river for a bath but when I found it, it was too dark & cold so I postponed same. On journey I met Ossy Wood strolling along with some other officers of 9th mg Coy & chatted after things for some time.\n\nSlept cold, very draughty.\n","281":"\n\nAfter parade we were free for the day & took advantage by making a tour of country. Dick Gates, Davidson, Lyall Walker & self set out per boot “slicked up\" etc and passing thro village of Drionville where the","282":" mgrs were, we arrived after a pleasant walk at Nesles on the main railway route. Being Sunday the people were dressed smartly & church was just emptying as we arrived at the village.\n\nThis district was occupied by the","283":" (Butterfly) English Divn. Learning that it was impossible to get a train to Desvres we decided to have dinner at Nesles & walk down the valley after. We had an excellent dinner of fried eggs & chips and the people were very sociable in fact one boy was learning English at St Omer College & could speak well. Pushing we had rather a stiff climb to top of ridge but was amply rewarded by the view it affords as one can see for miles.\n\nDown into the next valley & in due course arrived at Senninghem where the people apparently had never seen Australian before. An incident here. I pushed into an estaminet to purchase some fruit. Three Tommy Segts were sitting down & we possibly billeted there. As soon as the lady of the place caught sight of me she hustled me out in spite of my protestations. She though I wanted beer and the hours for liquor are 12 to t & 6 to 8 daily. One of our boys got annoyed at this & told her in Australian that we have burnt down places for less than that. \n\nWe dragged ourselves away & were chatting to a NZ outside and suddenly the old dame came rushing out & could not do enough for us – inquiring whether we were staying in the village etc. Her sudden change of mind was phenomenal . However we ended square there as we left the village laden with 2 hatfuls of apples for a franc & distributed them to Tommies on the road. One Tommy on guard though couldn’t be induced to pick up two we threw him. In time we arrived at Lambres & after some trouble got an excellent meal at Café Francais & waiting for the Boulogne train to arrive we got some papers & caught the midget train again.\n\nSeeing a French officer on the platform with some stomach I enquired of the guard in my best French if he was a Flying Corps officer & as the guard mentioned this to the officer he got a kick downstairs in reward. They took it as a joke though & laughed heartily. It began to rain soon after and visions of a wet tramp back from Faughemberghes came up before us.\n\nWe arrived at Thiembronne (stop before Faughemberghes) at 8.10 and it was nearly dark & raining heavily. There was no shelter & we just had to push on. We were soon drenched & after an hours walk we got to Thiembronne – took the wrong road twice & eventually arrived at our billets at 10.30 drenched & cold – but soon into bed & right O.\n","284":"\n\nStill raining windy & miserable. I was working outdoors all day on odd jobs & it was not very comfortable.

At night it was excellent clear sky & bright full moon. Fritz came over bombing & the sound of his engine could be distinctly heard. Flashes of shrapnel could be seen also.\n","292":" \n\nExcellent day again.\n","293":"\n\nA Sports meeting is to be held next Wednesday (unit affair) and most of us have decided to put the week in training so as to enter for some of the events.

In the morning the novelty events & heaps were run off leaving the more important events for the afternoon. In 100 yds handicap I was on 7 yds & was beaten by Druitt by a hair. He got a good lead in first 50 yds & in a sprint towards the 100 yds I almost caught him. I started in other events – Wheelbarrow race, sack race Siamese race Stretcher race with carrying success. In Tug of war our section were drawn against ‘A’ & was beaten after a good pull. A eventually won the final. The 100 yds handicap was won by Tommy Mahon 100yds champ. 200 yds champ & ¼ mile by Harold Williams. The mile was won by Sammy Watson with Tom Temperley \n\nof our section second.

Squad drill & route march today. To night had a drop with baseball. Tonight 16 of our boys (mostly our section) were despatched with half an hours notice to \nPoperinge\n Godewaersvelde to assist at 41 CCS in connection with the ‘push’. Birkett sprang a surprise today when we learnt that he was appt Capt Chaplin to A.I.F. We all wanted job of Batman.\n","309":" \n\nAfter a mornings squad drill three or four of us were having a crack with the baseball & club when a call came for us to report immediately at motor cars with full gear. Consequently 9 of us appeared with full kit etc.15 minutes later & learnt we were bound for the coast to a place called Hardinghen midway between Calais & Boulogne to relieve 9 of our ‘B’ Section who were supplying an AMC Detail to troops visiting the sea side for a little recreation etc. This sounded all right though we were led to believe that the place was in the wilderness & not handy to anywhere.\n\nHowever we were sure that a view of Blighty across the sea would do no harm. We were soon under way & passing at a good speed the villages of Maison le Boutry & Senlecques were arrived after ½ hours run at Devres where several huge chimney stacks were going their hardest. After an hours run we arrived at Samer rather a nice town (small) and some time later at Pont de Briques station before Boulogne. The approach to Boulogne was a sight I shall not forget in a hurry as it was really the first glimpse of\n\nBOULOGNE\n\ncivilisation on a large scale that I had seen since leaving England in Novr last. We actually saw an electric tram, gliding along full of humanity & some pretty humanity included & felt quite at home again. Passing thro a very fashionable quarter we arrived at the Quay and saw myriads of masts & it was indeed a picture. Some French sailors – some pretty visitors – nurses, wounded boys etc all thrown in made the picture complete. Next came the ocean itself & what a relief it was after feasting our eyes on desolation. Quite Manly-like.\n\nPassing the beach we got on the hill on northern side of town & could see miles & miles up the coast and almost to our surprise we could see that in spite of the Huns boasting of ‘U’ Boats, I could see shipping going on apparently just the same. The surf was not quite as big as our beaches but showed promise the beach as I remember it not as big as Manly or Coogee. The surroundings were highly colored & looked like a fair land. Our car stopped on hill for a while to give us a chance to visit the Exped Canteen & take in the surroundings.\n\nThis northern hill was simply covered with hospitals & the place had a nice fresh new & clean appearance. On the move again we passed thro the city of hospitals & this continued as far as Wimereaux (where the 2nd Aust Gen Hosp was) & Aust Voluntary Hosp also. Also saw some Bosche prisoners on road work. \n\nThrough Ambleteuse & Andreselles we went & at latter place we could just see the dome of a building in Boulogne in the distance. In due course we arrived at our destination Tardinghen & place the place not very much to our liking but not too bad considering.\n\nVISIT TO WISSANT\n\nHowever we were astonished when we discovered the camp would be closing in a couple of days. The camp is practically on the beach and from here we can see quite handy the Cape Gris Ney and it the other direction the village of Wissant. After tea we went for a walk along the beach to Wissant and the place didn’t seem to get any nearer. Distance is very deceptive when travelling along a beach. I might mention that the beach is some miles in length – and perfectly flat but surf is not very good as one can walk out a good way before reaching\n\ndeep water. After an hours walk we came to Wissant and words fail me in describing the beautiful of the place as viewed from the sea side of it. It was for all the world like a highly painted picture – each \ncottage\n house a different color yet the colors were so selected \nblended\n as not to abuse the blending. The houses did not take up much groundage but the general is to make them look like doll’s houses. Passing Wissant we came across a U Boat cut in halves well up the beach & surrounded by sight screens. This was the object of our walk & so we made a quick inspection before it got dark.\n\nFrom what I could gather from the French sentinels guarding it, it appears that she lost her way on","310":" (about 2 months ago) and ran ashore but was immediately fired on by coast batteries & hit twice. The commander decided to blow her up which he did & evidently he & 26 men were taken as prisoners. We scrambled aboard after going thro water ankle deep in the thing was bigger than she looked at first. I secured some copper \n\nas souvenir. The French guards were clad in a kind of combination hood & cloak. \n\nOn way back a colossal searchlight could be seen searching the channel – probably from a warship. Cape Gris Nez lighthouse was also easily visible. Slept well.\n\nSaturday 22nd \n\nFood not too good. Could see hydroplanes patrolling channel also balloons & destroyers as well. Later in morning had a beautiful view of the whole cliffs of England and made us wish we were there. They really seemed about 5 miles away. The main portion of camp was struck in the morning. At night we walked to Wissant & had good look at the village. It was excellent. Easily the prettiest village I have seen. Belgium Soldiers billeted in village – looking very neat & clean. Sir Doug Haig inspected the Div.\n","311":" \n\nEarly in morning it was clear that we would be rejoining our unit so decided to make the most of things by having a surf bathe. It was very cold in the water & we had to walk out about a mile before we struck water – as tide was out. Swim over – we put back to\n\ncamp & dined rather well considering. Just after dinner I counted 25 ships in the Channel and they say the “U\" Boats are winning. About 3 pm our lorries arrived & we were soon on return journey. Passing thro Wimereaux (it was Sunday & the towns are looking their best) we came at length to Boulogne. It was just like holiday time & the dressing was quiet OK. A British band was playing at the beach and except for the fact that ‘Kahki’ & blue were in evidence we would hardly realise a war was on. \n\nWe arranged for the drivers to stop here an hour to give us a chance to look round and it was worth it. The beach was very pebbly & not up to the aust beaches. We left Boulogne about 6 and when we arrived at Devres via Wisquenes it was quite dark. We pushed on after 10 minutes spell and arrived back at Ecurie about 9 pm. The news on arrival was not too good as we were led to believe that the Division would be going back to lines again in a few days.\n","312":"","313":"\n\nAll hustle loading waggons etc in preparation for moving early tomorrow morning. I was detailed as Wagon Orderly for the three days march in front of us &\n\nTHE 3 DAYS MARCH TO YPRES\n\nas a consequence had to do picket from 3 to 4 am (Wed)\n","314":"\n\nReveille at 4 am (very dark foggy & wet) We soon had two or three bonfires going with the waste wood & rubbish and they acted as good arc lamps. At soon after 6 am the long march & most of our packs were not feeling at all light. My work was wagon orderly to a limber wagon & of course had to work the brake. my pack was not carried all way though as occasionally I managed to niggle it on the back of limber. \n\nBy midday we had passed through Drianville & Elnes and on arrival Lumbres we halted for a few minutes. I met Harold Bastian & - Kay (bro to J.W.K.) who are attached to 9th Engrs here. After about another ½ hour we had dinner (or bully & bread) and set out again at 2 pm. Following the main road we eventually left Wizernes behind and \nsoon after\n couple of hours later St Omer was in sight looking A1. Passing this town on southern side we came to Arques on the river & got some fruit which was acceptable. At Arques are a number of CCSs & quite a number of Hospital barges take badly wounded\n\ncases to Abbeville (?) There are also quite collection of Khaki girls (WAAC) working on military work. N Zealanders also on the march had arrived at this place that afternoon & so the town was full of them. Passing thro Arques we continued in sth easterly direction & reached our destination just on night fall. It was the village of \n\nAfter looking after the horses at which I assisted it was bedtime & we slept in a barn. I had to do picket from 4 to 5 am next morn & it was raining slightly.\n","315":"\n\nUp at 7 am and set out again on our march at 8.30 am. Passing Ebblinghem, Syvestre Cappell, Eecke we came to Godewaersvelde (where our party from C Section were at CCS) passing to the south of Cassell. We arrived at Godewaersvelde at about 8 pm and in the dusk could see Mont des Cats quite plainly. To night was exceedingly clear & our planes were continually travelling across to Fritz laden with bombs. Slept in a barn again.\n","316":"\n\nLast day of our march. Set out for last spurt at about 9 am and passed thro Steenvoorde – where we saw hundreds of Anzacs\n","317":" 2nd, 4th & 5th Divs.\n\nAt midday arrived at Winnezele our destination & was quite pleased that the thing was over. Walked thro village after tea and it was quite lively. Brought back memories of George St on Friday nights except that this crowd was all Khaki.\n\nSaturday 29th\n\nMorning. Assisting the drivers with their harness. We had arranged cricket & football matches for the afternoon but had no sooner prepared everything for play when orders came for us to pack up at once in anticipation of an early move up to the trenches. Consequently our Section were ordered to fall in with full gear at 5.30. We were there all right and after inspection by the Colonel we thought that we would soon be moving on – but were disappointed. \n\nWe were kept on the ground for several hours more and as there were no signs of transport to take us up to the lines. Enemy planes bombing in the evening interested us for some time & as it was getting cold we decided top rest in the barn. We were enabled to have a few hrs sleep by this \n& in the morning we were ordered to stand by until the afternoon\n \n\nSunday 30th\n\nStanding by was \n\nYPRES\n\nvery monotonous so we arranged\n \n\nsoon after breakfast we were ordered to move again & this time it was not a false alarm. Aboard motor lorries we were soon whisked up to the great noise. Passing thro’ Steenvoorde Abeile Poperinge (big town) we eventually came to the ruins of Ypres – the scene of so many battles and what a mess things were in. It was a fairly hot morning & business seemed to be in the air. The road was “chock ablock\" with all descriptions of transports motors trops guns ammunition everything required by an advancing army.\n\nYpres, if pronounced “Eaps\" just about describes it. It was colossal. Just a mass of bricks & brick dust and in the green fields – full of shell holes.\n\nWe arrived in due course at the Prison (passing Von Bissings private residence) and here was to be our main dressing station – and very substantial too. Our lorry after reporting pushed on to the 1st advanced dressing station and even here, in full view of Fritzs balloons the roads were very congested apparently unheeding of the danger of being blown up any minute. At A.D.S. (murder Farm I think it was called) we disembarked as this was the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfarthest the lorry was allowed to go. Just here I would like to mention what a mess of bricks the Cloth Hall was in and it is said a couple of battalions of Tommies are buried under them. On the farthest side of town there is a huge wall & moat outside of that again. The wall is riddled with shells. After Ypres behind the desolation etc was indescribable and even our road was cut to billeo. Dropping our nursing men at A.D.S. we pushed on per boot and soon entered the danger zone. Yet all along the roads were working Labor \n\nBattalions & hundreds of other men on working parties.\n\nAt Bavarian House we turned to the right and was soon passing thro a veritable crop of guns & ammunition. The guns were wheel to wheel here & each gun pit stocked full of shells. The noise was deafening and if Friitz had sent any over near us were could not have heard them. He did land a few uncommonly close too. After 20 minutes walk we passed thro the guns & we arrived at the railway or what was left of it & Sam’s party took over the A.D.S. here – called Lone\n\nWood. Then we followed the railway up towards the front line and what a picnic we had following that railway. Lumps of railway sleepers barbed wire etc sticking up every yard & the whole riddled with big shell holes. The Tommies had put a white tape down as a guide for night carrying. At last we arrived at Rabbit Villa – a pill box designed to hold two men & as there eight of us the remainder had had to shelter as well as they could. This was to act as our relay post and we had to carry down the railway track to Lone Wood.\n\nThe day was fairly quiet from our point of view and we learnt afterwards that our boys couldn’t get the wounded in from the shell holes as Fritz was sniping the stretcherbearers – wounding two of them. As soon as darkness came though patients simply rolled in & chances of a sleep dwindled. And what a carry we had too. Up & down shell holes tripping over barbed wire or rails & all the time Fritz shelling hell out of everywhere. It was miraculous we got 10 yds without a scratch. A N.Z. party were laying a cable quite near to us & a plane sighting them, soon brought hail of shrapnel & H.E. \n\nSgt Lees party were carrying to us for Railway Dump\n\nZONNEBEKE\n\nconsequently two were wounded & on calling for stretcherbearers I went across & got them & took them to the Dressing Station after applying a field dressing. Forgot to mention that the ground we were walking over was only captured a few days ago and the stench of dead bodies was overwhelming. Plenty of horses too. From our pill box we could see Zonnebeke quite plainly & the also the ridge which was to be our next objective. On our right was Westock & Polygon Wood also. \n\nWe were situated on the ridge opp Zonnebeke & there were pill boxes all along the sky & of course he had a nasty habit of shelling them. The night was moonlight & that assisted us considerably. At about 4 am distress signals went up & soon our guns & Fritzs too were hammering away like billeo Probably a counter attack. At 7.30 we put up a special try out barrage & it was great to witness.\n","318":"\n\nSam was in a larger size \npill box\n dug out nicely finished off & with electric fittings. At about 11 oclock I went down to Lone Wood for a doze as things had quietened down a bit. \n\nFritz balloons were up & still the work behind the lines continued. Awoke again at 5 pm & back to Lone Wood in time to get a harvest of cases. At 7.10 pm an SOS went up & our barrage was turned on again. Another counter attack. Sam told the story of finding as dugout with 2 Fritzs & 2 Tommies bodies in & the top blown in. At 8.30 we gave him another exhibition barrage & such a sight. Mac & I sat there & watched the flashes & it was indescribable. Before it finished a case came in & we had the roughest trip I ever experienced. \n\nWhen half way a 5.9 bomb on our track in front & cracked us with the earth – hurting Jack Driver slightly. A couple of seconds later one burst on our right & almost blew us over. Pushing on two more burst uncomfortably close & how we escaped I do not know. When we returned to dugout I opened a parcel which had just arrived from MB & for a few minutes had some feast. Ginger, nuts, lollies, cheese, paste, chocolates butterscotch etc. all went with a swing & how the boys enjoyed them. Then another case and when I returned I sat outside the dugout as we had\n\nWOUNDED\n\nto give two of the boys chance of a sleep. Fritz was still shelling & a 5.9 bursting about 15 yds away sent over a piece our way & I stopped it the back of shoulder. Corp Mac soon had a field dressing on & I went on my way rejoicing to Lone Wood thence to Bavarian House where I got on an Ambulance. Stopping at Murder Farm for another dressing I was sent to our M.D.S. at the Prison where after another dressing I had a sleep for about 3 hrs & in morning\n\nTuesday 2nd\n\nI was dispatched to Walking Wounded Depot where I received an injection & from there to Corps Rest Station between Poperinge & Watou where I arrived in afternoon. Wound fairly sore but doing OK.\n\nWednesday 3rd\n\nDoing well. Do not expect to be out long. There are all sorts & sizes of troops at this Hospital. West Indians Scotties N.Zs Ausies Tommies etc. One chap said his Coy was “moppers-up\" in the recent advance. Towards night the Ambulance working the Hospital (10th) had word to proceed up the line to assist our Amb so evidently the hop over is tomorrow. My luck seemed to be in tonight and soon I found\n\nAT C.C.S.\n\nmyself being whisked away to C.C.S. No 10 C.C.S. between Poperinge & Abbeville.
