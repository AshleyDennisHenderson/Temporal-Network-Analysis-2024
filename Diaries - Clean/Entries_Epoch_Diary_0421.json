Rumors: - that the Majestic though holed is still afloat Teddy Henderson is ok although on leaving the Triumph he had a severe shock & is to be ordered away for a change.

I met Paddy Hansen & Merv Knights Merv expects to be transferred to Popes early in the next week.

Col Brown was shot, when morning broke Hal & I paid a visit to the O Station & had a go at sniping, the trenches were in a hell of a mess & the Turks presented beaut targets for they had practically no cover & we made splendid practice. After lunch we again had a go but they were much more wary & the cover T were in good order again. Hal & I decide to make a fresh home adjacent to the main saf, after tea paid a visit to Giley & gave him all the news & what had happened last night.

The Monitor opened fire on the Turks transport today & did good practice with their 6\" gun. Isla Tepe has not shown up lately for a wonder. I received another 3 letters today two from home & the mail is expected tomorrow. Worked on our new home all the afternoon & succeeded in finishing it & we took over at 5, & are having a house warming tonight. Rumored that the monitor succeeded in bagging the 6\" Howitzer the Turks were bringing up per traction engine we couldnt reach it yesterday but had to wait until it came within range, so hope its true.\n","166":"\n\nThursday\n\nPaid a further visit to the \"nook\" & fired another 100 rounds each, one Johnny proved a sport for when I fired he would mark with his shovel till the fourth shot when I \"marked\" him.

Two more batteries of arty were brought up into position last night & we expect a warm time shortly when the Turks start searching for them, that gun at Tepe was put out of action a day ago & now one can bathe in piece, the 6\" Howitzer accounted for it but the Turks have brought another on the other flank but they cant do much harm.

Tom W who had only returned from Helles this morn said that their L flank was nearly in contact with our R & that they are 7 miles inland from the Cape. They landed 25 shells on the Base through the day.\n","168":"\n\nSaturday Mail Day\n\nUp at 7 to the tune of a bombardment of the enemy with shrapnel & some are coming too close for my liking.

The shrapnel was bursting all round us this morning & our cook house was peppered with splinters of shell. One of our latest planes came over at 6 PM & dropped three bombs on the Razor, they seemed to burst with considerable force & we expect good results. Turks are reversing their bullets for some reason or other, further mail arrives but still no sign of Nell’s, another 6\" gun is landed on the beach & is to be brought into action at night Masters gets news of his com at last & is quite jubilant of the affair\n","170":"\n\nMonday 34 wks from home\n\nIt is rumored that we landed more troops between Gaba Tepe and Cape Hellas & troopships were seen leaving there early this morning the Cruiser accounted for all the reinforcements, German) The enemy were bringing up a further heavy bombardment opened up this morning and our 6in gun did splendid work – also our lighter pieces.

I met Ted Griff & Geof Shep today down at the beach. One of our destroyers shelled Gaba Tepe & the enemy in return was dropping them all round her but that’s as near as they got. Two of our aeroplanes were busily engaged one in looking for submarines & the other on reconnaissance the Turks dropped a shell or two pretty handy. Influenza pretty prevalent with troops. The circular regarding applications for commissions in regular & territorial army has again been put before the troops with an urgent appeal to all COs to encourage men to go for them. Corp Knight is still in the land of the living \n","172":"\n\nWednesday 44 wks of soldiering\n\nAnother heavy bombardment to wake us at dawn & they kept us on the move to some time, shell after shell came down the valley & got one of our sniper pals in the thigh. After lunch Hal & I went to pay a visit to a friend of his on Steels Post & there I met Pere & Eric both are well & in good spirits, they are now in a machine gun section & have been doing some rare shooting at time, while we were up there the Turks opened with their arty again & it didn’t take us long to get out of it, when we go down to our quarters we were informed that Bill Steele & had stopped a few about them, then next shell Metcalfe stopped the case with his leg it made an awful mess of it tearing the flesh away & leaving the bone bare to some length I saw all of them fixed up & then got back to tea. Made application again today for commission at home & hope its ok this time met Fatty down at the beach he is with the 4th arty reinforcements. Stopped one myself in the knee. Alright.\n","173":" \n\nThursday \n\nMore arty at break of day its getting quite the order now for a salvo of shell to awaken us during the night the enemy erected many \"gabions\" & these had to be destroyed by arty today Sykes baty was employed & in 24 rds he did the job but it drew a heavy fire in return from their guns. A Turkish patrol surprised one of our m guns & shot the gunner the remainder inskied leaving the wounded man to tend the gun this he did & accounted for all the visitors I might say that they came from NZ. Went for a swim today & after that on a hunting tour I got 6 today and 6 yesterday, am not feeling a scrap lonely of a night now All lines patrolled this morning & are now in first class condition, all going along satisfactorily at last, changed time to full Navy today & coded in just the same..Mail expected tomorrow, Rations cut down by half no transport. No word of our wounded. \n","174":"\n\nFriday (Centenian?) of Waterloo\n\n(annotated 50)\n\nWrote home & Nell\n\nOur engineers opened up new trenches last night but owing to decomposed nature of bodies laying about they had to abandon them, enemy used many star shells last night & this morning we had another visit from Jack Johnson he landed 4 within 30 feet of HQ one in our sap but beyond blowing up a lot of soil he did no damage, warships have been bombarding Helles & here all day long we hear that we are to move forward in a day or two. A bomb throwing competition was carried out today at Quinns & the Turks were quite annoyed at the reception they got. Visited the snipers today & made preparations for further visit tomorrow & as plenty of work is promised us we wont growl. An issue of rum to hand on account of the centenian of Waterloo the boys wish there was one every week. Enemy have bought 18 pds to bear on us Oh hell!\n","175":" \n\nSaturday \n\nPlenty of bomb throwing all night & artillery as norm as day broke, shrapnel 18 pds mostly one of our planes put in an appearance about 8.30 & was heavily shelled for miles but escaped unhurt. Our field guns were placed in position at Coutneys tonight & are expected to open fire any minute now. All day since 4.30 am have been bombarding Achi heavily this I believe is the supreme effort & we hear that the Tommies are in pretty well the last trench. The Turks have been withdrawing for days every available man from us & sending them to Achi the Monitor caught a column on the march two shells finish Turks. At 6 another of our planes put in an appearance this time they gave her both shell & m gun fire but she in her turn dropped two beauty bombs right on their trenches another 6\" gun landed today we dont know where it is to be placed yet. We fully expected a mail today but it hasnt come to hand as yet. Finished up for the week at 12.\n","176":"\n\nSunday 6 wks of action\n\nNothing of much note during the night only a little bomb throwing a heavy cannonade at Achi after dawn they gave us heaps of shrapnel both in the valley & on the beach & when Hal & I were in for a dip they infiladed us both from Kaba Tebe & Fisherman but no one was hit though, down at the Cape the Turks put in 300 8\" shells in 3 hrs & got on to our transport department. I met Frank Carter today for the first time & also Merv Knights. Another 6\" gun on the beach she is a beautiful model & ought to shake up our friends once opposite. The Engineers blew up one of the submerged barges. Church was held at the rear of Courtneys Post & it sounded beautiful to hear the singing between the reports of both rifle & gun & the conclusion all the troops sang the National Anthem & it was carried right along the line.\n","177":"\n\nMonday 35 wks from home\n\nWe attacked per rifle all along the line to estimate the true strength of our friends over opposite but met with only a feeble response. Hal & I were up early after snipers & Hal got another notch after lunch I went down to the beach for the usual & just missed a Johnson it landed 6 ft away & didnt bust. I received great news down there the French had taken a mile of trenches & large bodies of Turks were reported (per aero) to be moving in a NW direction right into us, they took also an entire line of 2 trenches & held them. Mail arrived but I only got 3 papers. The Engineers finished the Pier today & it has been called \"Watson Pier\", oil engines have been installed for pumping purposes. Any amount of artillery from the Turks & high explosive stuff at that they have been trying to get on to the tunnel from Steels point but beyond giving our chaps some spice hunting they havnt done much damage. Bridge till 10\n","178":"\n\nTuesday\n\nUp with the larks & off sniping only saw a couple though & pull their house down about their ears, plenty of arty again from daylight. Aeroplanes in sight 2 at 8 pm one ours & one theirs both our arty & theirs blazing away for all they are worth. News of yesterday confirmed. After lunch have a little fatigue work to do then make up our minds for a dip, beach closed as high exp shell is taking it but we get through & are OK until on the return journey when one ought to have got us but didnt. A Montor assisted by aeroplane is bombarding Gala Tepe with lyditte for all she is worth the effect of the shell is awful, & debris is flying about in heaps, the Turks have in turn sunk one of our water barges so mifish moia for today. Bert Fitton & Irving are back with us from the Cape again. Met Charlie Laurie OK. Paid a visit to Bill Nelson for bridge & nearly got another shrapnel it touched Hal only\n","179":"\n\nWednesday 45 wks of soldiering\n\nSniping again at 5 light pretty bad but succeeded in giving one a start. An aeroplane was over early this morning & very low to so something is doing at the back of our position they were hovering there pretty well all day. Went for our usual at 3 pm & the Turks were pumping shrapnel in for all they are worth, they bombarded our positions to far into the night & high explosion at that. The effect is very pretty although pretty dangerous, quite a bomb battle opened up at 7 & for every one they threw we threw two & they quick turned it up. Things were as far as rifle fire went very quiet all day. Our howitzers get on to the gun opposite & Sykes lets his guns loose for once they make good practice on the gabions but the Turks quickly repaired them by next morning. The gun opposite Courtneys gave our parapets hell & blew one poor chap to bits & wounded others. No luck com again not for our brigade but paper will come in handy for future use.\n","180":"\n\nThursday\n\nHad quite a battle with a sniper opposite but we with our periscopes sights got the beggar he was persistent & a good shot. The expected attack didnt come off last night & our chaps are quite disappointed. The gun opposite C is still giving the beach hell & one shell got 17 of our chaps, gunboats are shelling him with 4.7 but the range is to short for they are in a pit of considerable depth. A Glasgow battery (6\" howitzer) has been landed to give us a hand. The Turks gave us a pretty exhibition of gunnery, one of steam was bringing in a barge of goods & the Turks were trying their hardest to hit it they got within 10 yds every shot but no nearer. Had quite a lively 80 minutes Hal & I went a hunting & bet. us we got 50 & now we have a clean change on French & British still progressing favourably down at the Cape & Achi is in for a lively time. We hear that we had 500 000 Turks opposing us when we landed, but how many they have now is another story.\n","181":"\n\nFriday\n\nDuring the night we captured a Turkish patrol consisting of 1 officer & 7 men, the officer informed us that they are confident if they wait long enough that they will starve us out & that also we are trying to find water everywhere but without success. The Lord Nelson with her 4 12\" guns & 18 9\" shelled Chanak from off our position for the whole afternoon. The burnt cordite formed a pall over the whole countryside, later on in the evening Chanak was on fire in many places, the Lord N had a cordon of 18 destroyers to protect her against submarine attack. A mail arrived at 5 but none for us as usual. At 9 pm we blew up a mine & launched an attack to try & find out the strength of the enemy, it proved successful all along the line. Went for our am dip accompanied by mine shrapnel. German aeroplane passed over at 6 pm & made straight for Maidos, our captive balloon was up spotting for the L Nelson All the afternoon the Turks gave an exhibition of battery fire & tried to blow up the L Nelson, also the balloon came in for its share\n","182":"\n\nSaturday\n\nTook bad with an attack of ptomaine poisoning at 4.30 due to a crook temperature up to 101 so am off duty for today. Mustard is back & brought a mail with him, I was lucky enough to receive four letters a paper & 1 parcel & the long looked for letter from Nell, the Turks have been very quiet for the last few hours only plenty of shrapnel as usual but our how are proving their superiority everywhere. We took over again at 12 noon worse luck & work for another week is in progress. Aeroplanes both ours & theirs are to be seen at any time. Ward returns from Mountain Battery & who was hit with a bit of a bomb was sent up to relieve him. Our guns have been concentrated onto the New Turks position up the head of Snipers Gully, we blew their defences to blazes & gave them heaps of work for a few days, 8 high explosives were put into the gabions opposite & now they none but they have been very busy all night, rumor of a relief for us\n","183":"\n\nSunday\n\nI have made fair progress towards recovery & temp is down to normal, Pere Parki was wounded by trying to smother a bomb & received 3 wounds one in the thigh being his worst, Artillery very brisk all day & the enemy has got a battery of 4.7\" shelling the beach & they are landing very close to H.Q, the heads are in quite a stir over it, they succeeded in sinking another of our barges with 4 days supply of water on board, things are very active round towards the cape. Whilst sapping last night our chaps ran into a Turks sap & a pitched battle ensued, rifle, bomb & revolver being employed they we placed an armed man over it who shoots on sight. I went down to the hospital to find out the latest re Pere & on the way down I had the narrowest escape possible from a JJ just whizzed past my head & exploded 5 yds off beyond getting a bath in dirt nothing happened, he is getting along as well as can be expected\n\n \n\n28 June 1915\n\nMonday 36 wks from home\n\nA heavy bombardment took place opposite Gabe Tepe & 15000 Scots are reported to have been landed there we could observe cruise shelling shore heavily with shrapnel & the destroyers are yapping close into the shore our right flank opposite the Lonesome Pine had advanced & successfully taken the 1st trench of Turks they then went on & took 8 more but had to retire as our ships out at sea were shelling these trenches. News from the Cape says that our troops have advanced 1100 yds & taken 5 lines of trenches troopers are everywhere around the coast The Monitor has been firing all day & JJ has dropped 8 in our lines but have done no harm. We had fairly heavy losses but we must look for this when such operations are ordered. We expect a very heavy counter attack tonight but are in the best of health for it swimming at 7.30 is great, We blew out another MG by our 18 pounders \n\n29 June 1915\n\nTuesday Pere died yesterday\n\nThe counter came alright a real beaut they attacked all along the line, we were greatly helped by the aid of our star shell as our positions had been consolidated throughout the early part of the night they found it more than they could do. A heavy bombardment was going on all day today down at the Cape & quite a number of fires are breaking out all over the hill. The French advanced another 350 yds & held it. The 1st Brig is off for a spell to Imbros the 1st &","184":" Btns Heavy artillery fire has been directed on us all day especially down at the beach where high explosive has been playing all day doing a fair bit of damage Our losses for the advance were 250 so we did extremely well, an aeroplane was up during the attack last night we couldn’t find out who she belonged to, but not much importance is attached to the fact as the night was fairly dark\n","185":"\n","186":" 46 wks of soldiering 7 wks of action\n\nYesterday all day along the whole line the enemy attacked heavily but was repulsed with heavy loss, about 100 Turks left their trenches last night at 12.10 & attacked Walkers Ridge, then first of all struck our outposts who turned them to our right where they struck Popes, rifle fire laid them out & they retired (into our MG) in disorder, meanwhile one of our MG had been placed outside the parapet with this gun we either killed or wounded every man, 35 dead can be counted opposite Popes alone, 3 prisoners were caught & two officers, 1 Turk & 1 Ger no information could be gleaned from them. The French made important advances again today at Helles. Artillery gives us blazes again all day & High Explosive has been landing in our cook house but luckily no one was about, at the beach they got it pretty warm. Snipers again prevalent\n","187":"\n\nThursday annotated 52\n\nDuring the night a most violent thunderstorm came over from the South & our friends on the other side made the most of it by attacking but they only got bad for their pains, Enver Pasha has resumed command of the Turks again & has ordered us off the Peninsula at all costs. Advanced report from Helles today says that during the last two days the Turks have left 1500 dead on the field & they are getting greatly disheartened their equipment is also of the worst, canvas most of it & some have only slippers for boots. Met Eric P & went to the beach with him to try & find out about Pere, things are booming again at the Cape & the heavy guns have taken up the music again, a heavy sea has been running all day & has caused some damage amongst the works on the beach Created a bomb proof shelter over the Signal Office. Snipers got three this morning. Only a couple of hundred shells today\n\n \n","188":"\n\nFriday\n\nFirst thing this morning a large box kite was flown with a camera arrangement above our trenches, by some contrivance, papers were flown into the enemy’s lines . The mountain gun of the evenings did considerable damage to Popes defences this morning so at 11.30 our \"How is yer\" baty opened fire with lyddite & they created awful havoc in their trenches but somehow didnt manage to get the gun Our land & sea guns started another heavy bombardment down at the Cape today & its even heavier than the last. A sniper was observed digging himself in at 6 on the Razor & one of our m guns gave him a hand & now he’s not digging in. Two of our planes came over tonight one dumped bombs & the other reconittered the evenings position. One sniper caught last night by the 1st LH & found to have been armed with our rifle & ammunition. Another bomb (catapault) came over Courtneys tonight into a cook house & wounded the cook\n","189":"\n\nSaturday\n\nHeavy arty has been directed against us all day & in return our howitzers have wrought awful havoc with lyditte in their trenches, they have dropped a few high explosives for distribution amongst us. The chaps down at the Cape have done splendid work & have practically decimated two divisions of the army They attack as usual with arty & infantry but this time in the broad daylight as that accounts for their huge losses they can now be seen from our position, from hill 701 at Anzac it is quite possible to see all over the country towards Gaba Tepe & Achi Baba even the road along which their main supplies go is visible, camel trains one after the other can be seen at any hour of the day, also one of their HQs from which despatch riders are seen to come from every few minutes. All along the crest of Gaba Tepe dozens of troops can be seen, entrenching, & others out in the olive grove where their arty is secreted. A mail arrived today & I got 10 letters\n","190":"\n\nSunday 8 wks of go\n\nOut of the 10 letters I got 3 from Nell & 4 from home everything is great at home thank goodness, nothing much happened through the night just the usual rifle fire, we blew up last night at 10 & this led to a friendly exchange of lead, we were down at 701 again this afternoon & were just in time to see the French explode 7 mines & then converge all their arty on to the ridge to the L of Achi, it presented a beautiful sight especially at sundown (golden) over at the back of imbros, we watched a Turkish Bn move from Gaba to Achi & not a shot was fired at them, the beach on which we were supposed to land has 6 rows of barb out of the water & at least another 3 in the water this extends right under & past the fort, so I guess we would have struck rich. Got a letter from Norm his doing OK & Wags gives me latest news from \n","191":"\n\nMonday 37 wks from home\n\nThe Turks gave us a rather rude awakening this morning for they had all their guns including a new howitzer they had brought up through the night with this they were feeling for our 6\" how but no such luck, late last night they dropped a Jack J on to the depot but did no damage After lunch we went for the usual swim, after which we strolled up to the observation post & spent a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon first thing of note was 2 Regts of the enemys & no sooner had we sighted them than our howitzers opened fire with lyditte 2 shots fixed them up then they shelled the road for hours. The trawlers meanwhile were having a little game of their own out to sea, & after a while we saw a submarine under the water using her Deisel engines the exhausts threw a column of water 3 ft high & 100 feet long she was using both her Deisel & elect motors trying to get away as two trawlers had her in a net. Monitor accompanied by a aeroplane started to shell hill 701 with howitzers\n","192":"\n\nTuesday\n\nA very quiet night for once, a little rifle fire on the right after lunch we went for our usual swim & afterwards went up for a view from Hill 701 Nothing much to be seen only the Turks (2 guns) sent a few shells after one of the trawlers & destroyer, had tea, Turks sent 5 howitzers shells on to our positions from Courtneys to Hells & beyond knocking the parapets about only succeeded in injuring 2 men & then by burying them, we again went to 701 at 6 pm & watched our mountain baty shelling the road (lyditte & shrap) under the Gaba Tepe , an 18 pounder of ours helped the 6\" Hows to silence the Turks 5 (partially) the gunboat on our left was busy shelling our friends at sunset. Two howitzers were rendered fit for service under Capt Pace & were to be put in position tonight. Two aeroplanes were reconnoitering over the Turks for a considerable time this evening.\n","193":"\n\nWednesday 47 wks of soldiering\n\nThings very quiet during night only an occasional burst of rifle fire & bomb throwing. In the morning we paid a visit to & had a few shots at the loop holes, the Turks must have changed round for their men are very eager & daring & expose themselves but now they have lost a few they have calmed a little. Went down for our usual swim after lunch & found the water rather leady as a couple of guns in the olive grove were throwing it about a bit. Our howitzers got on to them after a bit & temporally silenced them. About 6 their 6\" started to shell with high explosives & after they had put in about a doz they turned it up & then the wounded started to appear, they got 10 altogether 2 seriously. A 11.2 gun shelled the M Gun Baty this morning but did no damage they appear to come from the direction of Maidos & is of a fat pattern. An effort is to be made tonight to draw the Turks fire at 9.15\n","194":"\n\nThursday\n\nThe ruse to draw their fire was every where successful about 2100 a firing of a mine was the opening of the ball then all troops gave three rounds of cheers but only two could be heard for the Turks fire was that heavy that nothing could be heard, dummys were then poked over the parapet & their fire got even heavier then died away about 2300 the same thing was repeated with the same success. A fine arty duel opened at sunrise & shell was busting everywhere, all our guns were speaking & with effect too Later the Monitor & destroyers lent a hand after an hour the Turks quietened a bit & then died away altogether. Paid a visit to Hill 701 at 1800 pm & saw a Turk battery in action at Gala & later engaged by our guns & silenced. 15000 men with 2000 more to follow landed down at Helles yesterday 265 bags of mail arrived this afternoon Played cards for an hour or two & then after yarning for an hour, turned in.\n","195":"\n\nFriday\n\nThe mail was NZ stuff. \n\nThe Turks made an attack on the right at 2100 pm but with no success they are more easily repulsed than ever, although their grenade work is really good Exceptional orders have been issued to them from Enver Pasha regarding their use of ammuns & care of shells everything points to the shortage we here so much of. Eric called this morning & told me of poor Pere’s death he died on the boat as a result to the wound in his stomach. Had our usual swim & then paid a visit to Hill 701 from where we could see the effect of the Monitors shelling from out in the Bay they were bursting at the Turkish HQs & making a bit of a mess later on she turned her attention to the 6\" howitzer that has been giving us so much trouble, meanwhile our Baty (Indian, 18 pds & How) were peppering the chess-board to some tune & playing havoc with their works.\n","196":"\n\nSaturday\n\nSeveral minor attacks during the night just enough to keep one awake, but at dawn the guns began to bomb from both sides & soon the damage was apparent on both sides the U trench opposite Popes came in for a special dose both from Howitzers & field pieces After lunch went down for the usual swim & later on the Lord Nelson accompanied by 18 destroyers & she started with 8\" 12\" guns to shell the rear of Achi Baba & the effect was heavy especially on the roads At 6 pm a light cruiser accompanied by an aeroplane commenced to shell the Turks at the back of Steels 6 gun broadsides were the order the aeroplane came in for a special amount of shelling & at one time 20 shells were visible in the air at once but none hit her after a while the Turks opened fire again with their heavy guns & gave Steels another gruelling. The Monitor came down later on 1915 and gave them some more at Fishermans Bend. Weather fine & hot\n","197":"\n\nSunday\n\nAll night the Turks kept us busy with bursts of rifle fire along the whole front but no Turks left the trench, the Turks at daybreak gave us more of shells & they shelled our whole front for 2 hours, nothing much doing through the day only a mail arrived & I got 4, 3 from home & 1 from Nell 9 pages (quois kitten) went down for a swim at 1300 & was in time to see cruiser open fire 1.6\" & 4.7\" guns on to a village E of our position she shelled it for an hour & the was observing from away out to sea the Turks returned the fire with light stuff & followed the cruiser for 15 minutes & after about 30 shots succeeded in landing one under the bridge but did no damage. The made a ruse at 2115 & when the Turks were in the trenches one of the warships imploded their trenches causing severe losses to the enemy, their return was only feeble after the shelling was over, showing that they suffered some. Expect a heavy attack at Achi tonight from the reports we are getting.\n","198":"\n\nMonday 38 wks from home\n\nAt daybreak this morning we started to shell the enemy’s trenches with all the guns we could bring to bear on him & he replied with field stuff & his heavy later on & gave Steels a severe bombardment pretty well destroyed Steels firing trench also inflicting severe losses to us, the long looked for bombardment of Achi started this morning & has gone on all day without a stop, an officer returning from there this morning informed me that we had taken a trench from flank to flank & hoped to get more tonight 2 French warships in the Narrows were supported their comrades while 6 of our own were shelling Achi with 12\" lyddite another big ruse tonight on our part accompanied by artillery fire. The 4.7 gun landed yesterday was today drawn up into position by 100 men. Firing looks to be one of the gunners, Ammunition arrives by the boatload. Innoculated again\n","199":"\n\nTuesday\n\nAt daybreak & all through the day the Turks kept up a heavy bombardment of Steeles & Courtneys about 1800 it reached its zenith & the wounded were coming out in dozens they got between 50 & 60 all told if they don’t shift this gun they will shift us & jolly soon too. Went for a swim after dinner & saw another battery of mountain guns (6) landed also met Irving is on the 4th Baty now, Reg Allen the Melbourne lad ran into me on the beach, great news from the South they are still advancing steadily & inflicting heavy losses on the Turks. Received a parcel from dear little Nell containing socks & safety pins. Russians have turned the tables on the Germans again & now they are penetrating fast over the river & into . Germans in W Africa have surrendered unconditionally to Botha along with 3000 men 200 officers 27 guns and 22 m guns. We got the timber at last for the bomb proof. The strength of the troop now is 21 all told, sickness is giving us hell, 3 men went yesterday & 2 more today. Swim again at 2030\n","200":"\n\nWednesday 48 wks of soldiering\n\nThe Turks through the night kept us busily engaged especially opposite Steels which front we abandoned through the night on account of their heavy howitzer fire, only a few observers being left there to give the warning in case of an attack, things were fairly quiet throughout the day Capt Richie was severely burnt by an 8\" it exploded a foot away & tore his clothing to ribbons. On the doc again for nothing much though Went down for our usual after tea, made inquiries for Eric who has disappeared but could find no trace of him, his gun was blown over the parapet & replaced this afternoon. Harold & I at 2000 started to build a bomb proof over the Signal office worked up till 2300 & succeeded in getting the frame ready for the iron which we intend putting tomorrow night Shells made their appearance on the beach during our swim much to annoyance who made the most of the time available to get under cover. Mountain guns were seen to go into their new position on the right.\n\n15 July 1915\n\nThursday 9 wks of Gallipoli \n\nThings very quiet through the night only a little rifle fire occasionally, great news came from the Cape where our forces are doing exceptionally well on both flanks & after swimming we visited 701. where a cruiser could be seen bombarding the rear of Achi & all her shots were accompanied with beautiful bursts, a Turkish battery at the foot of Achi was put out of action through the accuracy of her fire, later on she in turn shelled the road below Gaba Tepe where the enemy were to be seen bringing up large bodies of troops. All day a heavy bombardment of the enemys trenches has gone on down at the Cape & we expect it to fall any day now Aeroplanes are subjected now when they put in an appearance to a heavy shelling which points to demobilization, 2nd LH furnish the escort to the General this week over at Imbros so they ought to be in for a fairly good time The weather is still on the warm side at 1930 the Jack Johnson make their reappearance at Steeles post, more casualties. go on ab 20,00\n","201":"\n","202":"\n\nThe Turks made another attempt to give us a little more trouble last night but didn’t do much good only wasted a few shells but at daybreak they came for us properly with all their arty after an hours bombardment they took up the rifle & fired continuously for an hour not a shot did we reply they were to cunning to come out though so beyond giving us a little entertainment they did no damage. A full brigade of 5.2 howitzers landed last night 8 guns are to go on our left & 8 on our right this brings the total guns up to 72. Gen Hamilton paid us a visit in a racing motor launch today from Imbros Night before last the troops down at the Cape advanced 2100 yds in one place & in others took two sectional lines of trenches. The Monitor has been firing continuously all day at the rear of Achi & getting great bursts evidently the Turks are keeping their reserves there now as they are being continually faced back. More Jack Johnsons on Steels at 1800\n","203":"\n\nSaturday\n\nNothing of note during the night only several bursts of rifle fire accompanied by bombs & grenades. Capt Fiaschi has been attached to the 1st Regt as M.O. During the morning Cecil Oliver called & informed me that Eric Parki was killed whilst attending his gun both his mates were wounded by the same shell so that’s \"finish\" Parky’s. Went down for a swim which was just perfect & came home under a perfect hail of lead I don’t know how I missed it both sides were at it tooth & nail for 2 solid hours & at the Cape the guns were continuously on the roar. Another baty was landed last night the first one opened fire toady on the Chess board & did effective shooting, finished the bomb proof shelter last night & made a good job of it. Turks towards evening threw dozens of bombs at our structures at Quinns but without effect they then made a false attack but nothing was doing so they fell in. Aeroplanes have been over all day so Turks must be in force in places \n","204":"\n\nSunday 10 wks of fight (annotated 54)\n\nAwakened to the roar of a hundred guns at daybreak this went on for hours & then moved off down to the right, they gave both Steels & Courtneys particular hell with shrap & high explosive. Aeroplanes were fired on by an anti-aircraft gun the Turks have brought up but no damage was done They reported in turn that many reinforcements were being massed a mile back & then our howitzers took up the tune but no list of hits has come to hand. Went down for a dip at 1300 & was driven both in & out of the water with shrapnel 17 were hit around us, the burst was only 4 ft from us, we dived & when we came up it was all over. A mail arrived I got 3 from home but none from Nell so expect same in a day or two. Steels have been getting it hot with big stuff tonight & a company com was killed outright. Cooking a failure (dumplings)\n","205":"\n\nMonday 39 wks of soldiering\n\nAn attack was expected on our right last night for they after shelling out position for 2 hrs were massing in that direction. We fired star shell every fifteen minutes but nothing came of it. Went down for a dip after lunch & enjoyed it OK. Three warships were standing out 2 monitors & a cruiser. The latest monitor has 14\" guns & she with the others were shelling the road at the foot of 751 & one of our 18 batteries were also lending a hand with shrapnel Troops were moving along the road one could see by the dust & the guns must have done great damage. Our new howitzers are nearly ready for action as the emplacements are finished. A mail arrived & I got one from Keast & Wrig. Keast is in Heliopolis & Wrig is convalescent. Metch got one from Bert M who is going to England for a spell. Norm F & J. Duggan are being returned to Australia. Four aeroplanes made their appearance two on bomb throwing expeditions the other two reconnitoring\n","206":"\n\nTuesday\n\nThings got pretty brisk through the night & news came to hand that 100,000 Turks were marching down the Peninsular to engage us this being a final flutter on their behalf We being the weaker force expect to get it pretty hot & the attack is expected any moment accompanied by gases. Two new Caldwell machine guns were firing today & they’re some class. had our usual swim & then went over to the batteries first to the 6\" & then the 5\" both are well on the way to completion & should be firing in a day or two, the emplacements of the 5\" are tip top & will take some finding, ammunition is arriving by the boatload & 50 mules have been busy all day carrying same up to the guns the same applies to the batys on the left, two gun crews are at present on the 6\" one to stand by the other Two more planes over tonight accompanied by heaps of shell from all quarters but they only wasted more lead than did damage\n","207":"\n\nWednesday 49 wks of soldiering\n\nNothing of importance during night the long expected attack failed to come off but expect same tomorrow night for certain. Our howitzers throughout the day have been registering targets & made very good shooting at that. Things are fully brisk down the Cape as we within the last few days have been heavily reinforced & our arty has been booming for days.This 100,000 hasnt made their appearance yet & we dont want to be disappointed at the last moment. A mail arrived this morning & I got the long looked for from Nell, who is all of a quiver now that we are in action but there’s no need to worry for things will be OK to the end. Aeroplanes (4) have again been over our way & report that the enemy have cavalry & infantry on on L front at the back of the chessboard. The Turks got a bit figety at 1900 but our arty quickly quietened them. Had a visit from Cecil Oliver. Eric OK\n","208":"\n\nThursday\n\nThe Turks made a few feeble attacks during the night evidently feeling as to our strength & down the right it was a little heavier perhaps. Our howitzers made splendid practice during the night & probably they did much to subdue the Turks. Hal, Bert & I had a narrow squeak from a HE at the batteries possy a 4.5 from Silent Peter came along & burst at our feet but beyond bursting & smothering us in dirt no damage was done only we got burnt in digging for relics. The beach was shelled from all quarters today & so were our positions with both large & small stuff. Bert B & I went out tonight to hunt for caps got 2 & a live shell for the boys to play with. Hal went for a shoot had a little excitement at a Turk observing with a periscope at the Razor – Boss very crook. OK \n","209":"\n\nFriday\n\nThe long looked for attack didnt come back last night only at 12 they livened things up a little but only for a time though. Our 5\" howitzers were busy all night & had some bonza bursts. Had our usual today & then went up to 701 & watched two Monitors shelling the rear of Achi Baba one was confining her attention to the roads along which troops could be seen moving & the other to the Turks. at 3 this afternoon on the Northern end of our position at Helles the Turks made a rush at the trenches but although they employed plenty if bombs they only succeeded in getting near the trenches & wounding 2 officers & 28 men while we can count 50 of their dead outside the trenches. I met Cyril O who is OK down at the beach. Went out hunting for caps & were spotted by the Turks who promply gave us a fusillade but luckily no one hit. The Caldwell guns are doing great work at Steeles & their 1000 rds per run are sure to command attention from Turky\n","210":"\n\nSaturday\n\nOur guns kept up a hail of lead & high explosive on the Chessboard all night & this had gone on through out the day. The beggars are going to let us down after all & I think they have taken a tumble as to what awaits them over here. A mail arrived today but I only got one from Bert M who ought to be back any day now. The Turks have now French Mortars in use so that ought to even things up a trifle. Rumors afloat by the mile is troops are to land between here & Tepe also 1700 of Ks army to give us a hand here. CO & 2 operators to stand by for duty at Imbros on GHQ we resumed duty today at 12 & glad of the change. At sunset the Turks opened fire with all their guns on our positions the heavy howitzers did a good deal of damage to our earthworks although no men were hit. They got 16 men at the beach this morning with shrapnel & old silent Peter opened up again on the Howitzers who are OK\n","211":"\n\nSunday\n\nHowitzers busy all night but little or nothing to report only that a party of Turks (50) were caught out reconnatering and destroyed by machine gun fire. The enemy kept up a rain of shrapnel on the beach from both North and South they have brought guns around to the Southern end of the Salt Lake & now they can pitch a shell anywhere in Anzac The same thing applies from the other end. I went down for my usual at 1400 & then visited the Coy just in time to witness a few salvos of shrapnel One beauty demolished a huge stack of biscuits & blew off one mans arm. Ammunition is arriving by the million rounds & very heavy beach parties are needed for the next few days for unloading work. Turks have started to use the incendiary bombs on us but without success as they are easily extinguished. Howitzers got on to a party of Turks at drill & gave em beans. Mail dispatched today\n","212":"\n\nMonday 40 wks from home\n\nWe made a demonstration this morning at 8 am to try & draw the enemys fire but they are up to the dodge now & only fire as long as we do. The new brigade of arty is doing splendidly C baty has accounted for 4 guns at least whilst the other 3 btys have made havoc of gun emplacements etc of the Turks. On duty practically all day & went for a dip after tea, visited 701 & watched as pretty an artillery duel as one could wish to see between our guns on the right & the enemy’s at the foot of Gaba Tepe, then troops were observed moving along the road accompanied by cavalry & transport 6 guns (3 field 3 How) got on to them & made excellent practice their bursts being very effective , after dark they gave attention to the beach & threw over about 20 or 30 shrapnel then the gunboat engaged the enemy on the S of the Lake also shelling the gun now in position there Aeroplanes spotting effectively\n","213":"\n\nTuesday\n\nThe Turks have changed their garrisons again & tonight we are to try & draw their fire by a somewhat lengthy programme. The Turks have shelled the beach continuously all day & are doing a fair amount of damage. I went for usual swim at 1400 & combined QMS duties with it & drew all the stores needed from Ordance. The Turks are giving us a new bomb a huge un about 9\" in diameter & are hurled by a catapult gun which has an effective range of a mile. Trawlers very busy all the afternoon chasing a submarine but without success. Nothing doing down at the Cape, no movement of our troops visible at all. Press reports that we have taken the offensive again at last. as it is very evident that they dont intend to come at us again so we will have to go for em. The condensers made a start today & are filling the local reservoir first, then the drop reservoir further up the valleys. to be retained.\n","214":"\n\nWednesday 50 wks of soldiering\n\nThe ruse proved most successful they blazed away for two hours along our whole front & joined a little artillery in it as well, we gave them plenty of bombs. One of Gen Birdwood’s aide-de camps was killed this morning shot in three places with shrapnel whilst asleep outside his dugout he lingered for an hour, Eric P was down to see me this morning he’s OIT again a mail arrived & I got 5 but still no parcels. Finished the bomb proof under plenty of lead tonight but dodged 0ne. Harold not too good tonight. More guns to be landed tonight & taken round to the left flank, no more colonial ammo to be landed but any amount of MARIT VII & whips of artillery stuff, shells pretty thick all day & a Capt Armstrong killed at the beach. All sorts of rumors are afloat as to what and where we are going to when relieved shortly but India is the favorite at present. Incendiary bomb received at 1900\n","215":"\n\nThursday\n\nWe landed a battery of 60 pounders & 3 of 18 pdrs last night also with the necessary equipments, ammunition is arriving by the boat-load along with stores, Two german aeroplanes came over at 1800 one was driven off by two French & British planes, the other passed over our lines & again our planes chased him, he dropped a bomb on the Turks who again in their turn turned their anti-aircraft on him, after he had flown a couple of miles he was seen to cut out & then , he then capsized burst into flames & then disappeared over a small hill. The Turks gave our trenches hell from about 5 guns & all men had to be taken out of the trenches, but only for that the day had been very quiet along the whole front but down at the beach they are getting tons of shell they seem to have found out at last the real value of their guns & just how much damage they can inflict with them \n","216":"\n\nFriday annotated 56\n\nLast night the Turks blew up a mine in front of Quinns, although injuring no man in the firing line we suffered 9 killed & 7 wounded in the supports, by falling dirt Another Taube came along this morning & tantalized one of the destroyers but looping the loop for our benefit, then a Sopwith driven by Sampson came along & chased our friend off but he reappeared at 1600 & dropped two bombs on the beach but no damage was done. 2 4.7 landed last night & 3 more 18 pdr all to go on the R. News came to hand that we had achieved a victory in Persia taking the railway and now the road is open to Bagdad, we gave three cheers & fired 1 round as a Jeux-de-joix & The Turks didn’t seem to appreciate it. Wrote home & to Nell. Downing leaves tomorrow thank goodness, we have 28 men away ill & wounded. Got another batch of trophies by seeking after dark. Monitors shelling Chanak \n","217":"\n\nSaturday\n\nAll through the night a constant rifle fire was kept up by both sides but no attack was launched by either side. Downing left at 11 AM with the heads for Imbros Went for one usual at 1500 & paid a visit to 706 where quite an interesting sight was seen, the Navy was carving small bits of Achi & it was enveloped in smoke shells were bursting all along our front with great rapidity. The Taube came over again & let down a rain of in Canterbury gully but no one was hit. Turks give our positions a severe bombardment at sundown & our guns give them the same & the trenches are a picture to see especially the Chess board. Our 4.7 guns were firing tonight from their special emplacements & are doing splendid work although the Turks have been shelling their positions for hours, but with little or no gain\n","218":"\n","219":"\n\nThe Turks by doing a little mining on our right not only threatened our works but made enfilading possible by their guns so the 5th Brig & the 5 LH were ordered to go out at 1AM & take the first trench this they did & at the same time inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, they then stormed & took the second trench, this time no resistance was offered, not a Turk showing fight, as the trench could be commanded from the first so we were ordered to retire on the first trench, 60 Turks were counted in & about their trenches our losses were 10 killed & 74 W not too bad considering the nature of the job After lunch we went for our usual then paid a visit to 701 where a fine view was had of a severe bombardment of Achi Baba from all positions, the hills were smothered in dust & our guns were peppering Gaba with shot of all sizes & shapes. Dobbyns sent away with Influenza to Maidos for a couple days \n\n2 August 1915\n\nMonday 41 wks from home\n\nDuring the night the Turks launched a heavy counter attack but nothing came of it & our returns were of the liveliest nature although we were content with consolidation only & not of offence, this must have annoyed them for they didn’t venture out of the trenches. We witnessed a great fight between a Taube & a British plane they manoeuvered for a position over the other for an hour & all the while they were chucking shots at one another the Monitor settled it by bringing into use her anti- aircraft gun she only fired two shots when the Taube thought better of the encounter & sailed away over her own lines. No water, barge either missing or sunk so things are again crook. A Brig & his staff landed today they belong to the 29th Brig, & also 3 Bn of Gurkas who have gone along to the left flank. Admitted into hospital with gastro arthritis but nothing of much consequence. \n","220":"\n\nTuesday\n\nHal called & saw how things are going, I passed a fairly good night temp 102. In the morning a Turkish aeroplane dropped a bomb which fell almost 20 yds from the hospital but luckily no one was hit during the night we landed about 1700 toops of the first Kitcheners army mainly the Glosters & the Worchesters they arrived from Lemnos, they seem a good sturdy crowd & ought to give an excellent account of themselves, All day long a terrific cannonade was going on down at the Cape & was carried up to her by our own guns this evening & the rifles took on the tale later on in the evening. Gen Cheaval & Chas Cox came back today. Plenty of \"footys\" came over at 6 but nothing of any importance to either side. The Monitor has been shelling the road very heavily for 2 hours & is supported by our Howitzers later the Talbot put a salvo or two into Silent Peter\n","221":"\n\nWednesday 51 wks of soldiering 13 wks of Gallipoli\n\nMore troops arrived during the night & have filled in every available gully in Anzac they shelled the gully heavily this morning & one chap was shot in hospital, thousands of shells landed & still landing. The Taube came over again & dropped more bombs but again they did no damage our planes give them a dose of the same medicine & with better effect too. Artillery has been constant all throughout the day & ours is playing hell with their trenches although their guns are not doing ours much good. I think they have got the dirty end of the stick, rifle fire is still pretty brisk & snipers are fairly active again, We expect a bit of a counter by the Turks tonight although don’t expect it to be of any weight if it is they will get all & more than they want \n","222":"\n\nThursday \n\nStill more troops landed & equipment & space is pretty limited now & water is none too plentiful. A heavy engagement was going on all day at the Cape & our arty has been pretty continuous here all day, preparations are going ahead rapidly for the dust up tomorrow night troops are to carry nothing but ammunition & huge white patches are shown on the backs of the tunics & on both arms. The Tommys carry a metal disc this is to enable our artillery to pick out our troops & fire accordingly everything points to a big affair this time & is anxiously awaited for by everyone ; expect to be out of hospital tomorrow. Mick sent away with sciatica, Hobbs called & so did Fred & gave me all the news. The Monitors have been keeping the reserves of the enemy busy with their accurate shooting & the road itself is ruined\n","223":"\n\nFriday AM 1.18 \n\nThe Turks had a go at those two trenches we took off them a few days ago they put up a good fight but got the worst of it.

The Ausn Divn attacks at 5 pm & then the German trench we are to support it with all possible aid then at 8 our posts join in & go for en on the left they carry on an advance of their own. Our howitzers have been carving their trenches about all day the bombardment proper starts at 1700 aided by the navy destroyers have been patrolling all day & a few big ships are now present here. Turks shelled Canty this morning & with one shell they got 2 killed & 14 wounded. Tauber drops more bombs & arrows but only two men were hit. Three planes have been reconnitering all day.\n","224":"\n\nSaturday Battle of Anafarta \n\nThe bombardment last night was terrific & the explosions rent the air all night long at 8 pm the Ausn Divn had progressed well on to the objective the Lonesome Pine 9-5 they had got there & are now still holding it we went out as ordered with 400 men & did nothing instead the first Regt were cut to pieces & the second are just as bad, on Walkers ridge they are held up just the same, but on the Left again with the 2 divn that landed at Anafarta they have advanced 4 mile by 6 pm. Battleship hill is ours 2 guns have been captured 6 machine guns, 2 nordenfeldts, all of which are now being used on the enemy.

Scores of boats lay off the new landing & the navy is assisting the troops\n","225":"\n\nSunday\n\nBusiness was brisk through the night as the Turks counter attacked severly but beyond filling in between the trenches with their dead. On the Left our success is further prolonged & 971 is completely ours. Prisoners are still arriving & two of their own accord. We have advanced as far as Asma Dere, Chunak Dere, and the Tommy’s are doing even better further on the Left. Two of our submarines sunk between them 2 warships & a transport & then they rose & bombarded a Turkish column, not only did they inflict awful casualties but they succeeded in holding up the column for a couple of hours. We resume the attack again at 5 am tomorrow morning & to keep as many engage as possible for the troops go forward again in the morning. The gunnery has been terrific all day & the Navy has been of great assistance to us our howitzers have done splendidly all through especially on the Chess Board where the Turks could be seen being mowed down.\n","226":"\n\nMonday 42 wks from home\n\nGen Cox attacked this morning & almost succeeded but was stopped by hostile counter-attack. In consequence of this Gen Baldwin was unable to advance far & is now consolidating on the line farm .

Battle raged all day long on the whole front with undiminished energy on either side. Though we are getting it pretty hot the Turks are getting it even hotter, another 200 prisoners taken yesterday every one of them have been sent away. They shelled the beach for hours this morn but we had our swim. Met Les Bonning wounded from a bomb. Three of our planes did a little bomb dropping for practise at 1800 tonight & evidently did well judging by the fire the Turks directed at them. Achi Baba is being vigorously attacked by our forces\n","227":"\n\nTuesday\n\nPlenty of fighting still knocking about & on the Left we got more than we asked for & had to retire from Chainuk Bair at 4 this morning. We counter attacked & regained it then they took it again & this has been going on all day. Our artillery early in the morning cut their forces to ribbons the observers say that they must have accounted for fully 50% of them, they were holding this Chanuk Bair & were in force all over the hill, viz the damage done by the artillery. The navy has been \"buying in\" all day with their guns & one has been firing on the Chess board over our heads all day. Mail day today & I got four letters & parcels & 2 papers so didnt do to badly but none from Ern. Witnessed a great go in between one of our planes & 2 of the enemy’s. first ours charged theirs & drove it off over the enemy’s lines & she followed, but when a couple of miles over an Albatross drove her home so we dont know who got the best of it. Things indicate an interesting night\n","228":"\n\nWednesday 52 wks of soldiering\n\nWe had a pretty tough night of it & the Cheshires had to give up a trench they made it that hot for them, but I dont think we will come back any further. Only for a arty duel the day has been very quiet The cruisers bombarded the hill the whole day through & our guns have done more than their share, they reckon that the Turks losses exceed five times our numbers. Our troops down at the Cape have been awake lately & its said that they took 700 prisoners within the last few days & the French are progressing top hole. Aeroplanes have been chasing round all day and at 6 tonight there were four of ours when one of the Deutcher’s appeared & they all after him but he got away safely.

New ballon ship working in accordance with Anafarta \n","229":"\n\nThursday Wrote home & Nell\n\nHeavy Turkish attack was delivered about 0530 this morning mainly against Rhododenda Spire, Chunak Bair & down the slopes E of farm. Turks massed in great numbers under the Bair & suffered awful losses coming over ridge as they were exposed to field & naval gun fire who made the most of their opportunities. They succeeded in taking trenches on the Bair but had to clear out later on account of arty & cross fire from No. 3 Section, the attack died down at 1100. Our left has been thrown forward by the South Wales Borderers to Naylor Chair. No. 6 section had also extended on the left, an 100 men was sent out last night to strengthen the L flank inner defence No. 5 section extending it from Bauchops Hill to the sea. Sniping on the beach has been pretty bad all day & at times they brought a machine gun to bear. Two Zepps & nine planes reported in Constantinople. Our planes have had two goes with the enemy & have driven him off on each occasion. They shelled our ships today\n\n13 August 1915\n\nFriday\n\nAlthough despite plenty of fire through the night the situation remains unchanged. Sniping is on the increase.

The Navy has been strengthened at Anafarta & has been bombarding 971 for all they are worth Looked up Bobs grave & think that I’ve found it at the Mohammedon Cemetry. The Turks bombarded our trenches heavily at 1900 and we returned the compliment only on a larger scale, they were bringing up heavy reinforcements when our artillery got on to them & inflicted terrible damage. We expect them to attack tonight after all their shelling & also on the L. Aeroplanes are constantly appearing in numbers now of an evening, last night 4 & then 3 more tonight. Monitors busy all day till night\n","232":"\n\nSunday\n\nBoth on the Right & Left we were attacked by the Turks about 1.30.

Beachy Bill was very active during the night & all day through. Our troops on the left again took that house but were unable to hold it on account of the severe counter attack by the enemy. Ammunition is again arriving by the boatload & guns also which are to go to the Left. At 1400 a series of mines were exploded opposite Quinns with the maximum amount of damage. After tea the enemy let go a few Jack J into Steeles & Courtneys but they were not as effective as usual, although their \"75\" was bursting well.

A mail arrived but still no letters for me, or parcels. Down at Helles things are practically at a standstill only a few heavy artillery duels takes place now & then, but no infantry action whatever, so it has about fizzled-out there as far as offensive operations are concerned. Our warships through the course of the day sighted a whale & mistaking it for a submarine cut it to pieces with gun fire.

Bursts of fire took place at Kaiajik Aghala about 2300 & 0200 latter accompanied by bombs. Heavy firing heard beyond our extreme left direction Hills about 1430 today. Situation quiet over all other parts of the line. A number of Turks approached the L flank defences at Kaiajik shouting & with both hands held over their heads, as it was thought they wished to surrender they were allowed to approach the line held by 14th Sikhs. Some salaamed & shook hands, it was then noticed that they had their rifles & attempts to take them were resisted a scuffle ensued & 2 Sikhs were shot. They then opened fire & the Turks who were not killed fled. They nearly all had bombs attached to their waistbelts, they evidently intended to bomb & then rush the trenches. Gen Cox is to again hold line from Susak Kuyu & Kazlar Chair with piquets tonight. Mail arrived but only received 3 none from Nell. Artillery blew out 8 m guns.\n\n24 August 1915\n\nTuesday\n\nThings were quite normal in our section only occasional bursts of bombing & rifle fire the situation on the Left is slightly changed & the 10th Gurchas hold extreme left of line to within 15 yds of Susak Kuyu well, which will be included as soon as sandbags are obtainable. Westward of this a practically continuous entrenchment runs about 70 yds S of the Kavakler Rd joining the R of ninth corps at Crossroads 200 west of Havakler. This line is now held as under on extreme right two companies 19th Aust inf thence about 200 Northumberland Fusiliers remainder of line up to Cross roads held by 70 South Staffords & some details 9th corps. Indian Bde have improved across plain & communication from rear. Gen Russells position at Kaiajik Aghala now strengthened. Great news of a decisive naval victory to the Russians in the Baltic came to hand at 1800, one super-dreadnought (Molke) 3 cruisers & 7 TPD being sunk. They tried to effect a landing but the whole concern was captured. Italy has declared war on Turkey & Greece is about ready.\n\n25 August 1915\n\nWednesday 54 wks of soldiering\n\nDuring last night & today things have been quiet along the fronts of No 3+4 Sections; a strong patrol of Cheshires worked down to farm last night & returned without casualties. a new front on Rhodendron spur was completed, the Northumberland F have entrenched between Chair & our left picket of the 14 th Br our 11th Div line now runs from cross roads 92a between 2 & 5 West of Kavalier thence to Australian Post The enemys arty opened fire at 10AM on our infantry near Q, they were engaged by the 2nd Bty effectively after firing 15 rds. The ninth corps reported 6 red objects like big cylinders visible from Lala Baba in Turks trenches 92.0.2.","236":" Bty (1 tners) opened fire with 16 rds and finished em.

Went down to the Beach this morning & nearly \"caught\" a piece of lead visited Henderson who supplied us with 4 tins of Milk. Late in the afternoon they shelled our bivouac for hours with Silent Peter, pieces flying everywhere, the Turks employed a new bomb on a long stick & fired on the rocket principle it makes a decent row coming down & gives very good warning of its approach. The","239":" Bn have taken over Russells Top & we made a combined attack at 2000 oclock with excellent results. A 22 bag mail arrived today but again none for me from Nell or home which will have to be seen into The bombardment of the Straits is still being carried on & at times assumes a fierce artillery combat Holland went back to the Cape leaving here the Navy from Suvla Bay having being shelling the Turks off & on all day & in some cases brought enfilade fire to bear on them.\n","240":"\n","241":"\n\nAnother comparatively quiet night & in the morning the artillery was banging away at each other, but at 4.30 the arty started a bombardment of Knoll 60 Navy assisting Gen Cox made the first report at 11.50 as follows. By 2200 we appeared to make some headway towards knoll 60, especially in centre but have not reached top as the Turks were not driven out by bombardment & consequently the resistance is strong, a later message states that Austns are on with NZrs not far short of knoll the Connaughts are working trench D to C. Col Pope who can see well from his position reports he has gained two trenches & are not far from objective , a little later he reported that we held 9\/10ths of hill & that at midnight with fresh troops endeavour to capture remaining tenth The Connaught’s are now in possession of the whole of their piece after desperate hard fighting. The NZ’s Bde have still to get a bit to the W. The Aust on the R through B trench have still a little to get. Gen Russell captured a machine gun & is using it against Turks. \n","242":"\n\nSaturday\n\nWe accomplished our objective although the Connaughts after capturing their positions couldnt hold them & they retired then the ninth LH were sent to do the job which they did with 175 men after suffering 100 casualties, the whole of the new line have been consolidating throughout the day. Artillery fire has been pretty prevalent throughout the day & later on in the day, about 6 rounds were fired into No 2 Section. Monitors shelled Chunuk Bair for some time with 14\" guns & secondary armament. Aeroplanes both ours out on reconnaissance on same section only ours drives enemy off after little manoeuvring. Went for a dip as usual & called in to see Ted H who was OK stores arriving by the boatload. No sign of our reliefs as yet they got mixed up in the fight & probably that may detain them. Our Howitzers are to fire on Turks as soon as they open up with the 75 mm both on R & the Left. News of one of our submarines torpedoing 4 large Turkish transports in the straights above Nagara was received today. The Turks were reinforcing their trenches on Hill 60 & our artillery is giving em heaps\n","243":"\n\nSunday annotated 59\n\nThings were quiet on our front during the night but on the Left there was further action on Kaiajit Aghala position to gain more trenches & consolidate ground already won was carried out at 0100 hours by Gen Russell. The 10th LH regt successfully took the enemy’s trench held it & are now consolidating position round top of Knoll 60 & back to point held yesterday morning in continuous line, up to 0300 no sign of counter attack. Complete communication established across Haijik Dere between 4th Ausn Inf Bde & New Zealanders on Kaiajit Aghala where bombs are still being exchanged. The outlook on the Left is very promising & it is said that portion of the main railway to Maidos can be seen. On the R the Turks are trying our old game instantaneous bombs but no luck. Had usual dip this morning much colder. Visited Ted H at 1800 & nearly met it from two of Brady Bills dirt flung up all round us & a man who was shoving me up the hill got it in the head killed instantly, mail arriving 19 bags\n","244":"\n\nMet Nell again this day 1914\n","245":" 45 wks from home\n\nThe enemy threw a few flares opposite Quinns during the night & at 10.15 pm we fired a mine for them to serve out amongst themselves, we drew heavy fire from the Turks & the Ausn Divn at Courtneys put another 3 into them. In no 6 section consolidation was carried a step further & more machine guns & trench mortars have been put in position, bombing is fairly prevalent. Our artillery has been busy throughout last night & today, firing on troops on the flat country to the L & the 5 Bty by High 6x demolished as observation station at Abdel Rahman Bair. The mountain Ctgs were firing on troops on road opposite their front all day & also destroyed a gun emplacement on which the Turks have been busy during the last few days. The ninth corps reports everything is quiet on their front. We have been subjected to a severe bombardment of 4.2 guns (1 bty) & they have blown our stores about some. Another mail arrived & I at last received one from Nell. Fritz has been dropping bombs off & on at the Right but all fall into water doing no damage. The Turks have a faulty bomb & are instructed to take care, we hear explosions regularly perhaps that’s the cause\n","246":"\n\nTuesday annotated 60\n\nA very quiet night was spent on our front last night opposite Quinns the enemy tried a little digging & threw some flares, at 5 pm the gun (enemy) in mule gully opened fire but very little damage was done. Opposite No 2 post a party of Turks appeared evidently to repair damage done by our artillery on their parapets, but they were quickly dispersed by our machine guns. At 10 am this morning we shelled Chailer Dere for hours to make up for the grilling they gave us last night. A new com trench has been dug between Kaiajit Aghala position & Indian Bde N which will shorten the line & give a better field of fire. Works have also been improved in rear of Indian Bde. At Kaiajit Aghala there was considerable rifle fire & bomb throwing but progress was made in improving the trenches & clearing up. Our artillery was fairly active throughout the day putting one gun out of action at 1 pm by 5 direct hits. The M boys were registering & shelling trenches in turn on . Felt pretty crook all day but better towards night fall\n","247":"\n\nWednesday 55 wks of soldiering\n\nAfter a very quiet night along our front, we had an exhibition of a Turkish ruse on a large scale along our R & Left, they drew little or no fire from us only enough to keep them going. They threw a few flares at Quinns but that is all. The movement of troops has begun the 17th are now in Auckland gully & the 1st Regt leaves tomorrow for our new rendevous where I believe the trenches are 350 yds apart so our chaps will get a spell from bombing which they have rightly earned. Gunnery has been fairly severe both here & lower down during the day on both sides. Ordance has several 100 rds of German 75 ammunition & 3 lb anti-aircraft stuff, also the barrell of the gun in No 5 battery in which a shell burst, busting it from end to end & separating it far enough to allow a hand to be put in quite comfortably. A Taube came over today & dropped two bombs at Suvla Bay & not a shot was fired at him they have made a practice of this lately our machines have been confined to spotting for the navy during the last few days. Prepared mail for home.\n","248":"\n\nThursday\n\nA quiet night along the whole front they tried another ruse but it wouldnt work. HMS Grafton reported by wireless that the Russians were offering a magnificent resistance near Freiderstadt the German attempt to cross Drina was repulsed off Vina & , the Austro-Germans suffered serious check in Galiva on Line many fierce attacks all repulsed enemy oblidged to retreat. Russians successful counter attacks resulting in capture of 30 guns 24 machine guns & 3000 prisoners. Russian recent victory in Caucasus vast booty 5000 prisoners pursuing Cossacks killed over 2000. Italians steadily pressing on. Artillery of allies busy in Flanders & the Turks are said to be preparing a general attack on all fronts, hope its true for I can see another armistice. Another of our merchant ships was torpedoed at 10 am this morning 10 mls off Helles. Artillery pretty busy on all fronts & the Monitors have been giving Rhodendron a bit of hurry up. A few shells made their appearance whilst I was having my usual old Silent Peter again. Moved over to new position at 1850\n","249":"\n\nFriday\n\nSpent a very quiet night but on the Left things were very brisk as the Turks were getting a bit jumpy. We moved out at 2 pm for our new home with full kit & after a severe 4 ml march we eventually arrived to find our area very hilly just 2 ml this side of Sulva Bay our positions are as follows Destroyer Hill Benels Hump No 1 & 2 outposts these posts are only held by one squadron each so our chaps are in for a fairly easy time. Got fairly settled about seven then line between here was down so Smith & I went out on it over very rough country & any amount of danger. We found the break immediately under Snipers Rest one of the enemy had sneaked out & cut it debibualy with a bayonet so I can see heaps of work for the linesman. We get a splendid view from our hill right over Sulva across the flats where the infantry got such a grilling from the advance from Sulva. The crowd that takes over in No 3 are having a rotten time for they know F A of the job.\n","250":"\n\nSaturday\n\nSpent a very tired night for yesterday was rather strenuous for one not being used to it after such a long break of non marching. At dawn they (the enemy) filled our gully with shrapnel but luckily no one was hit although some were pretty close. Harold & I made a tour of the Turkish trenches which we found to be perfect, they evidently have studied trench comforts for some of the bomb proofs are palaces compared to ours, their dead are lying all around our new position & fatigue parties are on the job they must have got it fairly hot for the hills are full of dead & right rosy they smell at times especially when the winds blow in the right direction. Went down for our usual dip & enjoyed it immensely although snipers busily keeping the water warm. Stores have to be drawn at NZLH Div Supplies & brought up on mules Wally Moore put in an appearance at 6 & gave us all necessary information re the doings of the boys for the last 14 days going back tomorrow Mail expected\n","251":"\n","252":"\n\nThings were exceptionally quiet here during the night but the Ausn Divn had a very successful ruse & drew a huge volume of fire nevertheless it brought nothing on our front but the ninth army corps benefited slightly by the activity on the Right. The 22nd & 23rd Bn landed early this morning so I made a trip to Anzac both for stores & to look up Eric, I found him, K Looker &young Hodges in Canty Rest Gully ok, beachy Bill has got em bluffed & consequently troubles their fatigue parties Had tea with Teddy & set out for home at 1900arrived in time to go on duty at 2000. Intend making a further trip to see Eric tomorrow A 12 bag mail is due tonight so letters shortly The enemy have been shelling our batteries in the flat all day & making rather good practice, Hal & I had our usual dip & got sniped all across blackberry flat but luckily his want of skill with the rifle saved us Sea is beautiful here after Anzac\n\n6 September 1915\n\nMonday 46 wks from home\n\nSpent another quiet night along the whole front only a little fire occasionally. A monitor shelled 971 with her 4\" guns then later the gunboats gave Walkers Ridge a dose. Went round to pay Eric another visit but found that he had moved off with his Bn to Browns Dip & relieved the R I Rifles who are now in Rest. Gully. The enemy shelled us & the lines of transport all day with every shell & make at their disposal but they only succeeded in getting 4 mules, even the bathing parties got a share of it. Gun outpost came in contact with 12 men under a sergt last night in front of our lines they had been sent out to get a sniper but the sniper has got 5 of them instead. Mail came in last night we expect to see it tomorrow. Everyone busily employed in making winter quarters for themselves at present Sig office & Bde office nearly finished. Two more piers are being built opp the Sphinx & a huge store is being made inland probably as a base for the winter\n","253":"\n\nTuesday\n\nSave for a miniature attack on Camel Hump later last night things were only quiet, away on the left the ninth army corps had a successful demonstration. The Turks at daybreak gave us the usual shelling & the 60 pounders got hell for an hour or so, Indian transports also came in for a grilling & several men were hit, later when Bill & I went for water one showered us & one penetrated his shirt. Fritz was over in a brand new machine & had a shot or two with his bombs but nothing doing. Our new home is looking something like an encampment. Ships at Suvla keep us supplied with bursting shells. Remodelled the lines of C both tele & Cable & saved a few hundred ft of wire. Fatigue parties still burying the enemy’s dead. Both & Jack are wounded , J Ellesley is killed. Our 60 pounders have been pumping in shell for all they are worth & as they kick up a cloud of dust at every shot they attract plenty of whistlers from Turkey Canteen Stores arrive\n","254":"\n\nWednesday 56 wks of soldiering\n\nThe Australian Divisions took up the offensive at 2000 & succeeded in gaining ground off Brown’s Dip, the Turks with a severe counter in which they lost heavily got it back, the losses must have been 2 to 1 in favor of us, Fritz & his brother have been over paying us a visit regularly lately but he needs heaps of practice in bomb dropping for his shots were falling in the Turks lines as often as in ours the Russians are reported to be making a stand at last but they must have got the worst of it in the last three wks of fighting, Gen Joffe paid a visit to the Italian Frontier & found everything satisfactory Our submarines have been active again in the Sea of Marmara sinking more transports & another destroyer The 2nd in command of 215 swam ashore &undertook to blow up a bridge single handed he only partially succeeded after running the gauntlet & having to swim for it at the last. Throat getting sore again I’m afraid off duty for tonight \n","255":"\n\nThursday\n\nHad rather a bad night & throat a little worse but that didn’t stop Hal & I making 3 good meals off the canteen stores, paid a visit to Anzac in the afternoon & things are very busy there, especially in the ammunition line, this points to a further engagement shortly, they are establishing our Winter base under the Sphinx & with Railways out to the piers the stuff is just pouring in & will have to to for the gales are expected to start any day now. The Turks have been giving us hell with their artillery lately & they have kept the ball rolling today especially in the region of the Sap where the Indians have been in a habit of taking the mules outside instead of in & consequently have fallen in over it, the 7th Brigade are expected to land tonight & to come up tomorrow they relieve the men who are going to for a fortnight’s spell then they in their turn relieve others until everyone has had his turn. Wally Moore paid us another visit \n","256":"\n\nFriday \n\nThroat a little worse so I paid a visit to the doc who had no hesitation in giving me 3 pills & a couple of drops of condey’s to serve as a gargle, at about 430 the Turks opened up a severe cannonade on our Left center trenches they cut them to bits with their shell but as our men were withdrawn when it started our casualties were slight after the gunnery had quietened & our troops had occupied the trenches again the enemy came out expecting to find the trenches full of dead instead they were full of lead as they soon found out to their cost as our machine gun & rifle fire was deadly & they quickly got back into their trenches, as there was an issue of fresh meat today Harold prepared a royal feast for tea, grilled chops, fritters fish, custard & toast well I got the lot down to throw it all up again During the day several Taubes proved annoying, one was connected with the Turkish attack the other just in patrolling up & down the trenches dropping her supply of bombs, returning for more, & coming back to give em to us, this went on for hours.\n","257":"\n\nSaturday Left for Imbros ill\n\nSpent a bad night, temperature rising & throat no easier, called at the Doctors again & he said that I was getting along ok I don’t think so & large mail came in this morning & I got 8 Letters and several papers but none from Nell Harold also received his chocolate. The 3rd LH are to fund the detachment of 1 officer LH other ranks to assault & take what is known as Snipers Rest this post is about 200 yds in advance to Camels Hump & the Turks are giving heaps of trouble for there with their accurate rifle fire & machine gun fire they not only command the flat’s breadth Sari Bair but the whole beach is under their gaze & men are being continually sniped, the range is longer but for all that they hit hard. The Turks have kept up their artillery bombardment off & on all day & the heavy batteries have come in for more than their share but after a while all guns were at it again thus showing that their fire was as usual. Burrel & Power sent away today for treatment, I expect to go tomorrow as I’m feeling off to blazes\n","258":"\n\nSunday\n\nHad another bad night & have broken out in a severe rash which the the doctor had no hesitation as diagnosing as Fever so I was sent away first to L.H.F.A.H thence by trawler to Imbros where I arrived at 8.30 & where I am to remain for several days prior to my departure to Alexandria, The trip over was glorious although another chap & I were isolated in a boat with only a pig for company, we paid a visit first to the Hospital Ship picked up the trawler there & set out for Imbros, passing on the way Monitors, destroyers & submarines going out on patrol work, a boom has been thrown across the harbour & entrance can only be made at one particular spot inside were all sorts & sizes of ships, Monitors of the two 14\" gun turret class cruisers with their on, Admiral boats & several French cruisers, alongside the quay a submarine was giving her engines a preliminary run both Diesel & Elect motors. Thousands of Gippo’s are employed carrying stones down off a mountain & throwing them into the water alongside submerged boats\n\n13 September 1915\n\nMonday 47 wks from home\n\nSpent a fair night & awakened to find myself under the care of R.A.M.C. Leads am living all on milk, temperature up to 102 still, later on in the day two more chaps were put in my tent with the same complaint one is a New Zealander the other from Dublin, belonging to the Fusiliers. This island is very much like the country around Geelong & the birds are nearly all found in Victoria, any amount of water fruit etc. Just above the boom they have established an aerodrome both for planes & airships, one airship they were trying yesterday she is of a cigar shape, of aluminium color & has a suspended carriage in which there is room for 2 persons, engines bombs etc, she is tractor principal & the rudder & similar to a submarine by the way she was manoevering yesterday they are very easily handled for she despite her length was dodging in & out of the naval boats, Aeroplanes annoy you all day for they tune just where we are & also practice bomb dropping & we got the benefit of this. Men arriving & departing all day & we expect to be off in a few days time to Alex.\n\n14 September 1915\n\nTuesday\n\nHad another bad night the rash is very troublesome & left me awake all night temperature is down to 101 am just beginning to peel & throat is still very sore. Things are normal in the harbour a little movement amongst the navy perhaps but that’s all, owing to the roughness of the weather & its now raining in torrents The aviators have also been quiet but as the weather out to sea shows signs of breaking we are hopeful of an early reappearance. The Arabs have been blasting the different hills round about for the stone with which it is intended to complete the breakwater now under construction The same old melancholy chant goes on as what used to exist in Cairo little work & plenty of row. We heard a rumor said to come from General HQ that the Turks owing to a shortness in ammunition had asked Germany to hurry up the supplies or otherwise she (Turkey) would be compelled to seek a separate treaty with the allies. Hamilton has his HQ just in rear of our lines & moves to & fro from the bay via a motor a real beaut.\n\n15 September 1915\n\nWednesday 57 wks of soldiering\n\nStill another rotten night the rash is giving me hell & I feel as if I could tear the clothes off me. The airships & planes on account of the day breaking fine were out & about & dodging this way & this, the French have added two planes to their fleet which now consists of 8, 3 mono & 5 biplanes. No movement in the harbor at all, only one Hospital Ship arrived, loaded, & sailed again. I thought it was a trip for us but no such luck as yet. The navy commenced a new slipway for submarines today & two divers have been fitting the pounds at 20 fathoms they are to be made in such a way so as to enable the ships to be brought up into dry docks or the repairing sheds which are also in the course of construction. Blasting has been going on in the hills all day long & the nigs have an ample supply of stone to keep them going. We got a fairly liberal supply of fruit grapes for a change & they went down lively after being without for such a while. Another Hospital Ship has arrived & I believe about 700 from here are to board her tomorrow.\n\n16 September 1915\n\nThursday\n\nSpent another restless night & was awakened by a terrific cannonade from the Navy & found out later that two Taubes were hovering over Gen Head Quarters & later they started to bomb, they had three effective shots but only injured several men our planes went up but were quickly driven down by machine gun fire, our shells were bursting all round & succeeded in driving them off without loss. Later in the day our planes, airships etc came to light. About 4.30 in the afternoon we got the word to pack up for the Hospital Ship which we did arriving there about 5 we were then put into our cabins on the stern of the vessel, we were then informed we were off to Mudros to join the Aquatania reship on her & go home for a trip if its true I can see a goodbye to Gallip for me for a while. This is a 12000 tonner named the \"Dunluce Castle\" rather a superior type of vessel & makes an excellent hospital ship. The weather has come up very rough again & we expect a dirty night.\n\n17 September 1915\n\nFriday Sailed today\n\nSpent another bad night the rash has assumed an irritable itch that not only annoy me but prevents all hope of sleep despite the tablets given by the doctor. More rain set in during night accompanied by heavy gales & the sea is running a treat & consequently has interfered with the transport of the sick & wounded from over the Peninsular. The naval vessels look fine ploughing through it with the waves sweeping them from stem to stern more especially the monitors. One of our trawlers was hit & sunk by a shell at Sulva two men were injured & the boat sank in 15 minutes. My temperature was down to 97 in the morning but up again to 98 at night We had a welcome change in diet for lunch rice & jelly & tea for tea so we are not doing to badly. Our departure is put off until tomorrow on account of this rough weather & we then sail direct to Lemnos & connect up with the Aquatania, started to feel today\n\n18 September 1915\n\nSaturday Arrived Lemnos\n\nNo sleep again last night on account of the itch, the doctor thought that perhaps a little refreshment might do us good & at tea we were ordered bread & butter. We up anchored at 6 at last & proceeded to Mudros arriving there at 11 to find the harbour very conjested with shipping. The airship followed us for a long way & the way she can be handled is a treat, on our way up the harbour 8 hospital ships were passed the Aquatania sailed this morning for England with fever cases on board. Mudros the chief town of Lemnos is a few brick shanties with a rather superior type of church in it & the sole living of the populace is fishing & rural work. A few windmills adorn the ridges round a place they call Turks Head but nothing more breaks the view over dry & desolute hills that resemble very much the arid hills of Asia in the Red Sea. The French have a fairly large garrison in this place\n\n19 September 1915\n\nSunday Went ashore\n\nSpent a real good night at last & temperature was down to normal, at daybreak we moved further up the harbor passing on our way dozens of ships of the mercantile fleet, many French warships & heaps of ours also we took up our anchorage off the Mudros pier, stationary hospitals are on all the hills round the island in fact its practically a sick island the French also have their hospital here. Turkish prisoners are making roads by the mile under Sengalese guards. at 2 pm we were told that we had to go ashore to hospital & 10 minutes afterwards we were lowered in stretchers over the side into a naval picquet boat then landed at the quay to be picked up by a motor ambulance & conveyed to No 1 Gen Hospital & dumped in the hospital. The Swiftsure left during the harbour & she was no sooner out of the harbor than a submarine had two goes at her but both luckily missed she then went up to the Cape & its rumored they are going to force the Straits. doubt it.\n\n20 September 1915\n\nMonday 48 wks from home\n\nSpent rather a good night & the doctor who visited us early in the morning put me on to ordinary diet & now I ought to put on weight. All day the harbor has been very busy ships coming & going every hour, Lord Nelson & the Agamemnon look well standing out in the Straits in all Britain has 14 warships here & the French nine, Lord Brassy’s yacht is fitted up as an Hospital Ship & she looks real well The Admiral’s boat along with Gen Hamilton’s arrived after lunch & harboured close alongside the quay Later on the admiral came ashore. Several nurses accompanied by several doctors off one of the hospital ships paid the camp a visit & after a general inspection they went on board again. After went for a short stroll up to the hill from where a beautiful view was obtained of the surrounding country & harbour, every hollow holds a rest camp for convalescents, dozens of them, Had a decent bit of lamp reading last night & again tonight.\n\n21 September 1915\n\nTuesday\n\nHad another splendid night & can now feel myself improving the food is also doing me good, my old skin is coming off in handfuls & at present I present rather a patchy appearance. A hydroplane off the Admirals boat has kept us amused all day by its never ending manoeuvres, 200 Turkish prisoners arrived & we hear that our Left closed in another 100 yards, after tea we were allowed to take a stroll of a couple of hundred yards so we paid a visit to the French who are stationed just below the hospital, they have enough stores on hand to run another war & they’re still making provision for more, their troops are quartered in large sheds & canteen’s figure everywhere their navy is very lax compared to ours & so is their army anything is good enough for them, 4 more troopers & 3 Hospitals boats arrived today the last named points to an engagement. Blasting has gone on all day here \n\n22 September 1915\n\nWednesday 58 wks of soldiering\n\nGetting along splendidly now & gaining strength daily, the submarine parent ship arrived today along with her 5 puppies one of which went for a trip up the Narrows, 2 boatloads of the French left by paddle steamer for Cape Hellas One of our fever patients was operated on for the removal of a shrapnel pellet which has been in his shoulder for weeks he came through OK. Lord Nelson got steam up & went for a short spin but has since returned, the other units of the Navy have been very quiet The Turk prisoners have been busy blasting all day & making new roads along the fore-shore, Four more troopers arrived laden with troops & 3 left at dusk for somewhere Weather has turned very cold & squally & on the Peninsular things must be getting on the cool side.

The canals run every direction about every mile these are damed up & then run off into channels onto the gardens. Date Groves in all stages are seen on every hand. At 2 we arrived at Cairo & were shunted on to our proper line. Cairo is much on the same lines as Alexandria only a little more dirtier if possible on the way Maadi we passed through the Dead City thousands & thousands of houses empty also the Great Pyramids were seen & 5 more further over made camp at 5.00 men arrived at 6. \n\n8 December 1914\n\nTuesday Sailed 7 weeks today\n\nRevielle at 7\n\nFirst thing water & feed, it was good to get back to the old style of camp again.

The roads are exceptionally good here & the village is a very pretty place the population is chiefly native & French & English. All transport is done by the nigs & their horses can pull anything pullable. Toby took bad & had to be attended to by a doctor but during the day picked up a bit & the horses are very restive & to make matters worse there are no bed pegs.

I also visited a native mud village which is too dirty to describe for the nigs only exist & as for washing themselves its unknown the motor the niggers nothing also the donks cant make it out. After dinner all the horses fetlocks were bathed & ointment given to those that needed it for the sand plays havoc on the hoofs. During the night 200 LH came in & tomorrow we expect more.

The criminals from the prison attend to all the quarrying & the worst type are clothed in red to make them conspicuous their boots are also studded in such a manner as to make them a cert for recapture providing they get away.
