Called up Choon by wireless she arrived at 10 am and line on board but Bee would not move Tow line parted and today gave up hope of refloating today waiting till next tide. Low water, one would think that we were in the middle of a green field some lovely coral growing here. Boys got the boat out and went over to a lagoon for a swim Lots of sharks swimming around ship officers shooting at them with revolvers. They are going to have another try to night at 10 Oclock.

That was enough for me So we proceeded on our way We next visited some gardens and then went to the Artillary barracks they were very nice to us there The Garrison were compulsory body from Queensland. We then went back to the town and visited all the most popular places there including a church which had relics of a shipwreck that happened somewhere near here We meet some very nice people here and they tried to make us all at home even the Japanese Just for a few drunks knocking around every one was well pleased for their holiday ashore well its time to go aboard now So am going to get some cocoanuts to take on board.

It was pretty cool for Egypt as we all sought our overcoats. Arrived at Cairo at 4.30 am and waited for daylight to move off to our camp. Moved off 6 am and marched to Ab.... Camp was pretty tired. There were not enough tents for us so had to wait till our officers took it in their heads to get a hustle We did not get into tents till 6 pm Am too tired to go any where to night.\n","40":"\n\nWoke up early and had a look around. Everything is sand and Tents. Our first march on the desert to day and the sand makes it heavy travelling. Mac and I are going to Heliopolis about a mile across the desert. Heliopolis is a new place lots of fine buildings and wide streets all places are built on the French system even the Trams run the same as on the continent. We had a good feed in the Red cross resturant. The one big place here built for a hotel they never got a licence for it. They are using it for a hospital. And it will be called the Australian no I hospital when the lads start fighting Money changers are in the streets and we all changed our English money into\n\nEgyptian money.

The 13th battalion are earned over the other side of Heliopolis. Cairo is a very busy place in the main part of the town. It is full of Hotels and resturants with all kinds of names dance houris and Egyptians sell chocolate and cigarettes shine boots for Vz piastre. We next went to the native quarter Goodness what a filthy place the streets are so narrow that you can hardly pass one another in places There are white Egyptians and black ones some of the women have black veils covering their faces and others have white veils. I was glad when we came out into one of the main streets again. We visited the Egyptian barracks and watched them drill. The drill very nice but the old style of drill. We had a look at the Sultans palace that is a fine building with sentrys all along the front of it. We would have went to the museum but some of the boys got lost so had to give it up as we had no time. We left Cairo early and got out at wrong stop and had a long walk back to camp Very glad to get home again don’t think I will trouble Cairo much. As Heliopolis is nearer and hardly any Egyptians there at all\n","43":"\n\nWhat a day Dust and sand everywhere you can hardly see anything in front of you. Wrote letter to Kathy but had a job writing it as the sand blocked up the ink in the pen. Am going over to see Jimmy OHagan this afternoon.\n\nThere are clouds of Locusts flying about. They are similar to what we call Grasshoppers. Met Jimmy OHagan in Helliopolis and he was very pleased to see me. We both got our boots cleaned and went over to see some of the boys of old E company The are now known D company as the battalions is made up of four companies each with about 250 men and officers saw a lot of fellows I knew We had tea together in Heliopolis I got back to camp.\n","44":"\n\nGot orders to return battalion.

There is not much tucker here I don’t know why. We are always complaining The Egyptian government allow each man sixpence a day and they buy grub with that so there ought not to be any shortage It is a common occurrence to go with out tea here very bad management.\n\nThis is a holiday for us. We are still short of tucker Shall be glad when things alter Battalion have just come home. There is a riot in barrs I believe. They are playing up there They pulled the places to pieces. The place is full of pickets and police are hunting all the troops out of the city They call it the battle of the Wassa.\n","48":"\n\nWe got paid this morning and we are going to the Luna park That is a place like the White City its not very far from our camp.

And moved off at 6 Oclock marched through Abessich and then on to Cairo arriving there at 8.30 AM. Got into train at 9 Oclock and started for Alexandria. We soon got out of Cairo and the country is lovely and green lucern and corn All along the line there are native villages women and men working in the fields I never thought they could turn the desert into one vast plain of agriculture. It is all done by irrigation from the Nile. We crossed the Nile and passed through some very large towns Well one gets tired on looking at the scenery mile after mile We came at last to water so cannot be far of Alexandria. Arrived in Alexandria at 2 pm and went straight aboard the SS Osmanich (AO) She is not fitted up for a troopship no hammocks or any tucker either She is a passenger ship and quite new She used to run to Constantinople before the war anyway this is to be our home till we get to Lemnos. We are not leaving here till tomorrow.

We were relieved at 6 pm and got Iron rations for 24 hours. The 15th Battalion relieved us. The 16th Battalion charged the ridge under our covering fire. They lost a lot of men we could see them dropping down They charged well. We followed at 7 pm and advanced up gully under heavy fire. We turned to the left and 16th to the right We had to cross the skyline for 50 yards before we got to the position we had to take up Well the rifle fire and machine gun fire was something terrible I believe Rene was wounded there I did not see anything of him around the place where we got to. We started to entrench and waited for the New Zealand Otago battalion to join up with us but they failed to link up so had to look after our own position. We got dug in . During the night the Turks .\n\n(Sunday 2nd and","80":" continued)\n\nCounter attacks but they were repulsed. Some reinforcements came up during the night for us They were some of Kitchener’s army called the Nelson Brigade They got between our fire and the Turks and suffered severely At day light the Turks got the whereabouts of our posion and turned machine guns on us that’s where we suffered heavily Men were falling down and getting shot all around me I got the sole of my boot taken off at the time. Further on the left the Nelsons took up position they charged the Turks machine gun but had to retire. They charged again but retired in panic running right across to our old position on Pope’s hill They lost heavily and what got out in the retirement never came up to us again. There were about four of them stopped with us. They were such a Boyish looking lot not like the Australians who act on their own accord when they lose their Officer. The\n\nTommies seem lost without officers. We have hung on here all day and have got orders to retire 7.30. Got all wounded down and got down into gully for a rest I heard that Rene was taken away wounded this morning.
