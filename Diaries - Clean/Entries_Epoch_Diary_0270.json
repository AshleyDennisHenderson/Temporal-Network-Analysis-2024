We are a little north of Wycheate. The A.D.S. is about 1½ miles further on & I believe very comfy. The weather is cold, wet & miserable, snowing off & on. We go to the A.D.S. tomorrow on fatigue work. Heavy bombardment last night in consequence of a raid by Fritz in which we lost many men killed, etc. & \"he\" was successful.\n\nSunday 3 March\n\nDull with drizzling rain. We went to A.D.S. to-day at Woormezeele to work on completing dugouts. Very little is left of the village & some graves about mention","62":" Battle of Ypres.

Went to Kemmel M.D.S. for mail. Gas guard tonight.\n","65":"\n\nOn guard at Brasserie, between Kemmel & Ypres. The A.D.S. at Woormezeele is 3000 yards direct from Ypres & our line is above famous Hill 60.\n","66":"\n\nOn fatigue at A.D.S., working on the dugout.\n\nLast night Fritz shelled the line for four hours with \"mustard gas\" & about one hundred casualties to 9th Battn. was the result. Colonel, Adjutant, & Capt. Phillips (1st F. Amb.), M.O., were gassed. Some cases were very bad & came down on the light railway, eyes & other parts of the body were affected. The cases were pitiful. Glorious day.\n\nGo up to the posts on Sunday.\n","67":"\n\nWorking on dugout at A.D.S. & it is just about complete. Weather glorious.\n","68":"\n\nBeautiful day. Spring is here & to-night Summer time comes into operation, the clock put forward one hour. We go up to the line to-morrow in front of famous Hill 60.\n","69":"\n\nAt Mount Sorrel relay post nearby Hill 60 & just to the right of Zillebeke Lake which can be seen from here. The morning was very quiet indeed but this afternoon some 5.9’s fell close about doing little other harm than covering my tunic & some blankets with mud. Coming up we crossed the Ypres-Commines Canal & in fact Ypres is not very far on our left. The line is a series of outposts, some good & others not too bright.\n\nOur dugout was over a \"pill box\", but has been blown in & decently repaired.\n\nWeather beautiful.\n","70":"\n\nVery quiet on the front to-day. Infantry changed over last night, but no casualties. A raid about 11.30 p.m. on our right appeared to be in progress. Only two casualties so far from R.A.P. Beautiful day. Our post is the easiest I have yet been on & we push the patients on a tram line for about ¾ of a mile. The country about is hilly sloping away to Ypres on the north & has been much battered about in the Battle of Messines.\n","71":"\n\nGlorious day & very quiet except on Hill 60, which is intermittently shelled.\n\nA beautiful day & Ypres Cloth Hall, Lake Zillebeke & a couple of ruined villages are plainly discernible on our left.\n","72":"\n\nVery quiet on the front, and what few casualties there are are from gas.\n\nWe are living well, & doing nothing. Our meals are far better than we get at camp & I am No. 4 & chef.\n","73":"\n\nWet to-day. In a raid last night by 10th & 12th Battns. on our left, fifty prisoners were brought in. Fritz dropped a few showers of whiz-bangs about our dugout to-day some close. They appear to have been a H.E. shell & a sneezing gas the object being to render one unable to wear the respirator. We opened a bombardment on Fritz to-night at 9.30 but so far no retaliation.\n","74":"\n\nA wounded case this morning. Fritz attempted a raid on our left this morning & we heard his barrage. No idea as to results. Glorious day. Fritz shelled our vicinity heavily for the greater part of the day but fruitlessly. Glorious day & Ypres stands out very distinctly. The \nGerman\n bombardment last night signified also a raid by Tommies on our left at 9.30 p.m. but no idea as to results.\n","75":"\n\nA beautiful Spring day. Fritz shelled about our dugout this morning & to-night he is continuing it with heavy stuff & fifty yards away are the distance. No carries.\n","76":"\n\nVery quiet on the front to-day up till about 5 p.m. when the Bosche guns began to speak in salvoes & sent gas all round us. The attack is still in progress at midnight. Beautiful clear day, much aerial work & a fine moonlit night. A view of the German line from the top of Mount Sorrel shows the town of Commines (?) (Warneton) almost intact the church spire showing out well.\n","77":"\n\nBeautiful day but warm & showing a slight tendency to rain. Fritz has shelled Hill 60 to-day all day with very heavy stuff & the valley between us & the hill has been covered with a smoke pall all day. It is the most vigorous bombardment of one place I have seen since Pozieres. The Gas is being sent over to-night in small quantities & last night we had a carry through it. Heaviest gas attack I have seen but only one or two casualties were the results. I doubt whether the bombardment of Hill 60 caused many casualties.\n\nRelieved to-morrow. \n","78":"\n\nRaining all day to-day making things muddy & miserable. We were relieved this morning & are now back at Voormezeele Advanced Dressing Station.\n\nEither last night or the (? night) previous night Fritz dropped a shell in the back store at the M.D.S. at Kemmell, eight miles or so behind the line. Johns was in at the time & apart from almost being hurled out the roof he escaped with a gash in the face & a broken nose.\n\n20th March\n\nI have just seen a remarkable order issued by the O.C., 3rd Field Ambulance to whom we are attached to the effect that in the event of heavy shelling of the A.D.S. all except on special duty are to evacuate the place & retire to Brasserie for instructions.\n","79":"\n\nAt Vormeezeele I went for a bath. Though wet this morning it is now beautifully fine & moonlit. Apparently this much advertised German offensive is not to be delayed too long but I think the main attack will be delivered against the French. However the artillery activity on this front has shown a marked increase during the last week or so. He is shelling heavily all the back areas here, Kemmel & as far back as Balliel, Meteren, Strazeele, Hazebrouck, etc. On our part our artillery defence is marked & even behind of our 25\" & 12\" guns are batteries of 18 pdrs. Such preparations for a German blow I haven’t seen before. Rumour has it that notice has been given to inhabitants of villages near the line to evacuate & also that the M.D.S. at Kemmel should be moved. I can’t say what is in the rumours. Rumour about spies are also rife.\n","80":"\n\nBeautiful day. Last night Fritz drenched the front with gas again & many cases are coming through, also wounded. Fritz is still continuing his shelling the back areas & to-day I went to the M.D.S. at Kemmel just in time to see eight H.V. shells land in the camp grounds. In fact he has been shelling Kemmel vigorously, always in the Hospital grounds & our people are evacuating it to-day. The back store has been blown up for a second time.\n","81":"\n\nVery quiet day at A.D.S., practically no shelling.\n\nRumour is to hand that the German offensive has commenced & they have attacked the British & French fronts on many mile fronts. It is said that the French have repulsed all attacks but that Bullecourt, Lagnicourt & Havrincourt have been taken from the British. Whether these rumours are correct I cannot say.\n","82":"\n\nOn fatigue work building dugouts at Spoil bank, on the Ypres-Comines canal. Everything very quiet, except that Fritz shelled St. Eloi. Glorious spring day. Rumours still rife as to German offensive. No reliable information.\n","83":"\n\nBeautiful day.\n\nThe Ludinoff Offensive has developed & rumour has it that he has advanced to a depth of two to fourteen miles into the Somme area attacking from Arras to La Fere, against the English & French. Apparently some Australians are going down & to-day we are preparing to take over more front to the right of our last sector, relieving the 5th Div. We moved to a place on the Wycheate-Kemmel road & to-morrow we go up to the line on our new sector just to North of Messines.\n\nMonday 25 March\n\nThis morning early we moved up to the front to the N. of Messines & E. of Wyscheate. The front is very quiet indeed & is a network of tram tracks. The German fortifications are great, consisting of dozens of concrete pill boxes.\n\nOf course this ground was taken from him in","84":" From our post the R.A.P., a great view is to be had of the ground now in German hands & many villages can be distinctly seen with the naked eye. No news of the German offensive.\n\nBeautiful Spring weather.\n","85":"\n\nYe Gods! an officer has just told me that the fighting in the offensive is now taking place in High Wood ! Somme. It speaks for itself to anyone who knows the country. However, I believe the Bosche has paid heavily for his great advance, which compared with ours of the last two years has been lightning like.\n","86":"\n\nSecond anniversary of our seeing France, the town & beautiful harbour of Toulon. Papers & information from G.H.Q. confirms the rumours of the German advance, as far as High Wood, Bernafay. Ye Gods, the papers report that a German gun is firing on Paris from a distance of 75 miles. Glorious day & very quiet on our front.\n\nA Fritz ‘plane came over our lines last night & to-night & flew very low indeed & still he is O.K.\n","87":"\n\nWet & miserable today. News to-day of the Arras-Quentin-la Fere, battle is disconcerting & our line is now west of the old line from which we attacked in 1916. In fact Albert is in German hands. The offensive began on 21st inst. Fritz is shelling our vicinity with gas just now.\n","88":"\n\nGood Friday. Wet. Last night Fritz shelled about here fairly heavily catching a battery. We had two trips out & much gas was in evidence.\n","89":"\n\nWet & miserable to-day but still very quiet on the front. A German airman very daringly came very low over our lines & escaped scot free. News from the Somme still disconcerting & the advance is in one place 25 miles deep & in another 15 miles from Amiens.\n","90":"\n\nStill particularly quiet on the front, but it is said that there is a raid coming off to-night. There is a German Labour Battn. holding the line opposite us. This month has been a month of wonders, & the Ludendorff Offensive which now is twenty five miles deep from La Fere to Montdider, & now the Germans are ten miles from Amiens & can shell the Amiens-Paris railway. Prisoners are 70000 & Guns 1100, according to Berlin & in my opinion & in spite of expressions to the contrary, the British High Command was caught napping. Then the new era in guns, the shelling of Paris from 75 miles distance, is a wonder to be wondered at.\n","91":"\n\nGlorious day. Raid never came off. We were relieved this afternoon & are now back at the Brasserie. Of course there is no doubt as to our next move which in my opinion to the Somme, where still heavy fighting continues. This is the first time I have felt genuinely sorry to leave the line. So quiet & happy we were. Easter Monday & April Fool’s day, caught nicely. Rather curious to see an Australian saluting an English Colonel in sight of the enemy at R.A.P.\n","92":"\n\nGlorious day. Move from the Brasserie & joined up the unit at Reninghelst & move again on to Hoograf just on the outskirts of Poperinghe. There are few troops in this area but much movement is in evidence presumably up & down to the Somme, where things have quietened a little. The propogander for saving food etc., has been extended to areas in France in occupation of British troops, in shapes of notices to \"Eat Less & Save Shipping\" & many others. A walk round some of our old haunts round in Poperinghe. A very amusing incident to-day. We bearers were .\n","93":" AprilWet to-day.\n\nA walk round to Remi Siding & round the district. The view of Poperinge through the trees & hop poles & across the waving wheat fields is fine, exactly what I pictured of Flemish scenery. This is the third time I have been in this district & I like it, in spite of its flatness & occasional objectional smell caused by the manuring of the fields. Nothing doing on the Somme but we entrain for there soon.\n","94":"\n\nStill wet & cloudy.\n\nA walk round old haunts round Poperinghe.\n","95":"\n\nStill wet & prospects of more rain. A walk round to Remi Siding & a look over the grave yard at the C.C.S’s which grew very much as the result of the Ypres stunts.We move tomorrow &entrain for the Somme where things seems to be livening up for a German attack.\n","96":"\n\nWhat luck. After many days rain to-day is fine for moving. We marched from Hoograf to Godewaersvelde where we entrained. The march lay along the base of the Mont des Cats & I was on the wheel stretchers – pack. Godewaersvelde of course is in France. At 2 a.m. we are now at Amiens on the Somme & Fritz is about eight-ten miles out towards Albert & St. Quentin. A journey, via St. Omer, Calais, Boulogne & Abbeville was made in cattle trucks. Our billets are about 4 kilos out on the Abbeville road.\n\nThe City of Amiens is full of inhabitants from villages within the new danger zone & they naturally think things are very black. In a big attack last week four uhlans were seen in here & repulsed by Armoured Cars!! Marvellous how they got through.\n","97":"\n\nWe are now at Longpre – not where we were in","98":" - on Somme River and about five miles or so from Amiens. The country about is looking well and the Cathedral looms out from here, dominating everything about. We marched through the town last night & arrived here at 5 a.m. It was a weird march, no lights except an occasional torch flashed on to the tall houses on either side of the road, the waggons rumbling over the cobbles & raining occasionally. Fritz is only nine miles from the town & I suppose the inhabitants are on pins & needles over the issue which centres round the town. This village & the towns & villages about are full of refugees. Yesterday the Bosche advanced three miles & took Bresle & heavily attacked the Australian front but was repulsed. He is shelling the towns about here from sounds, presumably Amiens. It is sad to see old couples, with their belongings in handkerchiefs on the road to Abbeville. Beautiful day. No orders yet until 4 p.m.\n\nMonday 8 April\n\nStill at Longpre-les-Amiens. The day is wet & miserable, but I managed to go for a dry walk along the bank of the Somme. It is a shame to see the people, old & young, coming out from Amiens with their belongings on their backs & barrows etc.\n\nLast night fine, the Bosche bombed all round this district & yesterday he shelled Amiens. The artillery work last night & to-day was heavy & the bursts from German shells were distinctly audible. The people about here have very little faith in the English Army from their remarks. The French General Fayolle is now the man as by his strategy he saved the French left, which was jeopardized by the English withdrawal.\n\nMuch traffic on all lines of railway.\n","99":"\n\nWet to-day. This afternoon to Bertangles, north of Amiens about nine kilometres.\n\nWe are camped under canvas on a decent hill overlooking the biggest airdrome I have yet seen. Heavy bombardment on the front from early morning & is going now & extended back as far as west of Amiens.\n","100":"\n\nYe Gods, Fritz has attacked in the north about Fleurbaix, etc. & captured Saily sur la Lys, Laventie & Estaires. The bombardment, very heavy continued until early this morning on this front & was very intense. Wet off & on to-day & a walk to Villers Bocace. Fritz is marvellous!!! The above is so far only a rumour confirmed by Corps H.Q., & I cannot say on what front he has attacked. Our camp here is very decent, but there is no water. Whilst we were in bed to-night we were warned with tragic suddenness to be ready to move in the morning to entrain for the north.\n\nThursday 11 April\n\nGlorious day & very warm. Artillery livened up to-day on this front.\n\nYesterday’s rumour has been confirmed by the English papers. We are not moving to-day but perhaps to-morrow, entraining for the north. The casualties of the Australian Divisions, 3rd & 4th on this front have been very heavy indeed but they have acquitted themselves magnificently, repelling attacks & charging brilliantly with fixed bayonets.\n\nGen. Gough in charge of","101":" Army has been recalled over the initial failure to hold Fritz on his front. Had to bivouac to-night & it rained for about 30 minutes. What a short sojourn to the Somme!!\n","102":"\n\nMove from Bertangles this morning, on to Amiens where we are to entrain this afternoon for the north. The front of the Bosche’s attack has been extended to twenty miles from La Bassee to the north. Things here are fairly quiet but he has been shelling Amiens heavily both to-day & yesterday when he put two into the Cathedral. \"O to have seen what I have seen\" to-day in marching through Amiens. Many houses have been knocked rotten & all over the place one passes one or two belated refugees with their belongings on their back & on various modes of conveyance. The roads are crowded with refugees & it makes one more sad than ever over this business. We entrained at Amiens & drew out of the town for a couple of hours. Beautiful night & the German ‘planes came over in droves dropping many bombs. One brought down.\n","103":"\n\nNow just out of Hazebrouck where we detrain after coming up via Doullens, St. Pol & Lillers. Things up here are very confused & rumours are current as to the extent of the advance. Some say the fighting is now round Merris & Strazeele. We are forming an A.D.S. immediately. All along the railway line are signs of recent bombing by the Germans. The A.D.S. is at Borre on Hazebrouck-Ballieul Road & the Australians dug in on the Strazeele heights immediately after marching off the train. The Guards & 29th Division are here, the men of the latter being very drunk & disorderly.\n","104":"\n\nA rotten North wind to-day. No news from the line. Still near St. Sylvestre Cappel, 4 or 5 kilos from Hazebrouck. Everywhere you see troops who have been lost & at the 1st A.C.C.S., things were left in an awful hurry. Line seems to be Nieppe Forest Estaires-Merris-Steenwerke, Ballieul being still in our hands. French troops are in the vicinity.\n\nThe vicinity still throngs with refugees, poor beggars, young & old, living in tents under tarpaulins anywhere along the road.\n","105":"\n\nMove again to the northern outskirts of Hazebrouck where we are in very good billets.\n\nFritz is shelling round about causing much consternation among the remainder of the poor civilians who still persist in clinging to their homes. Good God it is pitiful to see them!!\n\nTwo casualties to Ambulance, Gleeson died of wounds, Clareson wounded. Yesterday the Bosche attacked our front, with all his transport following closely behind his infantry expecting an easy break through. What a shock he received!! Our M.G’s simply mowed him down at 100 yards range & scattered his transport in all directions. He evinced great surprise on meeting Australians, so two prisoners taken. To our brigade about 1000 Tommy stragglers are attached.\n","106":"\n\nOur people are to attack to-night in conjunction with the French. We have been sent up to A.D.S. at Borre as reserve bearers. Quiet just now. Rumour has it that Fritz has driven the British back to a kilo from Ypres and captured nine hundred guns. Of course we, the 1st, are the only Australian Division on this front.\n","107":"\n\nFritz is shelling heavily all round this morning & we have now learnt that he attacked heavily but was beaten back. We are now up the line, plenty of work but things have quietened down again. \"We are living in a farm\" which has been left by the owners with all their property in kind & chattels all over the place & we have prospects of living on pork, fowl, etc. Our front is somewhere about Merris, Ballieul, Meteren & is covered with roaming stock, cows, goats, etc. It makes one heart bleed to walk through the deserted rooms of this house where everything is topsy turvy, & see little articles of feminine fancy tossed in all directions, visiting cards, etc. & I thank God that Australia is where it is.\n","108":"\n\nThings to-day have been very quiet indeed & we have been at the R.A.P. since 2.30 a.m. & have had no case. Meteren, or the vicinity is on fire & the shelling on the left, French front, has been heavy. I cannot get any definite information as to who holds Meteren. The French 75’s are very busy just now. Ninety per cent of the Boche’s artillery is small 4.2 & 77’s. Two prisoners last night, one officer & a corporal. No news from any other part of the front. Living well.\n\nHeavy winds to-day.\n","109":"\n\nVery sorry to be relieved from this post this morning as things were quiet & we were living exceedingly well.

News is to hand to-day of the re-commencement of the German offensive & he has attacked the French between Soissons & Rhiems. He had initial success, but I cannot say to what extent.

Our casualties were wonderfully light, about one fifty including forty Germans going through Borre. Everyone concerned was highly pleased. Practically no shelling by Fritz & no counter attack. Glorious day. The","155":" & 11th Battns. were the attacking force, part only of 10th. The fact of the great number of prisoners is due to Fritz changing over when the attack started. The 29th Division on our right also did very well.\n\nTuesday 4 June\n\nStill glorious weather & we are back at Borre, only to go up to-morrow evening for another eight days. The German prisoners who came through yesterday though very cheerful, were very poor specimens, 12th & 39th Reserve divisions. The habit of \"ratting\" them for their personal property, disgusting to say the least, was carried out by some thoroughly. Some of the incidents were very amusing.\n\nWednesday 5 June\n\nMove into the line again, to the same post as previously, Strazeele Station. At midnight we had a carry & nearing the relay I was hit in the chest left side by a piece of flying metal. Narrow shave for the heart but it is only a scratch, however necessitating A.T. injection. Sent to Borre for a while.\n\nThursday 6 June\n\nUp at the Aid Post again, but before I left Borre I saw the most thrilling air fight of my life. The Bosch, in a machine almost red, was endeavouring to elude four of our chaps & after most magnificent manouvering, very low down had to land at Hazebrouck. It is said that he has twenty three machines to his credit & apparently belonged to the famous \"circus\" formed by the late Richtoften.\n","156":"\n\nThings are very quiet here to-day.

News of a brilliantly successful attack from Rheims, the French retaking Soissons & I think that that front is our destination.\n","215":"\n\nFine to-day.\n\nA walk round the country this afternoon & the country is beautiful, cropped heavily & nicely timbered in the valleys. The view from the hill to the south includes Cyere Lillers & the slag heaps of Bethune.\n","216":"\n\nNothing doing to-day but we are warned to move off in the morning at 12.45 to entrain at I think Wizernes for Longpre near Abbeville, where we are to join up our corps. Pictures to-night were decent. It is a ten kilo march to the station & the night is wet.\n\nI hate wet night marches above anything.\n","217":"\n\nOn the Somme for the fourth time!!! At 12.45 this morning we moved from Racquingham to Wizernes about ten to twelve kilos & entrained & travelled via Calais & Abbeville to Pont Remy about 11 kilos form Abbeville where we detrained. We then marched about ten miles past our old billets at Bouchon, over the Somme, past L’Etoile to Vauchelles le Domart, where we billet for to-night. Although raining a little on the early march we did not get wet & this last march was in beautiful weather. A stunt is eminent & our division is participate even after over 100 days at a stretch on the Hazebrouck. I would be surprised if our ambulance does any part in this stunt, but on exactly what front, I cannot say.\n","218":"\n\nThis country is looking fine, rolling miles of crops and \"roses are blooming in Picardy\". This village is a typical Somme village, with a church a couple of estaminets & a few houses. Nearby is a Chateau where we are at a concert by R.A.F. We move to-night to just past Amiens. A big stunt is eminent. Have dinner with my little friend at Moulin Blue.\n","219":"\n\nThe stunt came off & was a huge success so news from 4th Army says. Six miles deep is the advance & all objectives were taken ahead of time, tanks, cavalry, etc. operating. Heavens, Rumours are flying, but whatever happened has been a huge success. Australians, Canadians, British & French are at least participating.\n\nWe are on the move marching from Vauchelles to Saint Sauveur, on the Somme, just west of Amiens. Our route lay through fine country along Abbeville-Amiens road & we are getting, for a change, well fed. Fine day for march. We are now at St. Sauveur & here catch motor transport for Allonville. From St. Sauveur we travelled via Amiens (where there are yet some civilians) to Allonville, where we were over two years ago. Bivouac in the Chateau woods. Rumours about stunt are flying.\n\nBayonvillers. On Amiens- \nSt. Quentin\n Nesle Rd.\n","220":"\n\nMove again from Allonville to Corby, M.D.S. on the Somme, in which we had a swim. This place is just behind Villers Brettoneux & just to right and about five kilos ahead. Again to-night we moved further out across the country over which our troops advanced to an A.D.S. at Bay on villers. Heavens our troops have advanced & even now though five miles over the old German line, we are yet miles behind. Our marching to-day has been about fifteen miles & to-night Fritz is bombing & caught some chaps nearby. No shell fire much, but a number of casualties. Meet Roy Jamieson. All Divisions are in this & thousands of prisoners have been taken. The advance is about ten miles on this part, through villages of Warfuses, Bayonvillers & Harbonierre which of course have been smashed about.\n","221":"\n\nEarly this morning we moved up to Brigade H.Q. just behind a C.C.S. once used by us & taken by Fritz in his advance on March 21st. It is now in our hands again & standing. It is just near Rosieres taken by the Canadians yesterday. The front line is just over the ridge ahead of us, about ¾ mile on. Aerial activity is great, two planes probably Boshe, being brought down in flames this afternoon. I should say we are well over eight miles from our old front line. Fritz is now shelling locally & fairly consistently. Harbonierre is a village we passed through to-day not badly damaged.\n","222":"\n\nOur front lies about 800-1000 yards east of the village of Lêhon, about five kilos along this road, Nesle-Amiens. Last night or this morning our people moved up again some distance capturing a few prisoners, some M.G.s & about six 77’s. Fritz replied with heavy shelling especially about here & our casualties were three, Groves, Ridgeway (serious) & Sgt. McRae. Also Sgt. Sellers was hit whilst we were coming in last afternoon. All day Fritz has been shelling the ridge ahead of us & his planes have been active downing one of balloons. Our people brought down two of his ‘planes in flames yesterday on this sector. Possibly move up further to-night & it is rumoured that there is a big stunt in the morning.\n","223":"\n\nLast night was fairly quiet, except for the four 6 inch guns in front of us, about fifty yards from us. Fritz shelled a bit using gas & H.E. but not much, last night & to-day.\n\nThe stunt did not come off. Australian mail very welcome. Another casualty. Prewer wounded, making five to date in this salient.\n","224":"\n\nPoor old Ridgeway died of his wounds. Wonderfully quiet all day, but very hot.\n\nSeveral ‘planes have come down in flames & I think that one must have been ours.\n\nA C.C.\n The village of Rosieres just on our right is one huge dump.\n","225":"\n\nA German ‘plane brought down by the A.A.’s this morning. Just now a Boshe plane chased one of our R.E. 8s old slow artillery observers extremely low down & brought him down about a hundred yards away. It was the coolest thing I have seen, two miles or more over our line but of course our plane had no hope at all. Very hot again to-day.\n\nFritz heavily shelling Vauvillers just on our left.\n","226":"\n\nStill heavy shelling on our left. We are to be relieved to-morrow & already 4th Aust. Division & some Americans are up here. Quiet just here.\n","227":"\n\nMove this morning at ten a.m. & march through the boiling hot sun & dust, heavens, it was dusty via Harbonierres, Bayonvillers & Warfuses to Vaux sur Somme & were very much refreshed by a swim in the river. Another of the chaps has died, Groves, very unfortunately. Bivouac for the night.\n","228":"\n\nIndulging in early morning swims in the Somme. A walk along the river to Sailly le Sec which is badly battered about. Fine & warm.\n","229":"\n\nGloriously fine weather continues but everything is very quiet. News is scarce.\n","230":"\n\nGlorious weather still. Walk along the river almost to Corbie & it is very pretty flanked with poplar trees.\n","231":"\n\nGlorious day & still at Vaux sur Somme, where we daily indulge in a swim in the river.\n\nGlorious moonlit night. We move up again shortly.\n","232":"\n\nVery hot all day & I enjoyed a glorious swim in the river. Australian mail.\n\nWe bearers move up to-night on the South of the Somme in the vicinity of Proyart for a pretty big stunt.\n","233":"\n\nAt 10.30 last night we moved to a quarry on the outskirts of Mericourt sur Somme, where we arrived at 2 a.m. this morning. Everything is now quiet & the line is not too far away. Rumour hath it that some troops went over this morning & took Bray sur Somme. Certainly the artillery here was active. Very hot all day & Fritz has been shelling the village all day off & on. We are camping in the village, in a cellar, to-night.\n","234":"\n\nAt 4 a.m. or a little later our barrage opened & the 1st Division went over & advanced at least 3000 yards more likely more, but news is scarce & the actual result is indefinite. However, it was a success & over 3000 prisoners have been taken, many coming through our post & helping to evacuate the wounded. The wounded of course were many but not extraordinary & I believe Fritz shelled heavily but here in the back area I only heard about ten all told .Our casualties, all lightly wounded till now and Pearn, Cartaar, Bourke & Fritcroft, all lightly wounded. A big percentage of wounded were Boshes. Still at loading post Mericourt-sur-Somme.\n","235":"\n\nA very quiet night. This morning we moved up to 4th Battn. R.A.P. in front of Chyvolles where yesterday there was plenty of work, but everything is quiet to-day & in fact we have a Ford car right up here. A good dugout, old French, about a kilo or so over the old front line & dug in the leeward of a good hill. Spasmodic shelling but no casualties.\n","236":"\n\nShelling off & on all day & a few cases but of course taken by the ford except a few this morning & one to-night in the pouring rain. We are now just to the right of & behind Chignes to the South of the Somme River. Prisoners are now estimated at 2,400,000 unwounded & our casualties were not remarkably heavy for the extent of the stunt, & it was most successful.\n","237":"\n\nFine` to-day & very quiet. We, the Division, is to be releived to-night. Rumours of big offensive all along British line & part of French are current. A big blow is supposed to be struck here to-morrow. Just up the Chignes road is a tremendous German gun which I had a look at to-night. It is about 15\" with very long barrel & its mountings etc. are enormous. Guns are being moved up to here, quite close to the line.\n","238":"\n\nAt Morcourt sur Somme where we are to rest for a few days just behind the new balloon line. We came out last night & everything is very quiet. Our Division’s advance is highly mentioned in the papers & also is the 15\" gun I saw yesterday. I expect we will be in again in a week.\n","239":"\n\nWet to-day but find time to go for a walk round the hills overlooking the Somme & villages of Cerises & Chipilly. Our line here has been advanced again & is the right flank of the 50 mile attack to the North. Aquatic sports to-morrow.\n","240":"\n\nAquatic sports this afternoon in a pond just off the river were very decent, \"A\" Section taking all honours with their best men, Green, Pollet & Barton. Rumour says that Peronne has fallen to our troops to-day.\n","241":"\n\nA dinner to-night in the church at Morcourt which was a tremendous success with a 1st Battn. band in attendance & the distribution of the prizes won yesterday. It is absolutely the best unit dinner in history. In responding to a eulogy \"Bib\" said \"that we had a good dinner to-night ‘cos the rations came from the canteen & regimental funds but to-morrow when I get the rations from the Q.M. stores I will be a b—\". Very funny indeed.\n\nRumour of a great attack in the south by American troops & others in two days time.\n","242":"\n\nSeptember weather showery off & on. Went to see some captured German guns, 8\", 5.9’s, all of which have sent shells back to their late owners. On guard to-night.\n","243":"\n\nNothing doing here at Morcourt which is now miles from the war. In fact we can’t hear the guns & can only just see the balloons.\n","244":"\n\nA walk this afternoon to Proyart from where our division hopped off last stunt.\n\nThere are now two C.C.S.’s there now. Saw a number of German guns including three 5.9 navals in position. Changeable weather. On our front Mont St. Quentin & Peronne have been taken.\n","245":"\n\nNothing doing here. Weather changeableRumour that we go in the line on Friday.\n\nBritish still advance into the Hindenburg line.\n","246":"\n","247":"\n\nRumour that we move up to the line to-morrow which is now a great distance from here.\n","248":"\n\nMove to-day from Morcourt to Halle on the Albert-Peronne road. We came by Bray, Suzette & Maricourt & we are now camped in a quarry, just north of the Somme & on the old Somme battlefield of 1916. The country is desolate just as it was when we were at Flers in 1916. Rumour that Fritz was driven back yesterday & the A.D.S. even is about 3½ kilos East of Peronne. Just on our left is Mont St. Quentin, not much of an eminence but commanding all approaches to it.\n","249":"\n\nFine day with a swim in the Somme just W. of Peronne. This afternoon a walk to Mont St. Quentin over which the French had to fight in 1916-17 & which our chaps had a victory a week ago. It is a dominating position over looking the ruins of Peronne about a kilo away & the river. It is well fortified but literally strewn with German dead.\n\nThe Balloons moved forward to-day so our line must have advanced. We move to-morrow to Doignt, on river Cologne, S.E. of Peronne.\n","250":"\n\nMove this morning to Doignt about four miles. Our route lays through the outskirts of Peronne, which is badly knocked about. Peronne is a moated town of great historic importance, Quentin Durward etc. Wet to-day. Living in a cellar in a decent one time concrete houses. A walk round the village cemetry shows where the Germans have opened up tombs & taken the metal from coffins. In one the body (half decomposed) is lying in full view & bones are to be seen all over the place.\n\nTransferred from bearers to clerical duties.\n","251":"\n\nMove this afternoon to Buire where we are to establish a M.D.S. in bow huts which our people built in 1917 & had to evacuate again. About nine kilos from the line.\n","252":"\n\nWorking about M.D.S. fixing things up generally for work. The division takes over to-night at midnight & our bearers are already up, with the battalions.\n","253":"\n\nLast night the Boshe bombed, causing many casualties. Take over new duties, in A & D room. The 4th Battn. had a stunt this morning, but was unsuccessful taking their objective but being shelled out again with a good number of casualties.\n","254":"\n\nWet off & on all day. Very few casualties to-day.\n","255":"\n\nLast night the A.D.S. retired to Tincourt because of shelling. Fine day & night & the Boshe bomb-birds were very busy but not without opposition. It is great to see the plane caught in a dozen lights from all round, shining like a great moth with archies bursting all round & tracer bullets going up from our M.G.s. One brought down in flames & another under apparent control both throwing out plenty of flares.\n\nScore 1 for archies!!\n","256":"\n","257":"\n\nNot very busy to-day or yesterday & nothing at all happened to break the usual routine of M.D.S. Railway broad gauge is now past here.\n","258":"\n\nA big stunt is impending on this front, to come off in a few days.\n\nGlorious night, moonlit, with Boshe ‘planes in dozens.\n","259":"\n\nLast night a night of incidents. In a motor ride to C.C.S. at La Chapelete we got lost & went all over the country in moonlight. Fritz bombed the other side of the village (Buire) causing casualties including killed. A most terrific storm flooded me out my place in hut.\n\nFritz shelled the camp area causing us to take refuge in dugouts. The big stunt is for to-morrow & we expect to be very busy. Dummy tanks are to be used to draw fire from the Boshe.\n","260":"\n\nEarly this morning, after a beautiful barrage, our chaps went over in part of a general attack & advanced about 6 kilos taking 1500 prisoners, 14 field guns & many M.G.s. Our casualties for the day, 1st Division are 43 & very light. Belleux & Hargicourt were taken by our brigade.\n\nPlenty of work at M.D.S.\n","261":"\n\nMany men leave this week for Australia on a six months furlough stunt. Lucky beggars.\n\nThe 1st Aust. Division now holds two records, 1. holding the line continuously for about 130 days, (2) the record for the greatest numbers of guns & prisoners captured in one day by one division.\n","262":"\n\nA walk this afternoon to Tincourt over the hills. A small stunt is coming off in the morning & then the Division comes out for a good long spell.\n","263":"\n\nAmericans are appearing on this front & soon we are to be relieved & I think for a good long spell behind the war area.\n","264":"\n\nAmid much handshaking & good wishes fourteen 1914 men left the unit for Australia this morning. In the Orderly Room as \"A\" section clerk from to-day. Wet.\n","265":"\n\nTo-morrow we are to move to Herbecourt preparatory to entraining for the West of Amiens.\n\nYanks why they are here by thousands the 30th Division relieving us. Tanks are also here by the \nthe\n dozens & soon I think the Hindenburg line is to be attacked & I think carried by the enthusiastic Yanks.\n","266":"\n\nGlorious day. Move to Biaches or remains thereof via Peronne & thence across river at Halle. Good march on good roads. Possibly entrain to-morrow.\n","267":"\n","268":"\n\nMove from Biaches, marching to La Chapelette & after awful delay, by train via Brie, Chaulnes, Rosieres & Amiens to Longpre where we detrained. An awful journey partly in open trucks.\n","269":"\n\nEarly this morning we arrived at Pont Remy where we are now living. We have been house hunting all day, funniest experience imaginable & finally got a nice room with nice people. This village on the river is pretty, 8 kilos from Abbeville but is full of all kinds of people, including W.A.A.Cs. Thank Heaven for a sight of civilization again.\n","270":"\n","271":"\n\nVisit Abbeville to-day by train & walk home along the road. Abbeville has been fairly extensively bombed & knocked about but we found a fine hotel for dinner & visited","272":" A.G.H. having the d’apres midi with Miss Murdoch, Eric Grenville’s friend.\n","273":"\n\nUsual routine at Pont Remy & walks around the village.\n","274":"\n","275":"\n","276":"\n\nGlorious day & Pont Remy & the river is looking well. Thirty three originals left for home this morning. To-morrow I go on leave to England via Calais.\n","277":"\n\nAt Bolougne in rest camp after a decent days journey, En route for my leave to England. Quite a decent day & evening in Bolougne. Go to Calais to-morrow & embark there.\n","278":"\n\nCrossing Calais to Dover rough. Dover to Victoria St. & get a glimpse of Canterbury Cathedral. Charing Cross Hotel. Accommodation is hard to get, the Strand Palace & Hassells Hotels being crowded.\n","279":"\n\nChurch, Dr. Jowat. Richmond for the afternoon & evening. Once back in London one feels that one has never left it so completely does it banish France from the mind.\n\nOf course rationing is in force, but there is no shortage of food.\n","280":"\n\nWindsor all day. \"The Boy\" at night. Windsor & \nEato\n Eton is a fine & scrupulously clean town. The Castle is fine & the view therefrom, of the river & the country for miles is glorious. Eton College stands out well.\n","281":"\n\nLeave London.\n","282":"\n\nArrive in Edinburgh on a wet day but still can do the Castle, Royal Mile & the Holyrood Palace, all places abounding in history. The Royal Mile however, loses all its historical beauty, by the awful condition of the people living there. George Hotel.\n","283":"\n\nAnother walk round the lower part of the Royal Mile to Holyrood Castle.\n\nEdinburgh is the finest city I have yet been in, a city of liesure, learning & refinement. Business is not brisk & the Streets are seas of smiling faces. The general opinion of the people I have met is to have no peace until the Germans are thoroughly defeated.\n","284":"\n\nForth Bridge by a char-a-banc. The drive is very fine indeed & the country & autumn colouring in the trees are glorious. The Bridge impressed me very much & is a tremendous structure. \"Fair & Warmer\" this evening.\n","285":"\n\nArrive in Glasgow & at once start sight seeing. The Rouken Glen & Botanic Gardens & then University & Art Gallery. Glasgow, in great contrast to Edinburgh, is a city of business, many people in the streets. There are signs of sedition here too, & many seditious notices are chalked about the pavements.\n\nBlythswood Hotel.\n","286":"\n\nA fine day but not clear. A visit to Loch Lomond, Balloch, but no steamers running.\n\nNo doubt, the lake is beautiful, but I was far from being moved when I saw it. Possibly expected too much. Balloch Park is very fine. A walk round Glasgow this evening in a crowd of people of which I have seen no equal.\n","287":"\n\n\"The first thing which I remember as an event in life was being taken by my nurse to the brow of Friars Crag on Derwent Water.\" John Ruskin. Arrived at Keswick on Derwent water from Glascow, via Carlisle & Penrith this afternoon. Friars Cragg & Castle Head, are spots glorious, both commanding views of Derwentwater & the latter of the finest panorama I have yet seen in my life. The run down from Glasgow is great, crossing & re-crossing river after river & the colouring of trees & bracken is glorious.\n\nRoyal Oak Hotel.\n","288":"\n\nAn all day trip to Buttermere & Crummock lakes. This country the poets country is all I expected it to be & I cannot say more. This trip is unique along the Borrodale Valley & over the Honister pass, back via Devils Elbow. One walks over the Honister Pass but it is well worth it. The hills crisscrossed with many waterfalls, red with drying bracken & the colouring of the trees is magnificent.\n","289":"\n\nAnother fine day & drive to Ambleside on Windermere via Thirlmere, Grasmere & Rydal waters. Grasmere is very pretty indeed & one gets a view of Wordsworth’s Cottage & Seat. Thirlmere is now the source of water supply for Manchester, but the Lake is not all spoilt. The drive is very fine past Helvellyn, but not as much ","290":"\n as yesterdays’.\n","291":"\n\nIn London in the thickest fog I have yet been in. Shopping etc. all day. Dinner at troc. & to the \"Maid of the Mountains\" in the evening. Return to France to-morrow.\n","292":"\n\nLeave Victoria St. at 9 a.m. & cross to Calais from Dover.

Glorious weather just now & the colourings in the trees along the river & elsewhere are very fine indeed.\n","302":"\n","303":"\n","304":"\n\nAt Pont Remy. Nothing of importance.\n\nNotes of October\n\nJust here it is as well to note that there is a peculiar disease flourishing throughout all Europe & has been for months past. It is a severe influenza, or in French, \"Grippe Espagnol\". It is more than influenza but how much more the medical men cannot say.\n\nEngland, France, Germany & Spain have been very severely afflicted & the troops are also suffering from the epidemic. The % of mortality is very high & American soldiers arriving in England are liable to it. This month the Educational Scheme has become part of the daily routine of the Ambulance.\n","305":"\n\nNews of the capitulation of Turkey as from noon","306":" Toussaint. All Pont Remy & in fact France is out to-day in its best, to honour by a church service the dead.\n\nSaturday 2 November\n\nNews of the armistice between Austria & Italy. We are to move shortly & go up to the line, which news is a shock to me.\n","307":"\n\nStill at Pont Remy, but I think we move up to the line on Wednesday. Rumours of an armistice with Germany are current.\n","308":"\n\nThe funniest night for years. Rumour hath it that a French town crier has said, officially, that an armistice has been signed with Germany. All the village, soldiers & civilians are rejoicing, but I think prematurely. However, I have had a glass of wine with my Parisienne for the occasion. We move to-morrow. O Ye Gods!!!! if it is only true!!!\n","309":"\n\nMove cancelled & we move to-morrow, our final de-training station being Epehy, just west of le Catelet. We entrain at Hangest. Absolutely nothing in yesterday’s rumours which were getting a good hold in Pont Remy. Wet to-day.\n","310":"\n\nWet again & prospects looked rotten for a move. However, after having packed & even fallen in one parade, an order came, say no movement of troops is to take place to-day. Postponed for at least 24 hours. Good news from the front, the Germans retreating \nfor\n on a 70 mile front.\n","311":"\n\nAfter three parades to-day, much to the amusement of the villagers, we finally moved by march route to Villers-sous-Ailly, six or seven miles, where we are now billeted in a huge barn. Oh, we miss our beds of Pont Remy. Peace is in sight!! German delegates have crossed line to confer with Foch on armistice terms.\n","312":"\n\nMarch from Villers to Hangest where we entrain & move off en route to Epehy, just north of Roisel.\n","313":"\n\nYe Gods! we have only reached Epehy this evening after thirty hours to do 90 miles. In fact one stop lasted at Roisel for 7 hours. Epeny is of course just West of the Hindenburg System & the country is devastated.\n","314":"\n\nMove from Epeny to Baseul, on the le Cateau-Landrecies Road, about three kilos East of le Cateau. Move by bus, most interesting, over the old Hindenburg System of defences, where barely a wall stands, till we came to a country of green crops and civilians, who were liberated from the Germans in the recent advance. Le Cateau is a fair sized town indeed but badly smashed about, and there are still civilians there, as also in this village.\n\nBut where is the war? Here even, we cannot hear a gun or see a flash & we are twenty miles East of Cambrai. Personally I think the Boshes have bolted!! News from H.Q. says Kaiser has evacuated & Socialists are in power in Germany.\n","315":"\n\nAt 11 a.m. this morning, 72 hours given to German delegates to sign armistice expires. I wonder what will be the news to-day in view of yesterday’s news. The day we have been looking for for years has come and hostilities cease at 11 a.m. to-day on the whole western front. A walk round the country to Ors & Catillon, where there are civilians still living, though very poor indeed. The shelling round some of the villages has been severe, & where the civies got while it was on I don’t know. We, the 1st Division, are to represent the Aust. Corps in the march through liberated Belgium, following the Boshe back to his own country. It takes some believing but is nevertheless official.\n","316":"\n\nAt Bazeul on the le Cateau-Maubeuge Road. We are moving to-morrow, moving back & rumours are rife that we are en route for Marseilles & thence to Turkey.\n","317":"\n\nEarly this morning we moved, back to Busigny, a march of nine miles or so. En route, we passed 4th Army H.Q. & while passing General Rawlinson came and had a few words with us. He told us that we were going to Busigny area until the railway was repaired to Germany & then we were to go on to Coblenz, on the Rhine!!! What joyous news.\n\nNew lands to discover & new people to see. Of course, yesterday’s rumours dispelled..\n","318":"\n\nAt Busigny enjoying glorious weather & not much work. A big Aust. mail in to-day.\n","319":"\n\nStill at Bussigny. We are liable to move at any time to the Frontier, but I think that we will have to go on foot. We are having glorious weather & the moonlit nights are no longer feared for fear of visits of enemy ‘planes. We saw a very fine show to-night, the \"Pedlars\" & it is the best we have seen in France.\n","320":"\n\nA walk to Maretz & a look over several of the ‘dromes in the vicinity.\n","321":"\n\nCensorship regs. have to a certain extent been relaxed & cameras are now allowed to be carried.\n","322":"\n\nFearfully cold to-day and our first glimpse of snow. Very little however.\n\nAnother evening at the Pedlars who are very good indeed. Great preparations are being made for this march to Germany.\n","323":"\n\nNothing doing, still at Busigny, where it is very cold.\n","324":"\n\nVery busy to-day in anticipation of moving to-morrow, the beginning of our march to Germany. Very foggy & cold.\n","325":"\n\nBeautiful day & at 9.30 we began our move to Germany, the first stage to Mazinghien about 8 miles being marched to-day. We are now at Mazinghien, a village badly knocked about. Rumours are rife that W.M. Hughes has objected to our going to Germany & that the move is being cancelled & we are going Home at early date.\n","326":"\n\nMove on again about 8 miles to Prisches, a good march on a fine day. We have good billets at Prisches. were a walk to other villages where we were objects of curiosity as Australians had not been seen before. Move on to-morrow again.\n","327":"\n\nMove again to Avesnelles, on the outskirts of Avesnes. The march was good, nine miles and day fine. Avesnes is a rather fine town, & shows little sign of being knocked about, except railway lines. The country here, Nord, is very fine, intense orcharding appears to be main industry. Of course business is not normal. The rumour that we don’t go to Germany, but only to Belgium, still holds.\n","328":"\n\nAt Avesnelles. A walk to Quesnes which has been quite a decent little town with a fine church. This morning some silly coot set fire to an old ammunition train and explosions have been going all day. Move again to-morrow to Solre le Chateau.\n","329":"\n\nMove again to-day to Solre-le-Chateau, which is a decent sized town, about four miles from the Belgian Frontier. The steeple of the Church is rather imposing. Our billets, a one time German hospital are fine, all under one big roof. The march, about eight miles, was on wet roads but we had no rain. We are now in the area, evacuated by the Germans after the signing of the Armistice but even here the railways, cross roads & bridges have all been blown up by mines.\n","330":"\n\nThe country here, Nord, is fine & well forested & everyone seems to have been prosperous before the war.\n","331":"\n\nStill at Solre-le-Chateau. From here I walked to the Belgian Frontier.\n","332":"\n\nStill at Solre where we will remain for yet a few days. Our next stop will be at Charleroi where we will most likely spend Xmas. The church here is of Spanish origin having been built while the Spanish dominated the Netherlands in 14 & 15 centuries.\n","333":"\n","334":"\n\nStill at Solre-le-Chateau.\n","335":"\n\nA walk round the Station & there a scene of desolation & wreckage is to be seen, scarcely imagined. Trucks & railway lines are thrown yards away & it is the greatest bit of destruction I have seen.\n","336":"\n\nFine day & I took advantage of it to run into Muageuge, the great Frontier fort of this district. It is indeed some fortress & the ramparts are very solid indeed. The streets are narrow & the town old fashioned.\n","337":"\n\nTwo lectures to-day, in connection with the A.I.F. education scheme, one by the Bishop Frodgem (?) on Democracy & one by Lieut. Lowe, the Educational Officer on the scheme generally. It is indeed some scheme & all is to be done to fit a man to recommence civil life.\n","338":"\n","339":"\n\nConsidering the time of year we are to-day having glorious weather, fine & clear & quite warm.\n","340":"\n","341":"\n","342":"\n","343":"\n\nJumped at the chance of a run to Charleroi to-day, though a bit wet and we had two punctures, we had a good day. Charleroi is a fine lively place & is going on as in pre-war days. Mining for coal is the great industry of this part of Belgium. The country en route, 36 kilos is fine & well cultivated. The town is en fete bedraped with flags & the people display great curiosity at us Australians thinking we are Americans. A debate to-night was very good. The women with hair cut short – the sign of the Boshe - & the Museum, are rather typical of the Continent.\n","344":"\n","345":"\n\nThough wet, the weather is remarkably warm, considering the time of year.\n\nIn fact we have only had a few days of cold weather as yet.\n","346":"\n\nA trip on duty to Maubeuge in the driving rain was not pleasant.\n","347":"\n\nWe move on the 15th in two stages to the vicinity of Charleroi.\n","348":"\n","349":"\n\nMove this morning at 11 o’clock & arrive at Solre St. Gery this afternoon.\n\nSolre St. Gery is just out of Beaumont & is a very quaint old village. We move on again to-morrow at 8 a.m. The country is fine, undulating & seems to be of great agricultural wealth & well inhabited. We are now out of France & in Belgium which is a different Belgium to Ypres!!\n","350":"\n\nMove again to-day to Gourdinne on a very circuitous route via Walcourt, which is a decent small town. Wet. The country we are passing through is magnificent & very fertile & closely inhabited & cultivated.\n","351":"\n\nMove again to-day to our destination, Chateau Toussaint Gougnies which is on a high hill, commanding good views of surrounding country. The building is horribly cold and bleak & to-morrow we are to open an hospital just down the road. Weather rotten, cold, windy & wet.\n\nWednesday 18 December\n\nAt Hospital, where we have established a decent rest station but we are miles from Charleroi or any place of any size. The people here are wonderfully generous & will give us anything. I have a small room & bed with sheets, etc. Weather still keeps cold, wet & very windy & is miserable. We are now in the area of the atrocities of 1914. In Dinant 1000 civilians were shot, 500 in another small town nearby & even in this small village 8 were killed. This was a big battle area in","352":"\n","353":"\n\nA walk to Mettet about four to five kilos away. The town is a decent small place & in the square are parked many Boshe guns.\n","354":"\n","355":"\n\nRotten weather, cold, windy & wet & there is not much to do in these parts.\n","356":"\n\nAnother visit to Charleroi, about 17 kilos away, partly walking, then on a Belgians cart & thence by tram. The City on Sunday is very gay indeed & the streets thronged with people. Cafes, Cabarets & Picture houses in full swing & one, the Trianon café & picture house, is very good & typically continental.\n\nPlace brilliantly lighted at night.\n\nHowever, coming home in the dark, wet, & windy, night getting very wet, partly a pied, & partly à cheval, was not too brilliant.\n","357":"\n","358":"\n","359":"\n\nXmas day passed quietly. We had much to eat & a little to drink, but everything was very orderly. As a matter of act, I have a touch of flu.\n","360":"\n\nJoy! A return has been asked of all men who left Australia in 1915 & C.O.’s have been warned to be prepared to lose these men at any moment. Admitted to Rest Station with flu.\n","361":"\n\nMost rotten weather, raining, windy & cold.\n","362":"\n\nIt is very possible that we 1915 men will be enroute for home by the end of the next month.\n\nSome men left to-day, up to the end of June.\n","363":"\n","364":"\n\nDischarged from Rest Station.\n\nStill rotten weather. \"Prince of Wales\" in the vicinity dishing out M.M.’s to the troops.\n\nNothing doing at all. Dreary weather still continues. I am going to the Field of Waterloo to-morrow.\n\nRumours of return of all 1915 men next month are still running strong & they seem to be on good grounds too.\n\n"}}
