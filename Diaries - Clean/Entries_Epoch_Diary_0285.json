\n\n","1":" Sydney NSW\n\nAfter a great deal of hesitation I decided to volunteer for Active Service, in the war against Germany and Austria. I had gone up to Victoria Barracks twice previously, but had turned away for reasons all my own, before finally submiting myself for Medical Examination.\n\nToday passed the Medical Test and became attached to the Australian Army Medical Corps. After having taken the oath, I was told to report back on the Monday following.\n","2":"\n\nReported at the Barracks. Supplied with a suit of dungarees and a white sun-hat. Marched out to the parade ground, dressed in the above, and put through some elementary drill.\n\nOur sleeping quarters were in the large drill hall at the barracks. There we stayed for a fortnight. We were very fortunate with regard to our kit. We were provided with everything essential to Active Service conditions, three days after joining up.\n\nAfter a fortnight’s stay in the baracks, a week of which I spent going to the Sydney Hospital for training, we went into Camp at Queen’s Park, Waverley as No 2 Australian General Hospital. It was a splendid camp and was more like a week-end camp for pleasure purposes than military purposes.\n\nThe work there was of a routine \n\nnature. The day’s work usually consisting of, Reveilie, 5.30, Parade 6.30, barefooted for physical exeercise, usually doubling round the Centennial Park, or, as a change, a little fatigue work picking up waste paper etc. in the vicinity of the camp.\n\nDid fatigue work in the Officer’s mess for one week; 8 o’clock breakfast, which consisted of coffee, bread and jam with a chop or steak, which was eatable sometimes; 9.30 parade for stretches drill, 11.30 lecture, 1 o’clock dinner consisting of mutton, potatoes, vegetables and tea; 2.30 stretcher drill or tent pitching, 3.30 lecture, and as a change we were marched down to Bronte or to Coogee Beach for surf-bathing, which was delightful; 5 o’clock tea, which usually consisted of bread, jam and tea.\n\nThis formed the usual routine of camp life at Queen’s Park, with an occasional night’s picket duty. If we were attending hospital for training, we were free of all other duties.\n\nIt was very amusing to hear all the rumours that floated about regarding our departure to the Front. I had given up listening to these remours as they proved so very often imaginary stories. After the sinking of the German Raider \"Emden\" by the H.M.A.S. Sydney, things took a more definite turn, and the much discussed and long desired date was made known to \n\nus.\n","3":"\n\nThe S.S. \"Kyarra\" arrived in Sydney Harbour. We were busy to-day getting our gear on to the ship.\n","4":"\n\nDuring the time we were in camp we were inoculated against Typhoid twice, and also vacinated once against smallpox.\n\nAfter having scrupluously cleaned the camp, we left in train cars in the afternoon, getting of at the Orient Whaarf. We were formed into messes of fourteen in number and then marched on to the ship.\n\nThere was a large number of people on the Quay, mostly ladies in gay attire. It formed a very animated scene to see the Karki-clad soldiers on the ship holding many coloured streamers on the one side and the ladies holding them at the other. We were well photographed by newspaper Photographers.\n\nAbout 4 o’clock the gangway was lifted and the \"Kyarra\" slowly moved off from the quay.\n\nThe thought that occurred to me as we moved off was, \"how many of us were likely to return\"? Would we all return or would there be many left behind.\n\nAfter bidding W. Izalt farewell and requesting him to send a telegram to George for me stating I had left, I made my way down so as to become acquainted with our quarters of the ship.\n","5":"\n\nSlept in a hammock. Rose feeling\n\nthat there was something the matter with me. I soon realised that sea sickness had me in its grip. Had a few hours respite from it during the day, engaged in baggage carrying, thinking by this means to work of any liklihood of an attack of sickness again. All to no avail for I was barely done with that work when a more severe attack of sickness took hold of me. I got down below to our sleeping quarters and I felt so miserable and wretched that I could not fix up my hammock properly. A mate, the name of Middleton, assisted me to fix up the hammock. After it was fixed up we discovered that the hammock belonged to him and not to me and he was just about as helpless as myself with sea-sickness. \n\nHe took pity on me however, and assisting me into the hammock he quitely went below the table and slept there all night.\n","6":"\n\nArose feeling much better, on duty as mess orderly. Received a letter from home which stated George Stevenson had been killed in France. Wrote a few letters home. Late in the evening we passed the \"heads\" near Melbourne. Slept up on deck this evening. There was a very strong breeze blowing but we were fortunate in having plenty of blankets.\n","7":"\n\nWhen we awoke in the morning we had anchored near Port Melbourne.\n\nAt 8 o’clock we gradually moved up the river Yarra Yarra.\n\nWhen we got into the Quay a very amusing thing happened. A number of people had congregated, apparently anxious to see friends who were aboard. As the ship slowly moved into the quay these people made to get near the ship but all to no avail. They were stopped by the picket at the point of the bayonet. I noticed the picket were dressed in kilts. Even at the point of the bayonet, they tried to pass but the pickets were obstinate and the look of chagrin on the people and the merriment of the soldiers aboard were a peculiar contrast. \n\nThe members of the units from South Aust – and Victoria arrived on board. All is hubbub amongst them in getting their gear abroard.\n\nIn the afternoon we had leave from 2 o’clock till 12 midnight. Had to return to ship at 6 o’clock owing to having been picked for guard.\n\nMaking the most of the time we had in hand, we strolled along the principle streets of Melbourne. The streets of Melbourne are much wider than those of Sydney and they show off the large buildings to advantage and give the city a fine appearance.\n\nWe went into the Railway Station and bought a \"Sydney Telegraph\" for the previous day. On opening the newspaper we found a couple \n\nof large photographs, the \"Kyalla\" at the Orient Wharf and also as it sailed out of the harbour.\n\nGot back in time to go on guard. Full pack up and marched to the guard room there to remain for 24 hours.\n","8":"\n\nA quiet day. Presbyterian Service was held on the Wharf and was attended by Sisters and by men.\n","9":"\n\nRelieved from guard. After a good deal of manoeuvering in order to avoid being put on fatigue work by the N.C.O. we managed to get leave. This we were justly entitled to. A few of us were marched to the city and dismissed to go our own way. .\n\nAfter parading the streets for a short time we boarded the car for St. Kilda. This is a splendid run. We returned by another route. On our way back a (four) lady, I expect attracted by us being dressed in uniform got into conversation with us. She showed us a walking stick which she said had been made out of a piece of wood of Nelson’s ship. It also had a band near the handle with a figure of Nelson on it. She was a French lady and and she gave us an invitation to visit her as she had a large number of curios there. We could not accept the invitation, however.\n\nWe had dinner in Sargents’ and then went out with one of our party to a suburb called \n\nRichmond. In the evening we went to the \"Tivoli\". It was a provoking entertainment. Arrived back to the ship about 12 o’clock.\n","10":"\n\nDoing fatigue work on the wharf shifting stores. Got leave at 5 o’clock. There is not any hope of getting either on or off the ship without a pass. The bayonet is fixed and pointed at everyone, officer and private alike until the pass is examined.\n\nWent to the \"Royal Theatre\". The piece which was entitled the \"Yellow Ticket\" was a play of very great power.\n","11":" W.\n\nParaded for kit inspection. Had leave from about 1 o\\clock. Walked along the banks of the Yarra Yarra for a bit.\n\nVisited the Aquarium and spent a most interesting time there. There are many fine exhibits there and entertainments were going on at various places during the day.\n","12":"\n\nFatigue work scrubbing and polishing in the Hospital on board the ship. Later, down the hold shifting tins full of biscuits. The place was dark and there was very little room to work. We had to double ourselves up to work. We were out of sight of the N.C.O,’s so had some jolly good fun.\n","13":" F.\n\nPut on to the Sanitary Squad for a week along with four others \n\nto look after the sanitary arrangements of the ship. Each unit to take a turn at this work.\n\nIssued with Rubber Shoes and old leather belts.\n\nNotice to the effect tha the \"Kyarra\" is to sail the next day, Saturday 2 o’clock.\n\nGot leave and went into Melbourne for a final visit. We went to see the comedy \"The Girl in the Taxi\" and enjoyed it immensely.\n","14":"\n\nEarly this moring the P.O. came down to our sleeping quarters and found a large number of the men in hammocks after Reveilie\" had sounded, half an hour previously.\n\nHe went upstairs in a rage and ordered the bugler to sound the \"fall In\". The result was a large number failed to put in an appearance. Those who turned up were taken out for a march. Those who did not turn up were paraded before the O.G. and given a word of comfort.\n\nSome of them discovered that they were put on extra picket, later, and put it down as a punishment for being late. After dinner we paraded in full dress. Marched to the Royal Park and treated to drinks by the Officers. Got back to the ship about 5 o’clock and found a large number of people waiting to see the ship go out.\n\nMoved off from the wharf at a quarter past six. The send off was partially spoilt owing to the people being kept off the wharf. \n\nuntil the gainway was raised. Cinemtograph operators were present. \n\nI enjoyed my time in Melbourne very well. I like the kind of people there. They to my mind are very like the people of the Old Country.\n\nReceived a letter from George this evening.\n","15":"\n\nRose this morning feeling very sick. Lay on deck nearly all day. Attempted to take any food at meal time. No sooner had I partaken of any food, than I had to make a bee-line upstairs and empty it over the side of the ship again.\n","16":" M.\n\nA repetition of the previous day.\n","17":"\n\nFeeling in splendid form this morning. S.F. then a lecture by one of the M.O.s.\n\nSpent the remainder of my time reading, \"The Magic of Love\" by Annie Swan. A very stiring story. Everyone seems to have recovered from there sea-sickness. Entertaining times are given by amateur musicians of which there are a few and good sport is also given by boxing bouts amongst the men. At least the onlookers enjoy it.\n","18":"\n\nPhysical drill on deck 6.30 this moring. S.F. lecture 2 o’clock. Speculations as to the time we are likely to arrive in Fremantle. The general opinion is Friday night.\n","19":"\n\nFeeling well, mess orderly today. Instruction in Fire Drill and Accidents to the ship. Lecture 2.30. Pay of one shilling per day. Remainder at the end of the voyage.\n\nSighted land about 1 o’clock today. For the last 24 hours we travelled 295 miles. At 12 o’clock we were 396 miles from Fremantle. Finished reading \"A Human Face\" by Silas Hocking. A splendid story. Wrote a letter to G. this evening. A rollicking entertainment was given this morning by two sets of four boxers. They boxed blindfolded. Roars of laughter emanated from the onlookers at the antics of the boxers. Some of the onlookers came in for a few blows unexpectedly.\n","20":" F.\n\nWrote a letter home in order to catch the mail at Fremantle.\n\nRain fell all day.\n\nArrived at Fremantle about 9 o’clock this evening. A beautiful starry night. Ship attached to a buoy in the harbour. It was fine to see the lights flickering in the darkness as we neared the town.\n","21":"\n\nBeautiful morning. The \"Kyarra\" is being coaled from both sides of the ship as we stand in the middle of the harbour.\n\nLeave only granted if in charge of N.C.O. Got leave at 4 o’clock. Took train from Fremantle to Perth, a distance of about 12 miles. Took 40 minutes to travel that distance. Had a walk around town\n\nwith T. After having tea we walked up to the Kings Park. The Park is situated very high up. We got a splendid view of the city of Perth and also of the Swan River. It was one of the finest sights I have ever seen. The Park covers a few miles of ground. There are beautiful drives in the park and a thing that enchances this appearance is the Red stones which is sprinkled over the surface of the road. There were a few beautiful monuments there also. One was in memory of a Governor of W.A., a statue to Queen Victoria, a momument to W.A. men who had been killed in the South African War, bronze tablets on the sides of it depicted scenes that happened during the war. We passed by the Observatory on our way back to town. We also passed a statue to one of the early explorers name Forest. The commemoration tablet was so obliterated that we could not learn the exact nature of the deeds done by him. Strolling along the streets again we made for the station arriving there not a moment too soon in order to catch the 9.30 train. \n\nWe had to wait on the wharf till the N.C.O. in charge of our party came back. Rain came down while we were waiting and we got thoroughly drenched before he arrived on board.\n","22":"\n\nAttended the St. John’s Episcopal Church this morning. The Archbishop of Perth was the preacher. Sailors \n\non the one side of the aisle and Sisters and A.M.C. on the other made a very pretty scene.\n\nHad leave at 1 o’clock. Meant to spend the day in Fremantle but meeting in with Stillman we took train for Perth.\n\nWent into Perth Museum. It is one of the finest places of the kind that I have been in, it is a place of real educational value. One outstanding thing that made it so, was the manner in which the exhibits were placed. Instead of the birds or animals being placed in plain cases, they were place in natural surroundings. I saw the full value of this manner of doing things when I looked at the case of birds of my own native country. They seemed very real and lifelike. Went into the baths and had a swim. Took train to Queens Park, and then back again, out to Subiaco. I had a good conception of the size of the Kings Park as it extended out as far as this place. Left Perth at 9 o’clock having spent a very pleasant time.\n","23":"\n\nS.F. Paraded infull dress on the wharf after dinner. Inspected by the Governor of W.A. He talked freely with the men who wore colours for other wars on their heart.\n\nIt was very uncertain whether we would leave Fremantle today or no. Large crowds of people were waiting at the wharf. A\n\nfew of the stokers of the ship had gone off and got drunk. The Captain and other officers of the ship went out to look for them in motor cars. We saw a few of them being brought up the gangway in a more or less helpless condition. They were all brought back but one. A man of the sailor class was standing on the wharf with a few others. As the officer was about to pass him a few words passed between them and they both got into the motor car. The car hurried away and about ten minutes after returned with the new stoker carrying his kit bag. This scene greatly amused the onlookers who gave him a hearty cheer as he mounted the gangway.\n\nAbout 7 o’clock the gangway was raised and we slowly moved away from the pier. There was a large crowd, we got a splendid send off and amidst great enthusiasm we sailed away.\n\nThe comment of the troops on board was that we had seen the last of Aust – for some time at least. Tonight is beautiful.\n","24":" M.O. to G.\n\nThe ship sails with a bit list all to the one side which is not very safe looking. It is also rolling considerably. It is like walking a greasy pole at times getting along the deck. \n\nHave read the \"Tale of Two Cities\" by Charles Dicken. Thoroughly delighted with the story.\n\nA meeting of the men in order to form a Sports Committee tonight \n","25":"\n\nNo Fatigue Duty today. A concert on the Promenade deck tonight. Programme of the sports to be held on Saturday afternoon is up on orders. Boxing, Fencing, Crickets, Egg & Spoon, Potatoe race, Wheel Barrel Race, Chalking the Line.\n","26":"\n\nNo water to wash ourselves with this moring.\n\nM.O. & I scrubbing down stairs. Lecture 4 o’clock.\n\nA Free and Easy concert held by the Tasmanian Unit on deck. Good musical talents amongst them. The chairman had an amusing manner of intimating the various items. He intimated the name of the song, the singer’s name and also the nick name he is known by amongst his mates. Instances of the humerous nick names were, the \"Fatigue Dodger\", the \"Greasy Corporal\" etc.\n","27":" Phy D. 7 am.\n\nWe are having beautiful weather just now.\n\nA lantern lecture was to be held tonight. Owing to the failure of the apperatus to work the lecture was posponed. \n\nDistance travelled today 290 miles.\n","28":"\n\nLarge numbers of \"flying fish\" are flying about. They look very pretty.\n\nTravelled 270 miles today.\n","29":"\n\nDivine Service 11 am.\n\nEnjoyed the service very well.\n\nA Methodist Chaplain gave the address. The advice was simple and very hearty. Pass the Cocos Island at 12 o’clock today. It was near these islands that H.M.A.S. Sydney sank the German Raider \"Emden\".\n\nThese last few days have been exceedingly hot. There is a very sweaty smell about the troop deck. The lightest attire is being worn by the men. In spite of that fact still the perspiration comes pouring out of us.\n\nThe \"flying Fish\" about here seem to be much larger than the ones we previously have seen. On guard tonight. The nights are very cool and refreshing on deck. Down below where the troops sleep it is very, very hot.\n","30":"\n\nWhen I was in these parts earlier in the year it was very cold. This time the weather is hot.\n\nA notice is posted up to the office that \"Father Neptune and his team\" are to pay us a visit on Thursday at 2.30 in order to meet with new acquantance and to see old friends.\n\nTravelled 233 miles today.\n\nLantern lecture by Col. Nash tonight. XRay slides showing the circulatory apperatus was very instructive to us.\n","31":" M.O.\n\nRead \"The Resurrection\" by Tolstoi. A splendid story treating of a very delicate subject.\n\nConcert tonight.\n","32":" Phy. D.\n\nKit inspection on the boat deck. At the request of the men, instead of meat being issued to us at every meal a supply of jam is to be given instead. \n\nSports today for the men. Had a headache which prevented me from taking any great interest in the sports.\n\nA heavy wave came in through the port hole damaging a great deal of music which was lying on the table. A couple of wind sheets clashed on the floor also.\n","33":"\n\nParaded along with thirty others to explain why I had lost two shirts. Explained that I had washed them, hung out to dry and they were \"pinched\" (stolen).\n\nFather Neptune with his wife and train came on board the \"Kyarra\" at 2.30 this afternoon on the occasion of the \"Kyarra\" crossing the \"line\". They were all dressed up in grotesque fashion.\n\nThe new acquaintenance, that is, those who had not previously crossed the equator were introduced to \"Father Neptune\" and his lady. After the introduction ceremony the doctor took the temperature of the new acquaintance with a large wooden thermometor. According to his supposed temperature he was either treated to a dose of cold water or a dose of medicine. To all appearances the medicine was like spirits. The dose was no sooner partaken off then it was \n\nspued up again and the grimace of the patient showed it was not \"Real Mountain Dew\". It consisted of salt and water.\n\nThey were then put into the hands of the barber. Soaping them with tar they were shaved with a large wooden razor. Then suddenly the barbers assistants lifted him off the chair and threw him head first into a large canvas bath full of water. Sometimes the patient resisted and in the struggle pulled the assistants with them, causing roars of laughter. After the ceremony some of the Officers and Sisters threw apples and oranges into the bath. Large numbers of the men made to get these apples and oranges with the result that the canvas bath collapsed under the strain and the water flooded all over the deck. It was a splendid afternoons sport.\n","34":"\n\nF.D. Service held, being on Duty I was not present. Duck and Plum Pudding for dinner today, cigarettes and pipe issued 100 miles south of Colombo at 12 o’clock today. Little books issued by the Y.M.C.A. very interesting.\n\nA sign that we are reaching a port is the fact that large numbers of the troops are busy writing letters.\n","35":"\n\nSighted land today at 2 o’clock \n\nIt is fine to sight land after being a number of days away from it. Any rumour to the effect that land is in sight causes a great flutter of excitment and binoculars are produced. We were sailing into harbour just as the sun was setting. Away on the horizon we could see a ship outlined against the setting sun and it made an enchanting scene.\n\nIf there had been nothing else the yap, yap of the native boatmen who came along side the ship would have told us that we were in a foreign port.\n\nWe had not been in port more than a few minutes before the natives began to beg money etc. from us. \n\nNewspapers of the 24th Dec. were being sold by natives on board the ship at 6p each. They contained startling news to us. One of the reports was that a raid had been made on England by the German Navy. Scarborough, Whitby and Hartlepool being the affected towns.\n\nFelt quite lost owing to the lack of authentic news of the war.\n","36":"\n\nHad leave to go over to Colombo. This we did in small boats rowed by natives.\n\nWent to the British India Hotel and had some light refreshments. We drove around the principal \n\nsights of the city. A few of the places we visited were the Victoria Gardens, Museum, a Buddist Temple, the Barracks, the native quarters, and on our way round we passed various bungalow buildings which were said to be clubs of the well-to-do. The sight that interested me most in my visit to Colombo was the native quarters. They are a strange medley of human nature, these people who live their. To see them in their little tumble-down shops or rather recesses open to the street and having for sale all kinds of unknown stuffs for food etc. was to our eyes very funny and very interesting. The buildings of the whole place had rather a dilappidated appearance. This applies to the native temples also.\n\nThe idea amongst the native priests seems to be to extract money from you, and all manner of dodges to this end are made. You have to take off your boots outside the door of the temple, a little boy will look after them for you, if you pay him. Another will do the same with your hat. There are various boxes for offerings and the priest is up to his work in getting the money out of you for these charities. Long practise with this faculty makes them experts at the game.\n\nHaving driven round this route when I was here a little over six months ago I knew there were some other places \n\nof interest to see. The driver refused to drive us the stipulated round. The same idea again, \"more money wanted\". On our threat to report him to the police he drove on. An extra sixpence on the way seemed to please him and he gave us an extra long drive.\n\nHad dinner in B.I.H. Had a walk through the principal streets. One had not much peace in walking along these thoroughfares. We were continually pestered with natives calling to us, walking along side of us and all but carried into the shops by them. \n\nOnce in the shop it is not the lack of a persuasive manner on the part of the salesman if you \n\ncome out of the shop without.buying anthing. They have a delightful manner with them. Bought two little ivory elephants charms.\n\nAs we walked along the streets during the afternoon wondering where we should go to next, we saw our cabman of the forenoon drive, eyeing us up and down.\n\nHe was lame and he hobbled over to us. He asked us in broken English to go with him to a Hindostan Temple, which was a good drive, so he said. \n\n\"How much\" was the inevitable query from us. \"Four shillings\" he said. After a deal of bargaining we managed to bring the fare down to two shillings which we agreed to.\n\nIt was a building situated in one of the most tumble down districts I had ever visited. The building was covered with images, but the figures were in the most filthy and disreputable condition imaginable.\n\nThey would not allow us to enter the Temple. The people seem to live in awe of their religion.\n\nDismissing our cabman in the middle of this quarter we took a walk along the narrow streets, the of all eyes, and followed by a very large number of youngsters.\n\nAs we went on our way in this manner we heard a tremendous noise like that of a rowdy band banging with might and main on tin cans. Going along to where the noise was being made, and this was easily found by means of a large crowd of people in the middle of the street, we found the reason for this unearthly turmoil to be a native band. They were playing on very crudely made instruments which seemed to be as old as the hills. They could make a noise all night, but where the music came in I do not know.\n\nThis second visit to Colombo was very interesting and instructive. These narrow streets were simply teeming with black people. Where and how they exist one can only wonder.\n\nHaving had tea in the Arcade we then made our way to the pier. We sailed over to the \"Kyerra\" which \n\nlay a good way out and we just arrived at the gangway in time to escape a heavy shower of rain.\n\nOthers, who had left the pier a few minutes later had unpleasant experiences to themselves, but the onlookers had the time of their lives seeing the unfortunates coming aboard.\n\nTheir are some reckless men in our unit. One party upset their boat as they were about to step on the gangway. Luckily they all escaped with only a drenching in the water. How the native got on with his water-logged boat I do not know.\n\nS.H.G. to-night.\n","37":"\n\nCorrespondence home etc. Natives are busy round about the ship selling fruit, coconuts etc. and they are doing a roaring trade. They are very keen business men these natives fruitsellers. It takes a smart man to beat them.\n\nIt is glorious to stand and lean over the ship’s rail at night time. This night is very clear, the moon is shining brightly and appears to be straight above our heads.\n\nNatives are busily engaged loading the ship with coal and filling its tanks with water. These natives here do not work as hard or make so much noise as those who fill the coal bunkers at Port Said.\n\nI notice that amongst those who had never seen a foreign shore before this time, talk very loundly on how they dealt with the native when he bought anything. Probably the native got the best of the bargain after all is said and done.\n\nThere are a very large number of jack-daws, both in the streets of Colombo and also in the harbour.\n","38":"\n\nHad a few hours ashore this forenoon. Warned that all parties were to be aboard at 2 o’clock.\n\nI had a very pleasant walk through the streets again. Brt. a few precious stones (?) moonstones are very lucky, so the native said from whom I brt. them. Brt. a copy of English Songs and Ballads from one of the biggest booksellers shops here. Strange to say a portrait of \"Robbie Burns\" graced the frontispiece. A nurse was taken aboard the ship on a stretcher suffering from sunstroke.\n\nGoing over to Colombo in a small boat was a most hair-raising experience. There was a fair breeze blowing and coupled with the unskilfulness of the boatsmen I really thought every minute we were going to be upset.\n\nWe had a slightly better experience on our return journey but I never felt safe until I set foot on board the ship again.\n\nThis instance of the natives begging nature will help to illustrate the dodges they get up to. I happened to wash a few clothes and having dried them in the sun was taking them down when one of a number of natives who were loading bags of potatoes on to the ship came over to me and asked me for one of the articles. I refused him, however. Two hours later when I had almost forgotten the above incident he came over to me again. He chatted away in a humerous fashion in broken English for some time, then made reference to the clothes again. He said \"that thing would do him\". I retorted with \"that thing would also do me\". \"Ah! he says \"You go to London, you get plenty clothes\". Instances of this kind are always cropping up.\n\n(Travelled 267 miles). We left Colombo Harbour at 8 pm. Two searchlights kept sweeping the seas as we sailed out. At times they were fixed on our ship and lighted the deck up beautifully.\n","39":" Phy Ex & Kit Inspection.\n","40":" M.O.\n\nPassed the Laccadives Islands. According to the atlas they are a group of fourteen islands and have a population of 14,000. We were not very near them however, and to us they appeared to be only a mere outline except at the point of one there appeared to be a building which we took to be a lighthouse.\n\nThis being Hogmarney I was reflecting to-night where I was a year ago.\n\nI remember along with J. & B taking a walk up to the Steeple at home about midnight. To-night J is in Portland, B is in France and I am on the High Seas. \n\nDec. In spite of the fact that we were on a crowded ship and far out to sea, the \"boys\" determined to pass it in the old, old way. Some of them got basins, pails, etc. from, they only, know where and marching up and down banging at the things causing a terrible row and endeavouring to sing some of the popular songs above the noise. The noise they made just about excelled the noise of the native band in the streets of Colombo. It was pandermonium itself for an hour or two. \n\nThe officers and sisters had a fancy dress ball to-night amongst them-selves.\n","41":"\n\n\"A Happy New Year\" was the first words of the boys on awakening this morning.\n\nA \"Daily Paper\" is being published by some humorous members of the units. The Humorous and Sarcastic news, published in the paper, are splendid. It is a type-written and posted up for all to read.\n\nThere was a scarcity of water in the men’s Shower Baths. The complaint was report to O.O. and remedied.\n\nA paragraph to this effect was put in the paper as follows\n\nMeteorological Survey:- showery this morning in the \n\nShower Bath.\n","42":" Phy Ex. G.\n\nMess arrangements for the Guard not very good. There are twenty four of us. Seated on the deck, diving into the food as best we can, we look more like poultry feeding than men. It is a case of each one peck for himself with the consequent appearance of a rabble. \n\nOne of the units had sports this afternoon. Great fun was caused by the pillow fight. The large canvas bath was half filled with water. A long thick pole was hung over it. This pole was made as slippery as possible by means of soft soap. On this the combatants had to sit facing one another each having a well filled pillow in his hand with which he had to knock his opponent over into the water. There was some fine sport created by this means.\n\n263 miles to-day.\n\nThe Officers had a competition in ships hockey this afternoon.\n","43":"\n\nBad chops were issued for our breakfast this morning. The smell was something awful. Nearly every mess complained about them.\n\nA burial service was held over some of it. These mess tins were carried in front and the boys marched up to the deck groaning as they went. One of the men gave a short address and another played the dead march in . After these ceremonies had been conducted \n\nin mock fashion D.W. the bugler sounded the \"last Post\" and amid groans from the men the chops were consigned to the deep. \n\nRead English Songs & Ballads.\n\n270 miles to-day.\n\nChurch Parade, a Bright Service. Had a ration of \"lime juice\".\n","44":" Phy Ex. F.\n\nF. drawing up boxes of rotten potatoes. The smell from them was something awful and were tipped over the side of the ship.\n\n283 miles today, 572 miles from Aden.\n\nPassed two islands about six o’clock this evening. They rose like sheer masses of rock out of the sea to a great height and looked as level as a table top. Got our photo taken by one of the officers this evening Col. Sp..\n","45":" Phy Ex\n\nThe coast of Africa was in sight when we rose this moring. The dawn breaks about 6 am. Read the \"Kyarra Truth\" this morning. It is becoming too personel and the editors may get into trouble if they are not careful. Met in with a chap from W.A. who previously belonged to Ayrshire. There are quite a number of Scotties on the ship.\n","46":" M.O. F.\n\nParaded in full dress. Arrived at Aden between 3 and 4 in the afternoon. As we sailed up, the place gave me the impression of another Gibraltar. High rocky hills with nothing green growing on them. The sun\n\nsetting behind the hills gave a view almost similar to the sunset behind the Grampians at home.\n\nNews has reached the ship that the H.M.S. Indomitable has gone down in the Mediterrean with 800 lives.\n\nAs I am writing this note an animated discussion is going on round the mess table. The subjects embracing immortality, Religion, the causes of the war, is the Kaiser responsible. Some are also eating bread and cheese and cold patties are also in plenty. We anchored well out from the shore. We had no sooner been anchored than a large number of small boats gathered round. The men in the boats began to sell cigarrettes, Turkish Delight, Ostrich Feathers and other luxuries. They did a roaring trade amongst those who had money to spend. Some of the troops were lamenting the fact that pay day had not arrived. \n\nThere were a number of ships anchored near the shore. \n\nThe question of the hour \"where is our destination\". Left Aden in the evening.\n","47":"\n\nPay day. Received 10\/-.\n\nWe have passed quite a number of ships to-day. One of them was an armoured merchantman said to be the \"Empress of Russia\".\n\nOld Frank Chandler, a Belgian who is with us gave a number of the unit, sisters included, lessons in French. Not a success however.\n","48":" Phy Ex\n\nRead a \"Son of Erin\" by Annie Swan, delighted with the story.

Lawson’s Songs and Humorous Verses. Very Good. Learned from some of the chaps who know him that he is a confirmed drunkcaard.\n\nExperiencing very rough seas just now. We are in the Red Sea. Had a very instructive lecture \"Hygiene on the March\".\n","50":" G.\n\nSighted the Daidalus Lighthouse. It is built on a rock which is hidden by the sea. Three P & O Steamers are said to have been sunk on this hidden rock before the lighthouse was built. The Keepers who were on it; went mad, it is so lonely. To obviate this a jetty was built so that the Keepers would be able to take exercises. One could see the jetty, but very indistinctly. Sighted land about dinner time. 275 miles to-day\n\nRead Dr. Johnston and his Circle in M. K. Series. Very interesting. Very stormy all last night. Had to wear my overcoat whilst on guard. Rather a contrast to which I had previously thought and heard of the Red Sea.\n\nWhiled away the weary hours on guard by studying the stars. Saw\n\nthe Plough, Cassiopia, Plieades, Orion, the night was so beautifully clear and starry.\n","51":"\n\nOn going up on deck this morning, I witnessed a very pretty scene as the sun was rising just over the mountains on the Arabian side of the Gulf of Suez. The P & O steamer Malura passed close by us this morning. There is great jubilation amongst the troops as they expect to get letters by the mail which the Malura is carrying to Port Said.\n\nReached Port Suez 8 p.m.\n\nThe Suez Canal.\n\nThe town of Suez lies several miles from the entrance to the canal. A narrow strip of land from the dock forms a road across the lagoon.\n\nAfter making preparations such as fixing the searchlights over the bows of the steamers, etc. we enter the canal, passing the large first station which has a statue of De Lesseps, its famous engineer.\n\nThe sandy desert stretches as far as the eye can reach. It is very peculiar and forms the main characteristic of the scenery along this wonderful and highly interesting engineering feat.\n\nWith a length of 87 miles, 20 yds in width and a depth of 25 ft the canal has 13 signalling stations all connected by telegraph and announcing the coming and going of the various steamers.\n\n \n\nAt these stations, sidings made by widening the canal are placed so that vessels can pass one another. One of the vessels has to moor to the side till the other passes. Ships of War and Mail Boats fly the privilege flag and are allowed to pass first (a white P on a blue ground). Various signals to regulate the traffic are in operation. Speed limit 6 miles per hour.\n\nThe first stage of interest after leaving Suez with Mt. Attaka as a back ground (2700 ft) is the Bitter Lake in which the speed is increased to full beteen the stations Serapeum and Toussoum. \n\nThen Ismailia on Lake Timsah which lies midway of the length of the canal. \n\nA narrow gauge railway runs from Ismailia along the bank to Port Said. A railway also runs to Cairo.\n\nAfter 17 miles of narrow canal and high sandy banks at Kantasah the famous crossing of the caravans and pilgrims to Mecca is passed. (Mecca is about half way down the Red Sea on the Arabian side.) Lake Minzalah with its flamingoes and wild fowl are located on the west side and passengers on ships will often on occasion see a mirage. Cairo has frequently been seen pictured upside down in the air, so also have ships etc.\n\nThe run through the canal takes from 15 to 17 hours.\n","52":"\n\nWe entered the canal at 11am. It appears to me the same this time as the last, namely Fairyland. Before we left, the boatmen were around our ship again with cigarettes, fruits, Turkish delight etc.\n\nWe passed the warship \"Ocean\" as we entered the canal. There is great activity on the banks of the canal. Large numbers of Indian troops placed at intervals along the banks making fortifications.\n\nIt is most amusing to see them standing high up waving their picks and shovels in their hands and shouting \"hurrah\" as we pass. The scene is very picturesque. These Indian troops look very picturesque and very smart in their distinctive dress of light Karki. Large numbers of Egyptian labourers are working along with them. \n","53":"\n\nWe arrived in Port Said very early in the morning. The natives began to coal the ship as soon as we had anchored. A number of warships were in port also, some merchant ships including the City of London, Kaiser I Hind.\n\nWe were allowed to go ashore for a few hours and took full advantage of the opportunity to see as much of the place as possible.\n\nWe took a drive in a cab around the native parts and a tumble down district it was. The stenches emitted \n\nfrom the streets were awful.\n\nWe were bombarded with hawkers selling P.P.C. beads, cheap jewellery and feathers. These things looked attractive in the hands of the hawkers but once in your own possession their value seemed to decrease until ultimately one began to wonder why they had bought such rubbish. To a \"greenhorn\" these natives have a way with them, so persevering, so pursuading that they draw the money out of you in spite of yourself.\n\nMet a Seaforth Highlander walking along the street. I made enquiries at him as to the station of his regiment. He stated the regiment had gone to France and that he had heard they had got a cutting up there. My reason for making the enquiries was to see if John was stationed anywhere near.\n\nThe usual quota of boatmen selling fruits etc. surrounded the ship. There was in addition a boat containing a string band who entertained us with some fine music then asked for a collection.\n\nA youngster of 11 or 12 years of age also entertained us with some marvellous tricks.\n\nWe left Port Said between 5 and 6 p.m.\n","54":"\n\nSailed into Alexandria 8 a.m. Big number of ships in the harbour. A one time Sultan’s Palace stands right in front of the harbour.\n\nEndeavoured to get leave ashore but had no luck in that respect.\n","55":"\n\nGot up early in order to go to Cairo but not having entered my name over night no pass was available. Only a select few get to know of these things, I notice. Cliques which to my mind are disgusting.\n\nHowever, later in the day I got a pass to go to Alexandria and had a glorious time.\n\nI did not go to the native quarters this time but found my way to the European part and considered Alex - to be a fine city.\n\nWe were taken to various places of interest by young men who were students. We spent a very pleasant hour or two walking through the museum. Ancient Egyptian statues, jewelley, minimum 2000 year old etc. were to be seen here.\n\nWe strolled through a beautiful garden in which were the ruins of an ancient castle said to have been built in 108 A.D.\n\nWe had not the annoyance of streetsellers pestering the life out of us to buy, in this city. A fine square is to be found in the centre of the city.\n\nThe sail over to the \"Kyarra\" and vice versa in the small boats was not altogether a pleasure owing to the eratic movements of the boatmen.\n\nThe U.S.A. warship \"Tennecale\" was in the harbour near by us. The streets of Alex – were very busy \n\nwith the passing of A.A.S.C. along them.\n\nTwo lectures given to us by Col Nash on the dangers in the large cities especially Egypt.\n","56":" Pay 10\/-\n\nRain in the forenoon. Went ashore in a small cutter.\n\nWent through a part of the town which was made up of native shops and dwellings. It was a picturesque scene to see these shops all open to the street. Fruitshops, Grocers, Bootmakers, Drapers all with a peculiar air about them which I had not seen previosuly. Every place was open to the public eye and one found it extremely interesting to watch the native blacksmith, cage makers, bootmakers and broom makers at work. We wandered about with no particular aim in view till we reached Ras-el-Tin Palace. In the Barracks some Manchester Territorials are stationed at present. A few of them took us round the barracks and showed us the place. We then made our way along the \nwater \n sea front back to the city. Had dinner in the Soldiers &\n\nSailors Home. Not very much life about that place.\n\nWe took a cab after the usual bargaining on prices. The driver drove us to Pompeii Pillar and we saw Catacombs under it.\n\nPompeii Pillar is a tall pillar of granite and is a fine piece of work. It is said to be 2300 years old. Inset in the stand of the pillar the tomb of Pompeii was pointed out to us. We were then taken underground and there we saw some Roman Catacombs.\n\nHaving seen all that was to be seen here, we were then driven to the Catacombs proper. In seeing them we indeed got a surprise. We walked down steps which were made, spiral like, round a chimney like structure of massive stonework down into the earth. When we reached the bottom of the shaft several places like large rooms of solid masonry were to be seen. In these places the favouite horses were buried, several skulls and bones of horses found there, were exhibited.\n\nBranching off from these rooms were passages about 4 ft wide and 7 ft high which were also of the same massive nature. These passages contained two rows on each side of the individual tombs. Various niches where families were buried and beautifully carved figures of Roman Gods were of great interst. Some remains were still in these tombs.\n\nThese places are lit up by electric light. It is an awe inspiring sight to see these catacombs. There are a great many more\n\nto be opened up but owing to water coming in, it will take some time to do so.\n\nDrove round by the canal back to the city.\n\nWent back to the ship at 4 p.m. Got orders to have our kits packed and ready to disembark.\n","57":" M.O.\n\n\"Kyarra\" went alongside the wharf this morning. Men have been detailed for duty on the Wharf and to unload No. 2 A.G.H. stores from the ship. Kept busy all day unloading.\n","58":"\n\nVery busy unloading still. Had leave in the evening. Strolled along the streets of Alex –\n","59":"\n\nWorking in the sheds, shifting stores.\n","60":"\n\nLeft for Cairo 8 a.m. Heavy mist in the early part of the morning. After the air cleared we were entertained to a very pretty and picturesque scene right along the line. The natives in there native dress, working in the fields, usually in groups was delightful. The natives, riding there donkey in a peculiar fashion, along the banks of the canal. The camels with there slow easy going pace and their masters seated in front of their humps with an occasional outburst in the native tongue and a wack of their stick to make them move faster was very funny. The beautiful green vegetation growing on the very flat land, land which stretched\n\nas far as the eye could see and never seemed to rise above the levee. The native mud built villages and the peculiar cemetaries outside the villages all pictured a scene which was utterly new to us, and all the more interesting in that respect.\n\nArrived in Cairo about 12 mid day. We were put on unload stores. \n\nHad dinner in the Kasr-el-nil Barracks. We loaded the stores on to Tram Cars which took them to Camp hear Mena House Hotel, about seven miles away at the foot of the Great Pyramids.\n\nWe reached camp at 8 p.m.\n","61":"\n\nWent to Cairo to unload stores.\n\nBack in Camp 4 pm.\n","62":"\n\nDetailed for hospital Duty in No. 6 ward.\n","63":"","64":" 24th,","65":" 26th,","66":" No. 6 ward.\n","67":"\n\nReceived a good deal of correspondence. Some of it had gone to Aust – and followed me back to Egypt.\n","68":"\n\nHad the afternoon off duty. Climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid of Ghiza. It is said to have been built by King Cheops 5000 years ago. It was originally 477 ft high but the top part has been taken away which makes it at present 451 ft. high. Built of limestone it is said to cover a base of 13 acres. I had an old Egyptian guide. He held me by the hand and pulled me up step by step.\n\nThe size of the stones varied in most cases from three to four ft square. One got a very good view from the top of the Pyramid. Away on the left was nothing but sand, sand as far as the eye could reach. On the left, the River Nile with the border of beautiful agricultural country and palm trees, was very pretty and a delightful contrast. In front, on the sand, was the camp of the Australian troops in training. About 200 yds from the foot of the Pyramid, Mena House Hotel stands. It is at present the hospital for the camp, namely No. 2 A.G.H.\n\nAway down in the valley about 400 yds from the pyramid, the Mysterious Sphinx is to be seen. It has the head of a man and the body of a lion. It is said to have been worshipped as a god at one time. There is also the view of the Temple of the Sphinx close to it. It is built of marble with an alabaster floor and looked as if it had just been excavated after having been covered with sand.\n\nI was, to a certain extent, disappointed when I saw the Sphinx for the first time. I think after reading accounts I had expected to see something more marvellous. Since then however I have walked round by the Sphinx at various times of the day and evening and every visit seemed to impress me more than the proceeding one. One visit I remember well. It was about eight o’clock int he evening, a beautiful moonlight evening and the stars shining \n\nbrightly. A sight which I dont think that anyone can see unless they go to Egypt to see it. The Sphinx simply fascinated one. The features of the face seemed to me to be almost human, and I would not have been the least surprised, had that massive monument spoken to us, so real and lifelike it seemed to be.\n\nRode back to the Hospital on a camel’s back. A very queer sensation as one rolls along. My sailing experience put me a great deal more at my ease, than otherwise I would have been. \n\nPurchased a few scarrabs and Ancient coins from the natives in order to get rid of them as these natives gather round and one has no peace until they are got rid of by some means or other.\n\nFriday 29th Jan.\n\nTransferred many patients to the Field Hospital.\n\nNews of a scrap with the Turks down on the Suez Canal.

Something wrong in the Canal.\n","72":"","73":" 3rd","74":"\n\nWent into Cairo this afternoon along with other three. We took the tram to the citadel \n\nIt is like Edinburgh Castle, built very high up on a hill, with the second finest mosque in the world built at the top, namely Mohammed City Mosque.\n\nFrom this point we got a splendid view of the city of Cairo and the surrounding country. At our feet lay the city, flat roofed, and covering a wide area. There are said to be 500 mosques in Cairo and to look at the minarets and domes pointing skywards above the flat tops of the houses is a fine change from what one sees in European countries.\n\nTo the left lies old Cairo a conspicuous object there is the Old Roman Acqueduct, which at parts has tumbled down. \n\nAway in the distance on the edge of the desert about ten miles away the Pyramids are to be seen. There are nine pyramids but only three can be seen the others are small and are almost in ruins. On the banks of the River Nile the beautiful green of the land there is delightful.\n\nLeaving the Citabel we went down through the narrow streets and lanes inhabited by the natives. It was very interesting, and I felt as if I could never tire walking through these strange places and new scenes. \n\nOne could see the natives at their various simple industries. There are no windows to these shops which are invariable small and one could see all that was going on.\n\nThe Egyptian women veil their faces\n\nthe forehead and the eyes only being visible. The married women wear black veils and the unmarried wear white. To see a well dressed Egyptian women under these circumstances is very fascinating. Their eyes have a very bewitching appearance, very black, sparkling and penetrating.\n\nWe came to a mosque and curious to see the inside of it we made to go inside. As we were about to step through the doorway we were stopped and requested to put large slippers over our boots before entering. We did as we were requested.\n\nThe floor of the mosques are laid with carpet. The walls are massively built. The roof was beautifully inlaid with ivory, ebony etc.. Beautiful stained glass windows with the colours Red, Yellow, Green and Blue nicely blended gave the place a very rich and also a very refreshing appearance. A niche in the wall of the Mosque is placed facing the East. It is facing this way that the people pray. The reason is that Mecca, their Holy City lies in that direction.\n\nA native boy was at his devotions as we entered.\n\nContinuing our walk along the narrow streets we were attracted by quaint, crude drawings on one of the houses. We learned that these crude drawings showed to all that the inhabitant of that house had visited Mecca and the drawings depicted the \n\nmanner he had travelled there. Painted by an amateurish hand were figures of a house, a train, a rider on a donkey, a rider on a camel and other indescribable figures.\n\nWe finshed the day’s outing by having tea in Groppi’s, the high Class Restaurant of Cairo. Going into to \"Groppi’s\" one has to pick up a plate and small fork and spoon. Armed with these, one picks out the cakes he desires of which there are a very large selection. Taking your plate of cakes to a favourite seat the waiter calls and you give the order for anything you want to drink.\n\nWe happened to be in this place about six o’clock evening, when it is very busy. The offices and places of business just having closed. To see these smartly dressed men of all nationalities, the majority of them wearing the national equivalent for a hat, namely the Red Tarboosh is a very pretty sight indeed. Large numbers of soldiers visit this place, privates rubbing shoulders with officers of all ranks. Reached back to camp as the bugle sounded \"lights out\".\n","75":"\n\nA piece of music which is very familiar to our ears in the mornings is the \"Dead March\". The reason for this is obvious, some soldier has passed to his last resting place.\n","76":" H.D.\n\nOn pass after 2 p.m. D.I. and myself went round by the Sphinx. We had our photo taken in front of the Sphinx with the Pyramid as a background. We hired camels and had the photos taken as we were seated on their backs.\n\nWe then rode round by the Pyramids. Dismounting at the third\/second Pyramid we entered it, guided by an Egyptian guide.\n\nWe had to slide a great way down into the earth, before we reached the chambers. There are nine chambers in this pyramid, some of which are very small. This pyramid was differently constructed from the other one I had visited.\n\nIn this case the chambers were made away down in the solid rock and the pyramid built over them. I liked this one better than the great pyramid.\n\nHaving seen all that was to be seen, we were taken to a tomb of one of the Rameses. It was only a hole in the sand. We hesitated to go under. We went under however, and we were very much surprised and also were delighted when we saw the inside walls, which would be no more than three feet high. We were in a bent position all the time.\n\nOn the walls which were solid rock, were beautiully carved hyeraglphic figures, depicting various scenes in the life of the individual, agriculture, fishing etc. It was really delightful to see this ancient art. It is said to be 6,000 years old.\n\nIn the evening we went in the car \n\nto Cairo.\n\nAfter having tea in Groppi’s we walked about town seeing what was to be seen.\n\nThe streets were crowded with troops. One saw sights in some of these streets which they are not likely to forgot. At door after door we saw groups of soldiers standing around numbers of young women. One, at a distance thought these young women very pretty, but on closer examination one drew back with disgust at their debased appearance. To make up for their lost beauty they had painted themselves about the face and dressed themselves in a fairly becoming fashion, which would have cheated all but the close observing. There is no doubt that some of these young women had been very pretty. The life they were leading had degraded them.\n\nThey were inviting the soldiers up to their rooms which some of them were foolish enough to do. Many of these young men rue the day they entered into hospital, back to Aust – as undesirable, ruined, not only themselves, but others, for life.\n","77":" 9th","78":" Wednesday,. P. all back P3.26.

We sailed for two hours up the river. The afternoon was beautiful and the time we sailed was the best time of the day, just as the sun was going down and the extreme heat had cooled off.\n\nThe palm trees growing on the banks of the river gave it the fine oriental appearance. We saw a double shaduf lift, means of which water is raised to irrigate the land. It must be a very laborious job raising this water by means of buckets. We also saw the boats being loaded by natives with stone from the quarries on the Mokattum hills.\n\nThe barges were very peculiar being flat-bottomed and a high curved \n\nbow, the shape of the barge accompanies by the tall fin shaped sails were very interesting.\n\nWe were treated to ices, cakes, and also tea as we sailed up the river. After about two hours sail we anchored near the river bank and were allowed off for an hour or so. In order to get on to the main road which ran parrallel with the canal, this is a regular thing in Egypt, we had to cross through fields of splendid grain. In the cool of the evening once could hardly imagine themselves in Egypt. It was more like being in Scotland on a beautiful summers evening when the corn etc is just beginning to ripen.\n\nHaving enjoyed our short time ashore viewing the natives at their work in the fields, driving home their pecular and I may say ugly looking cattle goats etc we returned to the steamer.\n\nWe had a splendid supper on board and it was enjoyed by everyone.\n\nPrizes were presented to the winners of the sports which were held on deck on our way up. Some of them which were presented to the men were of a humorous kind and were the cause of a great deal of laughter.\n\nMrs McK and M.D. who had entered for the ladies three-legged race were very much surprised and needless to say delighted when they learned that they had won the race.\n\nThe remainder of the evening was spent in a free and easy concert in which some very good singing was given. We arrived back at 10 pm.\n\neveryone having enjoyed the outing very much.\n","135":"","136":"\n\nWent out shooting quail this afternoon along with D & S. We got the loan of two guns and cartridges from Abdul the restaurant keeper and in peace times, guide to tourists. He was a fine type of Arab, could speak several languages, and was very intelligent. Along with Mahammed who went with us to raise the game we wandered over Abduls crops. A few birds were raised but the excitement of the moment and the fact we had not handled a gun for a long time we aimed blindly, or the bird was out of range before we had time to fire. We had almost given up hope of bringing down any game when S. by a chance shot hit one a short distance away.\n\nIn our endeavour to secure the bind we wandered into somebody else’s ground and a native woman came out and shouted all sorts of things in her native tongue at us. Mohammed know what she said we did’nt, but one could gather from her gesticulations and excited manner that their was trouble brewing for us if we went much further. We got the bird and returned home.\n\nThe birds are very small and so that their would be enough for us all we decided that Abdul should provide us with two birds each, cook them, and we then had a delightful tea on quails very nicely done up.\n\nWe had our photos taken. The solitary \n\nquail, about half a dozen natives and the \"gallant sportsmen\".\n\nIn the evening D.R & I hired donkeys from the donkey boys who are always to be found at the foot of the Pyramids. As a rule the boys belonging to the donkeys run behind to goad the donkeys on. We asked them to allow us to have the donkeys to ourselves for the time being. This was disartrious to me at least. We went up to the Sphinx, the donkey moved along all right there as the boys happened to be behind. After the boys left us I could not get my donkey to go at all. I hammered it with my cane till the cane broke in two. With the small piece that was still left in my hand I hammered till making a desperate blow at his hind quarters I missed,almost upsetting myself off the donkey and the piece of cane flew out of my hand. Being left with nothing in my hand I took off my leather belt and wallopped him with this formidable whip, but to no avail. So long as he was going away from his station he was as stubborn as the proverbial mule. Giving the game up as hopeless, and turning his head homewards I reached the station in double quick time. Whither the donkey or I was more pleased I do not know. I don’t think it could be any more pleased than myself. We’ll call it quits.\n","137":"","138":" 23rd","139":" 25th Sund.\n\nSpent the afternoon in Esbekiah Gardens Cairo. A Territorial Brass Band was\n\ndiscoursing music there.

Some came in singing, others were telling there experiences in rather a humorous fashion. Some of them had been wounded on the barges going over and others had only been a few minutes on the peninsular or perhaps hours. Their clothes were all tattered and torn and covered with blood and mud, having travelled the few hunded miles in this condition. One could see that some of them had had very narrow escapes.

Outside one of the mosques there are numerous marks on the wall said to have been caused by the bombardments of Napoleon’s army. One large hole was pointed out to us. It contained a round object, a cannon ball, which had lodged there.\n\nThe few mosques which I have seen since I came here are all pretty much alike as regards architecture and decoration. They have all beautiful glass stained windows. The colours Red, Blue, Orange and Green nicely blended. A border, high up on the wall, written in Arabic all passages from the Koran in golden colours. There is a niche in the wall of the mosque which faces the east towards the Mohammadan Holy City Mecca. The mohammedans always pray facing the east. At this part there is also a narrow staircse leading up to the pulpit. Devotions are conducted from this pulput every Friday, this day being their Sunday.\n\nApart from the special devotions on Friday services are also held every day 6 a.m. 12 noon, 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n\nTall minarets are also an indespensible part of a mosque. From these minarets the people are called to prayer by the priests. I climbed to the top of one of those minarets and had a splendid view of the surrounding country.\n\nThe second largest mosque in the world is the Mohammed Aly Mosque which is at the highest part of the Citadel. Before going into the Mosque proper, at the place where the Mohomadeans wash their hands and feet there is a clock said to have been placed there by Napoleon. This part of the mosque had no roof over it. Going into the part where devotions are held we found it laid with beautiful, soft, carpet.\n\nThe walls are made of alabaster. One small part was pointed out where imitation alabaster was place by Napoleon who took away the real kind. The difference was very noticeable after it had been pointed out to us. In this mosque there are about 200 lamps which are lit at certain times of the year. At that time it must be a very pretty sight.\n","154":"","155":"\n\nGot a number of original photos of the Aust – troops landing in the peninsular.\n\nAn address and concert given to the wounded in hospital under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A.

Had been on night duty, which, coupled with the very hot day made one very drowsy. To work during the night is very well, but one cannot very well get sleep during the day, owing to the extreme heat even in tents and also the flies almost drive \n\none wrong in the mind. To lie under the shade of a tree or wall is much cooler than to lie in closeness of a tent. The flowing robes and the loosely fitting, light coloured clothes of the natives gives a good illustration of how the people of a country cloth themselves to suit their climate conditions.\n\nDuring the hotter part of the day from 12 midday to 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon one comes across natives lying in the shade of a tree or a wall even on the pavement of the streets in the city. Lying on the ground they throw their cloak over their heads to save them from the fly nuisance. I can’t help thinking that the manner in which the native women carry their water jugs and their baskets on their heads is meant for the same purpose, namely to ward off the flies. By carrying thse things on their heads, their hands are free. It is very interesting to see these women balancing their water jugs and baskets on their heads and waving the hands and arms in a peculiar fashion as if to whisk away the flies. Necessity is the mother of invention and this method saves the use of the fly whisks that the people of this nation use at this time of the year in Egypt.\n\nA kind of tree which looks very pretty at this time of the year is . It is similar to our Rowan tree but has beautiful blossom of a nice bluish tint. It is grown a great deal here to line the roadways and looks very pretty.\n\nAmongst the working class of the city \n\nthere is a certain amount of vanity. They go through, doing their work at an easy going pace during the day (in the evening) In the evening putting their robes over them, walking stick in hand, they walk home in such a jaunty fashion that one would think they had’nt a care in the world. Some of the natives employed at the hospital have surprised one very much in this respect. Many times I have met them on the street and failed to recognise them until they had recognise me.\n\nWhilst seated in a tram car on my way to Cairo to-day a well-dressed Arab sat down beside me. As he sat down he greeted me with the salutation\"How are you\"? with the emphasis on the you. I replied \"Very well thank you\". He then began chatting away on a variety of interesting subjects to which I listened or replied as the case may be with delighted interest. After we had talked to-gether for some time, he rather startled me with the remark \"Your not an Australian your either a Scotsman or an Irishman more Scotch than Irish, I think.\"? I was much amused at this remark. \"Yes\" I said, I am a Scotsman. \"Ah\" he said, the only part that is Australian about you is your uniform\". This Arab could speak very good English. He was a guide and some of these guides can speak quite a number of languages. I have had quite a number of similar experiences like the above and they all go to show that these people who come in contact with other nationalities can tell by one’s accent the country to which one belongs.\n\nAnother class of native one comes across, and he is a pest, is the one who is always begging. They are continually beg, beg begging socks, shirts, boots, in fact anything which one has or wears seems to be the thing which they would like to have. They pester the life out of one, no matter how you talk to them. They do not lack for perserverance. Sometimes I feel inclined to give this class of people a bar of soap, for they are usually very dirty and smell awful. The chances are if one gave them a bar of soap they would throw it away.\n\nSent P.A.\n","161":"","162":" No. 5 ward.\n\nShifted into new sleeping quarters. The room is at the top of the hotel looking out on to the Pyramids.\n","163":"","164":" 20th,","165":" 22nd Sat.\n\nVisited the Cairo Zoo which is situated near Ghaza. It is beautifully laid out and has a splendid collection of wild animals. The best collection of animals I have ever seen. The pontoons by means of which the Turks had endeavoured to cross the Suez Canal early this year were on exhibition in the zoo. They were very much damaged by shot and shell.\n\nThere is a splendid Grotto here. To-day being an exceptionally hot day it was very refreshing to sit in the cool shade and listen to the music of the water as it tripped over the artificial rocks which formed the grotto. Seated in the cool shade of the grotto one could picture up pretty scenes similar, but on a larger scale, \n\nin the glens and amongst the mountains of Bonnie Scotland.\n\nI also visited the Snake House in the zoo. I thoroughly enjoy this visit to the zoo and hope to spend more afternoons there. The entrance price ½ Piastre 1o\/4 in English money.\n\nThere are a number of beautiful gardens around Cairo. After leaving the zoo I strolled through some of them. They are closed to the public at sunset. The black Sudanese Park Keeper goes around at closing time ringing a bell to warn the peoples that the gates are soon to be closed.\n\nThese gardens are well taken advantage of by the people. People of all nationalities congregate there. Nurse maids with their charges and children predominate. Young & old Egyptians go there with their books to read, generally reading aloud or sit in a ring discussing with one another what they read. Walking through these gardens one is often asked to answer a question in English by some of them, so earnest do they seem in acquiring knowledge.\n","166":"\n\nItaly declares war on the Germs. \n\nLooking out to the East from the verandah of Mena one saw the sunrise which was exceedingly beautiful.\n\nThe natives are up early and all busily working in their fields. The harvesting of certain grains is at present going on. The grain is (put on) heaped on to \n\nthe backs of camels and taken to a place outside the village into small heaps. There it is being threshed in a very antiquated manner. A vehicle, something like a large armchair with a flat bottom, is used. The Yellaheen seats himself on this and is drawn round in a circle by bullocks. It struck one as very funny to see a man seated on one of these vehicles with a huge umbrella held over his head. This was not to keep off the rain but to shield himself from the intense heat of the sun.\n\nA description of what is to be seen in the fields just now near our camp should be very interesting, at least it is very pretty and would require the work of a good artist to do justice to it in a picture.\n\nA small part of the field where the grain is ripe for harvesting there are a dozen natives, men and women and children. Some are cutting the grain, others are loading it on to the backs of camels, whilst some of the older natives are sitting in the crouched up fashion peculiar to them, deep in conversation, and the children are running about playing with one another as children of other countries do. On the part where the corn has been cut, cattle, donkeys and goats are grazing. This with the sand of the desert in front and the green setting behind formed a very pretty picture.\n","167":"","168":"\n\nLarge number of birds of the swallow type are flying about here.\n\nSent P.C.A. away.\n\nIn Cairo. Visited Geizerah Palace where the greater part of our hospital is at present.\n\nThe evenings are clear up to seven o’clock. There is no twilight.\n","169":"\n\nA number of French wounded who were on a visit to the Pyramids had their photo taken in front of Mena House. More patients going out, none coming in. Some of the wards are being closed down.\n","170":"\n\nExceptionally hot to-day.\n\nIt is glorious to sit on the verandah here and look out on the dark outline of the Pyramids in the night moonlight with the evening so nice and cool.\n\nIn spite of the fact that we are so well off in comparison with the men who are in the trenches, there is a feeling of dissatisfaction amongst those of us who are here. We went to get nearer the scene of action. I suppose it is human nature to be discontented. All our tents have been taken down and we are now sleeping in rooms in Mena House. \n\nT. M. fell from his horse and was dragged along the road for about a hundred yards and was pretty badly injured.\n","171":"\n\nRead \"The Pleasures of Life\" by Lord Avebury.\n\nWent into the large swimming bath at Mena at five o’clock. Did not take advantage of \n\nthis before owing to so many of the troops using it and the water being so seldom changed.\n\nThe long stretch of Acacia trees which line the road to the Pyramids have taken on leaves of a nice light green tint which looks very pretty.\n","172":" In Cairo.\n\nWent to the gardens with I. M. The gardens are at their loveliest at this time. It is simply glorious to walk through these gardens.\n\nTwenty eight re-inforcements have arrived at Ghezirah. This should make things much lighter on us if we should get busy again.\n","173":"\n\nWeather still continues to be hot. \n\nIn Cairo. It is amusing, if one happens to stand at any point waiting on a tram etc, how the native urchins gather round and jabber away in their native tongue to you. I found this is a good opportunity to learn a few words of their languages. The method adopted is to say English – \"tea\" \"Arabic\"?. If they understand straightway, the answers comes Arabic \"Shay\". This method makes on the possessor of numerous necessary words quite simply and incidentally causes some amusement amongst these black urchins.\n","174":"","175":" 4th Frid\n\nSaw the sun set from the Citadel.

Special Case.\n\n200 Tommies arrived from the Dardanelles, wounded.\n","183":"","184":"\n\nDrove to the Citadel with M. Had a look through the Mohammed Ali Mosque. From the Citadel we drove through narrow streets to the Bazaar district called \"The Mouski\". Visiting the Bazaar district was the most interesting and the most fascinating pastime that I had in Egypt.\n\nThe Rue Mouski seems to be the place where the natives do their commercial business. It is not a very broad street, and during the day is very busy. The men passing too and fro, usually in gaudily coloured and flowing robes, and wearing on their heads the favurite head gear, the Red Tarboosh or the Turban gives \n\nthe place a picturesque Eastern appearance.\n\nAll along the street one finds the shop, or a better term for them, stalls are open to the street. One rarely finds a window in the shops. They have a very leisurely way of doing business. The people will sit for hours bargaining for articles.\n\nOne often comes across the shop keeper and others seated inside the shop conversing with one another in what seems to be a very brotherly fashion. This seems to be amongst the Egyptians, a favourite pastime and a favourite means of doing business.\n\nIt is when I get into the side streets or to be more correct alleys that I find the greatest pleasure and fascination. \n\nIn spite of the unkempt roadway and the musty smell one seems to forget these things and look on the new scene, away from the heat of the burning sun, with great pleasure and a feeling that one has been transported to a new and enchanted world.\n\nBeautifully engraved Brass and Copper ware are favourite articles of merchandize with the natives. These ornaments, Coffee Sets, Plates, Rose Bowls, Vases, Obelisks, Candlesticks etc. are beautifully engraved by hand. This process one see often being done by the native workmen outside the shop door and it is marvellous how expert they become. Even little boys about ten years of age turn out beautiful work.\n\nThe things depicted by the engraving are usually inscriptions from the Koran, or representations of Ancient Egyptian monuments like the Pyramids, and the Sphinx and also stories of Ancient Egyptian History.\n\nAs one makes their way up the alley one feels as if the upper stories of the buildings are going to tumble down on one’s head. One reflects that they have stood that way for ages and we go on our way with a feeling of relief. Next we see gaily coloured slippers which look very attractive and quaint. Inside the recesses one sees the shoemaker making these slippers.\n\nStrolling along to the next shop we find cases of precious stones, some imitation, but most are real; so the shop keeper says! However they look very well indeed, some exceptionally beautiful. Other cases contain ancient Egyptian Ornaments, Scarabs, Rings, etc. Passing on a little further we come to the Silk warehouse. There we find some lovely silk Shawls, Wrapps and beautiful embroidery. A favourite article to be found in these kind of places is the native tent work. This usually takes the form of pieces of cloth sewn on to a piece of stout canvass so as to form the figure of one of the many Egyptian gods. To look at these tent work figures from a short distance they look exceedingly pretty.\n\nTo wander round these various places one comes across all kinds of oddities in brass work, embroidery, carving in woodwork etc.\n\nWorkmen at their various occupation of repairing carpets, polishing precious stones, embroidery, making tarboosh, walking sticks, form a very interesting and instructive part to a visit here. These things are mostly hand done.\n\nThe above scenes are repeated along the narrow alley. We meet some interesting personages in these places. The waterman with his leather water bag over his back comes down the alley distributing water to those who wish a drink or may be scattering the water on the ground to \"lay the stone\". He is a pretty poor man and we learned that some of the business men probably had paid him for his bag of water thus the reason for his lavish manner of distributing the water.\n\nWe meet women carrying on their heads cage-like baskets containing rabbits or poultry which are for sale.\n\nOne also finds that their are men who have travelled a good bit to be found amongst these shop keepers. We asked one of the salesmen why it was that they put a price on a certain article and after bargaining for a long time he seems quite please to accept half the first price\n\nThis man had been in London for three years. He was a Syrian. He said that he had tried our principle here but had found it of no use. He put up a notice to the effect that all his articles had one price and one price only. The result was, no sales the first day, no sales the first week, no sales for the month, so he gave it up in disgust and conformed to the custom of the other merchants in the bazaar and practised the bargaining principle. Another man we came across, a big, burly fellow seated outside the door of a brassware shop, engraving a large brass plate. He broke into conversation with us as we stood watching him at his work. He told us, a party of three we were, our correct ages much to our amazement. In conversing with him we learned that he had been in London. He had made his livelihood there as a conjuror and he proved to us that he was a conjuror by doing a few tricks with a coin. As we left him he gave us a hearty invitation to come back again.\n\nThere is one thing about these men, they are very, very, shrewd. They have a fine persuasive manner with them.\n\nIt is pretty difficult to express in words the fascination of these bazaars. Personally I have never enjoyed anything better. I have met chaps who felt like myself in this respect\n\nand I have also met others who were bored with the place.\n","185":"\n\nWent to the Scots Church in Cairo this morning. During the day the sun was exceedingly hot and the sweat simply pours out of one. The sweat could be seen on my light drill clothes which we wear here.\n\nIt amuses one to see some of the chaps who have not yet been issued with their light clothing, coming in to church with the sleeves of their tunic rolled up.\n\nThe evenings are nice and cool. It is very cold about 2 o’clock in the morning.\n\nIn spite of the fact that we are having a comparatively easy time here I wish to get away to the scene of action. Trying to arrange a transfer with a chap in the Field Amb.\n","186":"","187":" Temperature 1150\n\nBeing on night duty owing to the extreme heat during the day I cannot sleep well. The tents seem to accentuate the heat. One advantage of Ghezirah, their are no mosquitoes.\n","188":"\n\nWalked through the Ghezirah Gardens this evening. There is a feeling of peace and quietness their in the cool of the evening. Women of different nationalities come out to these gardens as the sun goes down. Most of them are nursemaids looking after the children.\n\nThe gardens are beautifully kept. The grass is beautiful and green and are continually being \n\nwatered by natives during the hot part of the day.\n\nThese gardens are situated along the banks of the River Nile. Along the banks of the River, numerous House boats are fastened. On these, people have their homes and also use them for journeying up and down the river for pleasure.\n\nAcross the river, on the other side stand the Kasr-el-Nil Barracks, a huge place, in which English Territorials are at present stationed. At present the river looks very pretty and with an occasional neat little yacth sailing along or the heavy looking flat bottom cargo boats with their tall fin shaped sails and the edge of the boat almost (to) on a level with the water and the dark coloured crew forms a very pretty picture.\n","189":"\n\nRecieved a letter which had taken 7 months to reach me from Aust -.\n\nJune","190":"","191":"","192":"\n\nWent to church with M.

A few mishaps also happened during the trip which added spice to the outing. \n\nFirst of all we lost the five minutes to four tram and had to wait half an hour on the next one. When we were about two miles from the Pyramids this car jumped the rails and we had to get off.\n\nI tried to bargain for a camel to take us to the Pyramids but all to no avail, so we had practically to walk all the way.\n\nWhen we reached the foot of the Pyramids we managed to get a camel and a donkey and have a joy-ride round the Pyramids and the Sphinx. Arrived home at 8 o’clock. \n\nSoldiers being invalided home to Australia left here to embark on the \"Ballarat\" at Alex – only 6 patients left in No. 6 ward.\n","198":"\n\nWent to church.
