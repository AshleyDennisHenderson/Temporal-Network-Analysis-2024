Year’s day in Egypt. I wonder where the next will be, I sincerely trust that it will be back in dear old Aust.\n\nAlthough on this date I am under going 7 days C.B. . I have made some New Year resolutions which I am endeavouring to keep. \n\nTo-days happenings are briefly Inspection by Sir George Reid in the morning.\n\nSports meeting by the","2":" L.H. in the afternoon at which only 7 was present.\n\nPresented with tins of chocolate by Aust. London War Assocns.\n","3":"\n\nOur hospital staff has been very busy lately. Every day six patients have gone into the main hospital at the Citadel. Mostly the cases are of double pneumonia and sending them away from us means that they are going away to die.\n\nThere have been a lot of accidents through horse falls etc lately I picked up one yesterday that had been rolled on.\n\nWe had a fine medical officer named Dr Fiaschi of Sydney, he is a capt of A. sect. of L.H.F.A. We now have a N. Z. dentist Lieut. Logan in our camp.\n\nGranted half holiday in p.m. and presented with first class knives & tin opener combined.\n","4":"\n\nChurch Parade in a.m. & bath parade p.m. then rode to prison. Wrote home – to-day, received a letter from my sister, dated Nov 6th but no other mail has come to hand yet.\n\nPneumonia is very bad in camp at present, one man died buried to-day, a Victorian. Our work is now in full swing, whilst the L.H. are starting manoovers.\n\nThere was a race meeting at Gezira on Saturday. There were two Australian horses entered, both as fat as mud, yet they ran first & second, never extended there names were Boom ridden by Barc G. S & Hinemoa,\n","5":"\n\nTo-day is the last of our C.B. punishment, our fatigue duties all day in close sequence. Every day there is now a court martial or enquiry in some of the regiments. The sooner we are away from here the better. Camp life is too monotonous for men eager to get to the front.\n\nOur horses are losing a lot of flesh, owing to poor quality of the feed, rice hulls are mainly used it is called “bippur\".\n","6":"\n\nFirst day after C. B. at night I went out of bounds for a good feed to a cafe called The Bord du Nile, - we sat down at a table and next to us was one of our officers & the S. M. I fully expected another lot of C.B. but nothing came of it, as the officers were out of bounds themselves.\n\nOur work is real ambulance drill now, with the waggons & transports complete. The bearers have had some drill galloping out to wounds in sessions. The qualities of the horses has caused much discussion, each man thinking he owns a Carbine so the officers are trying to promote a sports meeting.\n","7":"\n\nNews of a great capture of a complete army corp of Turks by the Russians has reached us, and as the former are being badly beaten in Syria and Constantinople in a State of revolution it does not look as if the Turks have a hope so we will not miss them, but wait here, until ordered to the front, where the Canadians are at present. This is not a healthy place by any means as one third of our corp is daily on the sick list.\n","8":"\n\nAwful weather, horrible gusty south-east wind, it comes across the desert like a blast from the ice. It is bitterly cold & cuts right through into the bone. Dust envelopes everything insomuch that one cannot see a dozen yds ahead.\n\nIn the p.m. a few of us walked our ponies over pretending they were lame and saw a native burial, it was most interesting.\n\nAt picquet at night, now only one man is on at a time and it is hard work as horses keep getting loose & tangled up in ropes all night.\n","9":"\n\nWhilst galloping his horse this morning one of our officers Capt Ramsden met with what may have been a nasty accident. His horse stumbled & fell heavily breaking its neck & dying instantly. We extricated the Capt immediately.\n\nWe received a lot of mail from Aust to-day but it was all Dec. 10th so consequently there are three months gone astray. I rec. two letters but not the ones I wanted one tells me that my brother Harold has joined the force. He is in camp at Broadmeadows. A paper came to hand with the report of a divorce case in which our Colonel was co-resp. The scandal caused much amusement.\n","10":"\n\nMelb. papers are greatly appreciated by the men, apparently things are very bad over there at present. Recruiting is being carried on briskly so our reinforcement must be near Alexandria now.\n\nAll the N. Zealanders paraded to-day before Sir Thomas Mackenzie at Gezira & he delivered a stirring address to them.\n\nThere are a few black sheep Australians who have been playing up in Cairo and consequently get the Aust. a bad name.\n\nSaturday afternoon is now a half-holiday which is needless to say very popular.\n","11":"\n\nChurch Parade as usual in a.m. Bathing Parade to the prison in the afternoon rode our horses up.\n\nComing home we bought a pup for half a piastre (1 ¼) off some native children. Sunday night went for a walk and got into another scrap, we climbed a wealthy Arab verandah to see a native concert & got chased by a gaffir.\n\nOur sports meeting is decided on & will be held on Sat week. There is a first class programme and we are all training our horses in friendly rivalry. I am appointed on the committee to hold a concert at night.\n","12":"\n\nImportant news, the Div. Amm. Col. left this morning for Mena. Hear that the Turks are in close proximity and are very strong in Palestine. It is rumoured that we will leave in about three weeks time. Tonight at the recreation hut there was a splendid concert and lecture on The Desert with lantern slides. I got a treble encore with my recitations. There was a sad happening last midnight a man named McDowell of the D.A.C. was hit by a train at Maadi station and was terribly mutilated, he was brought to our hospital where he had both legs amputated, but the shock was too much & the poor fellow died in fearful agony about 6 a.m.\n\nThe inquiry into the death of the horse was held in the morning & a verdict of misadventure was resolved.\n\nWe all put down fresh horse lines to-day as the old ones were nearly all pulled out of the ground.\n\nThe surprise of the year was a pretty ceremony at night it was the marriage of one of our most popular officers Capt. Fowler. His bride has come all the way from Aust. & only arrived a few days ago. After the ceremony the happy couple went to Shepheard’s Hotel. We had no rice so we threw the next best thing – horse barley. The men were all invited to drink their health.\n\nBurial to-day of the accident. More court-martials this morning. The two corporal cooks were charged with drunkenness but escaped with a severe reprimand. The S.M. had two paltry cases but both were dismissed. It is his doings that are causing all the dissatisfaction amongst the men.\n\nWhilst one of our hospital waggons was returning from the hospital it was attacked by natives with stones but no damage was done. Mail day received a letter from Mother dated Dec 11th. Pay night also, as my increment does not start until","13":" I had to get an advance from the Colonel.\n","14":"\n\nEvery thing seems to point that we will move shortly our horses being fed six & seven times daily, whilst our saddlery is being well rubbed & cleaned.\n\nEntries closed to night for our sports meeting to be held on Sat. week. A fine programme has been arranged and I expect to run well in the V.C. race with Sammy and also in the relay race. They are the only two I have entered for. More stray mails received.\n","15":"\n\nWe have received a lot of gifts from kind donors such, as rice, tea, cocoa, chocolate, raisins etc. which are greatly appreciated.\n\nThere is plenty of Aust. news circulated about the camp now, as we have rec. a lot of Aust papers it seems that they know as much about our movements in Aust as we do, and our letters are three weeks late with the news.\n\nIssued with extra pair of blankets to-day, I now have 5 and an eiderdown.\n\nRec. a letter from E at last to-night dated","16":"\n\nHad a half holiday & went to Mena & saw the Pyramids & Sphinx then went to Mena Camp where all the infantry, Artillery & Vic LH are. I do not like the camp. I prefer Maadi much better, the sand at Mena is as Nile delta & must be heavy on the infantry. All the men out there are sick of it and anxious to be on the move. I saw a lot of my Melbourne mates, they are all well.\n\nWhilst we spend our recreation time in talking horses the infantry spend theirs in boxing. They have a fine stadium & fight every night. I spent an enjoyable day & returned late at night.\n","17":"\n\nUsual Sunday routine, in the p.m. I wrote all day & night and set a lot of views & few home truth – E –. And Ess.\n\nMore talk about going, Heliopolos & Zeitoun this time. The infantry at Mena had a last march a couple of days ago.\n\nWe all turn out & feed our horses with lucerne at retreat now, they are doing better now.\n","18":"\n\nWell, it is settled now we are going to Zeitoun in about 10 days time to join the N. Z. and make one big camp of the 1st L.H. Brigade. S. & N. Z. div. We have route marches in the morning now and stretcher drill in the afternoon, everyone abhors it & tries to dodge it.\n\nAt night there was a fine lecture in the recreation tent on Mohomadenanism by the American missionary in Cairo – Dr Rowntree. It was instructing & interesting & showed us what an enormous following this strange religion has.\n","19":"\n\nEvery thing points to our sports meeting & concert being a big success, we have over £10 subscribed in prize money & refreshment fund.\n\nA hospital ship from Aust. with all the doctors on board arrived in Cairo a few days ago. Pneumonia is very prevalent one of our tent mates is in the Citadel hospital in a severe condition with it.\n\nOur hospital is doing marvellous work since we have been here there have been 200 admissions to the hospital and over 500 out patients, showing what a heavy percentage the illnesses in this camp, and yet it is called a health resort.\n\nOn picquet at night, man brought in with a fractured jaw.\n","20":"\n\nOn M.P. duty all day long nothing of note happened. We continue to hear good news from the front.\n\nTurks are reported to be on their way and then we hear contradictory rumours.\n\nEvery man is busy cleaning up the saddlery for the preparation. Good entries now and a fine fund subscribed by each man.\n\nAll the corp was out marching in the morning.\n\nStretcher drill in a.m. .\n","21":"\n\nAn all day route march. We left at nine thirty and wended our way to Helouan alongside the Nile, the scenery was beautiful and quaint. The road runs alongside the river all the way. The sight was splendid as the long caravan of red cross waggons passed with all the mounted bearers. The roads are so smooth that they are like glass and a couple of horses slipped. We had on the river bank returned home at the bend and were in camp \n","22":"\n\nIn the morning went for a short march & the drivers had some driving practice for the sports to-morrow. I met with an accident and am forbidden to ride to morrow. Afternoon was spent in preparing the sports ground. \n\nThe hospital and all the Aust doctors & Nurses with Ambulance Motor waggons arrived at Maadi. They are establishing a base hospital here as The Citadel and Mena House is full. \n\nAt night I recited and got a great reception at a concert given by the S. Aust Light Horse to the residents of Maadi.\n","23":"\n\nThe sports were a great success, I could not compete but lent my pony “Sammy\" to a mate. We had the despatch and won easily, but unfortunately he could not pull Sammy up in time to hand his despatch over. I wrote a full report that will appear in Monday’s Egyptian Mail. B Section won the aggregate only the minor races going to A.\n\nWe hear that when we move we are going to split and work separately. It will make things more satisfactory & stop the .\n","24":"\n\nIn the morning before C.P. there was a large parade to headquarters where the Brigadier addressed the men, he told them that they were to move off and then gave them a severe lecture on keeping up the good name of the Australians, a Maadi resident had some fowls pinched and we are blamed.\n\nMy English friend called in the afternoon & after showing him around the camp we went to Cairo to his house to tea. Spent a very pleasant evening it is great to sit down to an English table with English friends, without being pestered by native waiters.\n","25":"\n\nAll the bearers of B sect went for a fine trip to Mons well and Napoleon’s Fort & the Colonel & Capt Fowler started revolver practice whilst the horses were eating and they nearly all cleared out. They were caught after a long chase.\n\nThe drivers went for an all day march to Helouan. Very hot day, the worst yet. God forbid when summer comes.\n\nThe army service are transporting every day to Zeitoun. At night all on leave in town were hunted up by a picket and made to return to camp as they had marching orders for the morning.\n","26":"\n\nThe N.Z. Infantry have been sent to the canal at Ismailia where the Territorials are, the enemy are reported in the vicinity. In the morning I drove into Cairo to buy provisions for the concert at night. Concert a great success, best ever, prizes presented & refreshments, mess room packed. My report of the sports in to-days Mail & Mail received from Melb dated 27th Dec, I rec one from Mother telling me a lot of satisfactory news from home. \n\nWe have marching orders for Thursday morning. Expect something of importance to write in a day or two.\n","27":"\n\nBattle of the canal between Turkish & British patriots at Kantara, the enemy lost heavily but the British casualties were very slight. In the afternoon we were all on fatigue loading our transports in readiness for removal to Zeitoun to-morrow. It seems that there will in all possibility be a big scrap on the canal shortly.\n\nThe first base hospital is in a house at Maadi and is an ideal site for such. There is a full nursing staff of men & girls.\n\nThursday, 28 January, 1915\n\nIn the morning our advance guard and the transports left for Zeitoun. The drivers will return to-morrow. All of us have to leave Maadi by Saturday. The reinforcements for the 1st contingent and the motor transport have reported at Alexandria. The second contingent must be very close to Egypt now, judging by Melb newspapers we have seen, they have been playing up and it was a good thing when they sailed. The first contingent I think can hold their own with the","28":"\n","29":"\n\nMen arrived home with transports from Zeitoun and report it a splendid camp superior to Maadi. One of our corporals went to Alexandria to-day to bring back six men as our reinforcements. 1000 of them have arrived at Alexandria. After two men that were killed in the skirmish at Kantara on the canal were buried at Port Said to-day we had a half holiday to day to pack our kits etc. and they were all put on the waggons in readiness to start off to-morrow morning. Reveille will be at 5 a.m. \n","30":"\n\nLeft Maadi at 9 a.m. we went by road right through Cairo, whilst all the L.H. went by the desert. It was a splendid march our bearers in front and then the amb. wag. and trains bringing up the rear. Before we arrived at Zeitoun we had a general salute before the Brigadier. Heliopolis is the most perfect town imaginable no building is less than five stories high, I will describe it elsewhere. We arrived at the camp at 2 p.m. and were all astonished at its magnificence. Every thing was ready for us tents pitched so all we had to do was put our horses on the lines and unload the waggons etc. I struck picquet first night but the horses behaved well.\n","31":"\n\nNo Church parade we were all on fatigue in the morning erecting hospital tents etc and other jobs. We have a splendid mess room and cook house. It is truly a wonderful camp. On the left of us are the N.Zers on the right Heliopolis and the big Egyptian barracks whilst on the other side are the Lancaster Territorials that have not gone to the canal. \n\nI went to Vhena Camp in the afternoon to try and raise some but found my mates in worse difficulties than myself. They are all full up at Vhena trudging about in the heavy sands. Thank God I am in a mounted corp even if we do have longer hours.\n","32":"\n\nOn M.P. the 2nd conting arrived to-day 13,000 of them all infantry with the exception of one reg of Queens L.H. The majority have gone to Maadi and a lot of them are here. They are not a bad type of men but I do not think they come up to the 1st. comparison speaks when they are marching. They say that they had a trip over, the transport with only a submarine as their convoy, there were a lot of deaths on the voyage. It appears that the rest are coming over in batches of 5000 monthly.\n","33":"\n\nOur Sergeant Major has been up to his dirty tricks again, and both officers & men detest him for his sneaky behaviour. He had seven men paraded to-day for various offences and they were all punished with C.B. . Two of the men hard characters played up at night whilst answering defaulters call, & the consequence was that they were paraded again with the result that one got seven days detention in barracks. This is how they make good men turn out rotten. Another man is being courtmartialled tomorrow. More of the 2nd contingent keep arriving day to day as fast as the train arrives.\n","34":"\n\nMore fighting on the Canal. Ismallia has been attacked by the enemy who have a much stronger position than was supposed. The 7th & 8th Batt of Infantry (Vic) & the 2nd Field Ambulance have gone down there. In all probability we may go there shortly. There has been no serious damage done yet, each side has lost a few men.\n\nBattalions of Infantry keep arriving day & night of the 2nd contingent. On picquet at night and saw them coming in as late as 4 a.m. had a disastrous night. The heel rope to which the horses are attached, broke & there was nearly a stampede. I had to call the guard out.\n","35":"\n\nWe are doing practical work now such as picking up wounded & galloping back with him on the back of the saddle. The artillery of the are doing fine work and we are getting quite used to the shriek of live shells. Over 300 Turkish prisoners have been brought to Cairo and they are disheartened and sick of the German Officers. In all there were 16 killed and 40 wounded in the fight the other day but the British only had 3 wounded. Four Turks succeeded in swimming across the Canal and are large here. The Gov has offered a big reward for their capture, any one caught harbouring them will get the full penalty.\n","36":"\n\nAnother skirmish at the canal in which the Turks had 2,400 casualties, and the loss of a machine gun section. The British losses were very slight, we are all eager to get there and are fretting in camp whilst our mates are fighting. The camp now that the 2nd Infantry 13th & 14th Battalions are here reminds us very much of Broadmeadows & the L.H. Brigade had another sham fight to-day. The artillery are firing live shells regularly whilst we are doing ambulance drill suitable for this country. We picked up a N.Zealander to-day who had cut his throat & wandered into the desert.\n","37":"\n\nThere is another field ambulance next us attached to the Infantry. There equipment and methods of training cannot compare with us. The 2nd contingent are spending money wholesale and the natives are making the same fortune out of them as they did out of us when we first arrived.\n\nA fine Y.M.C.A was opened yesterday with all kinds of conveniences for the troops. Our hospital is not doing so much now as we are transferring all patients to the base hospital in Heliopolis formerly the Palace Hotel the largest of its kind in the world it cost £2,500,000. The Aust red cross nurses look very well in their smart uniforms. \n","38":"\n\nChurch parade as usual C. of E. minister very popular. I had a lot of friends out to see me in the p.m., English and those that had arrived in the 2nd contingent. A lot of our men are suffering from a kind of sore throat that goes septic. The Turkish prisoners captured on the canal are arriving at Cairo daily. One of the fugitives that escaped was caught by a Territorial in town to-day. The prisoners state that they are sick of the German Officers and are deserting whilst their officers are shooting them down like dogs. Desertions are very frequent.\n","39":"\n\nThe L.H. Brigade went out for a sham fight and bivouacked at night so far we the L.H. Amb bearers are having a fine holiday, we only go out for rides over the desert and surrounding places and are seeing the sights of Egypt that would cost a total of £3 a week for expenses only. The drivers on the other hand do waggon drill all day long the wounded from the canal are expected to-day and will go to the hospital in Heliopolis.\n\nSammy has turned a real bad little devil and is becoming worse every day. He went mad for about five minutes to-day & bucked & reared. I ride him one day & Mary his mate the next.\n","40":"\n\nNews comes from the canal that the Turks are in retreat as they are scared of water, if so it will not be long before we go to the front as our original duty of embarkation is near.\n\nWe rode in the morning out into the desert and saw the N.Z L H drilling in the p.m. I rode Ginger out to the Obelisk and the Virgin’s tree. The latter is a sycamore tree at which the Virgin rested one half of it is dead. The Obelisk is an enormous pillar of solid granite and is beautifully carved.\n","41":"\n\nReveille 5 a.m. all out every unit in Egypt in a great concentration march. We were in full marching kit, blankets, picketing ropes & pegs etc. We left camp at 7.a.m and took up our position in the rear of the enormous cavalcade. We had to halt and the long procession turned back and passed us Artillery, Sig, Inf, 5 battalions, Terriers and N.Z, it was a grand sight and I must confess the Aust were the best of the lot. We had a lot of walking and dismounting every half hour waiting for orders which were transmitted by field telephone, we had lunch at Marghia & after an eventful day returned home to camp to\n\nCont\n\nreceive our mail from home a fortnights. I got a few letters but it is the next mail I am looking for. Sammy gave me a terribly rough ride he has cultivated every vice imaginable, he rears, bites, kicks and bucks, and reefs your arms out the more I fought him the worse he got, if he does not improve I am going to get rid of him.\n","42":"\n\nExercising horses all day by riding then we rode over to the pumping station & had a look over it. It was a magnificent sight the engines are the largest I have yet seen, then we went through a beautiful palm glade called Kafr-el-Tamon\n","43":"\n\nIn the morning we went out with the brigade, sham fighting, but we did nothing, only looked on at the attack from a secluded view. I rode Mary & Henry to-day, am giving Sammy a spell.\n\nThe artillery shooting of the N.Zealanders is magnificent altogether the 1st Brigade is doing fine work.\n\nIssued with tunics and underclothing, caps to arrive shortly.\n\nOur reinforcements arrived to-day horses in a day or so. I know one of them they seem a decent lot of chaps.\n\nWent to Heliopolis at night and had a look round.\n","44":"\n\nReinforcements are now allotted to each section. One of the horse transports coming with the 2nd contingent caught fire at Albany and all the horses had to be taken off and another boat sent to Sydney for.\n\nHalf holiday in the p.m I went into Cairo to my English friends house to tea, afterwards went to an English dance and had a splendid time, arrived home just before the sergeant was handing the passes in. The Terriers behaviour in Cairo is not of the best, there are a lot of cockney scum amongst them, and they are like a lot of school boys in their ways.\n","45":"\n\nWent to Presbyterian C.P in the morning to hear Col Plane he is a fine preacher. Some of the bands are very good now and play at all church parades. Wrote home all the p.m. sent present to E. At night I went into Heliopolis to Luna Park and knocked out some fun it is not nearly as good or big as Melb. but the soldiers made fun out of it. Everywhere as it is all over Cairo the Khaki was conspicuous. The Joy wheel was about the funniest thing I ever saw as soon as a Territorial got on a N.Z. would pull him off and then an Aust would pull him off and so. We nearly upset the boat at the water shute as it struck the water.\n","46":"\n\nParty went to Abbassia to get remounts as reinforcements we lost another horse a few days ago, he died in agony with a stricture. The remounts are a rough looking lot and are all over at headquarters waiting to be allotted.\n\nOn M.P. duty all day, it is an easy job, I was paraded by a man to a senior and it was dismissed and he got reprimanded. Had dismounted troop drill on the desert in the p.m. being on duty I dodged it. There is a rumour gaining currency that we are all going to Jaffa in Jerusalem and fight off the Turks. America is threatening Germany to step in if she does not adopt other tactics.\n","47":"\n\nExercising horses leading one each to-day we went to the Arabian Stud farm then through the beautiful oasis of Gafir-el-Gamous with its glorious palm glades it was the sort of ride that inspires one to write.\n\nThe p.m. was spent in throwing water all over the parade ground and around our tents with the object of hardening the sand.\n\nThings are quiet at the front and there is a lull on the canal, the Turks are reported to have 30,000 men either missing, wounded or taken prisoner. Those in Cairo were transferred to to a big prison.\n","48":"\n\nSir Winston Churchill made a fine speech in Parliament on the war, we read it in the home papers. German is threatening, with a blockade of neutrals but it seems farcical in her present position.\n\nCleaned saddlery in preparation for big march to-morrow is of little use here as it is covered in dust a few minutes later.\n\nWent into Cairo at night and spent a very enjoyable evening at Mrs O’B. Did not return home until 3 am the morning dodged guards & m.p’s all the night, as we had no passes.\n","49":"\n\nBig field day with the Brigade. I rode Mary out. We left early at nine and marched till lunch when the bearers went with waggon, the others were left at the dressing station. We went within a few hundred yards of the firing line, when we were told to split and hunt for wounded independently. I gained some important information and reported it then I had to gallop back to head quarters as despatch rider, when I returned I found that the others had discovered four wounded Aussies so we applied first aid and then brought them back to the dressing station, then we returned to camp, tired out after a good day’s work.\n","50":"\n\nBig field day with the Division sham fight between the N.Z Bde and the Aust. attacking a position with Artillery and then with the L.H and Inf. The 4th Field Ambulance and us were in the rear all the way at permanent dressing stations , eventually the bearers were taken over some sand hills to see the fight, after a lot of mounting and dismounting we returned home about six tired, dirty & hungry. Our horses had no water from early morning. We have eaten so much desert sand and dust that we almost spit dust, for this I will not be sorry when we leave Egypt.\n","51":"\n\nCleaned saddlery all the morning inspected by our own officers before stables, I got chipped for having a rusty bit. Inspection of the hospital and lines by the Brigadier also.\n\nHalf holiday as usual stayed home and had a sleep we have a very happy tent party now and every night there is some foolery or horseplay, as soon as my wife and I were in bed another jealous couple tossed us both out of the tent, blankets & all, when we came in again the light was out and there was a great scramble for the blankets, it is always to go to bed last.\n","52":"\n\nB.P. as usual in the a.m after dinner some of the L. Horse tried some of the remounts, and there were some lovely exhibitions of real buck jumping, such as only and Aust. outlaw can give, her rider rode him to a stand still, it opened the eyes of some English officers who were present. One of the boys asked if they would like a ride and one exclaimed Oh, bai Jove the horse jumps too much, jumps were real square bucks. \n\nOn guard at night guarding the front of the camp and collecting the leave passes, needless to say there were none reported back.\n","53":"\n\nExercised horses in the morning. Sammy as usual gave me a rough ride, rooting every dozen yards then rearing and backing in on top of horses so that I could get kicked. Put down a new horse line in the afternoon. Reports are very satisfactory from the Front. The French have regained a lot of lost ground. Yesterday we had a French soldier out to see us, he was wounded at Mons by a splinter of a shell. He is orderly to a visiting French officer to Egypt. He describes the Germans as rotten fighters and cowards in hand to hand fighting. He forecasts the war to last another three months.\n","54":"\n\nIn full marching order and in the broiling sun, the whole L.H.F.A went out for a days manoevers. We commandeered an old building and the tent division, erected a dressing station, the bearers then went out and found some wounded and carried them to the waggons thence to the station, we picketed our horses at the station and had lunch, we returned home about 4 p.m.\n\nNext day and I did not rec. a single letter, if my friends and relations only knew our disappointment, they would write out of sympathy. Attended a lecture at night by Chaplain Werrington on the Aust. Poets at night, I am giving a paper on Lawson next wk.\n","55":"\n\nA great day the sort of day I would like always. We went out in full marching order with the brigade and the sun was just blazing as we marched across the desert in extended order. We then got an order to make off for an oasis whilst the brigade went on. We dismounted in the welcome shade watered & fed our horses, then had our dinner and lay down and went to sleep until 3 p.m then we returned to the camp. I rode Ginger and intend doing so until I get a new horse.\n\nIssued with a lot of woollen comforts, flannels, scarves, handkerchiefs socks etc.\n","56":"\n\nExercised horses in the morning riding one & leading one, over all sorts of rough country, on one occasion we had to dismount and lead our horses over a 3 feet bridge without a rail, if we are not all good rough riders by the time we get back it is not our fault.\n\nI was vaccinated again to-day it is the 3rd time without .\n\nCleaned and saddlery in the p.m.\n\nAccording to newspapers sent the Austs. Have had bad reports circulated about them it is greatly exaggerated although there are a few blk sheep among 50,000 men.\n","57":"\n\nOur big day in the week with divisional all day sham fight. The NZ Mounted Rifles had been out bivouacking for 4 days and were returning to the camp & we had to stop them from crossing the canal at . We erected our clearing hospital near the canal, & the horses were picketed and feeding with their saddles off, whilst we were at dinner, when an alarm came to retreat and we had every thing packed in the waggon, tent & all & horses harnessed and saddled in 11 mins, 9 mins faster than regulation time. When we returned to camp, the Col. Complimented us on our days work.\n\nPay night & badly needed. I got paid 97 ½ piastres.\n","58":"\n\nCleaned saddlery in the morning. I gave my girths & saddle flaps a good softening this time.\n\nI went on French leave into Cairo and had a game of tennis at British club then went to tea at Mrs O’B and spent an enjoyable evening arriving home at 2.30 am, as the police all turn in after midnight. Preparations are being made for a departure shortly since some of the infantry are going this week. The Allied fleet bombarded the Dardanelles yesterday and forced an entrance. This looks as if we may go to Constantinople, and remain there as an army of occupation. I hope not as we all want to see the front.\n","59":"\n\nOn M.P. all day and as soon as I went out I sat down and did some writing including a letter home. I had some friends out to see me and after Retreat went home with them. I returned home very late and was chased by military police on 2 occasions, but I gave them both the slip.\n\nThe 3rd Brigade left for Alexandria to night, and I saw them off. No one seems to know where they are going not even their officers. Some say the Dardanelles, Syria, Jaffa, Alexandretta, Marseilles, Brussels & Southampton that is our present position.\n","60":"\n\nHad a great day in the morning and afternoon a small party of the bearers went to the Canal riding our horses. After traversing some very pretty country, through cocanut & date palm groves we returned home at a hand gallop and there were a lot of small trenches and drains which we had to jump and it ended in a steeplechase with Capt. Fowler in the lead some of the horses jumped splendidly, and this is where Sammy shone, he is in his element when any jumping is to be done, and no height or ditch will stop him, we rode the spare horses to the same place in the afternoon, it was like a day with the Oaklands hounds.\n","61":"\n\nMy Vaccination is giving me a bad time and it has taken too well this time, insomuch as I cannot use my left arm at all and was placed on light duty whilst the others went out riding.\n\nIn the afternoon we had a lecture on notes from the front and it was very interesting and gave us some side lights on the fighting that we had previously not heard of.\n\nThe Allied fleets have successfully bombarded the Dardanelles now so it seems certain that we are going there, we expect to move off inside a fortnight, why we do not go, is puzzling all of us.\n","62":"\n\nAnother big divisional sham fight resulting in a win for our brigade, my arm was too sore to allow me to ride so I went out as on an ambulance waggon, and we were in the one position all day so I coiled up & went to sleep. My lecture on Henry Lawson and his life was a big success in the Y.M.C.A. Col. Plane presided and I got a splendid reception from the big audience, as well as lecturing I recited a few of Lawsons poems which were applauded so well that it attracted a large audience. Col Werrington then asked me to recite my own composition “Thoughts of Home\" and the audience then demanded the Emden, which as usual got a splendid reception. \n","63":"\n\nMy pony had been bad with colic all night so I was told off to watch him in the morning whilst the others exercised horses.\n\nWe have a N.Z dentist with us now and he is doing our work first, I went down to him this morning and had four old stumps out, as they are only liable to ache whilst away on service.\n\nI rode an old spare horse named “stiff-legs\" and led another in the p.m and had the roughest ride since I left Australia. Of all the most useless brutes I have ridden this is easily the worst. On picquet at night very quiet, lovely moonlight night.\n","64":"\n\nSpent all morning cleaning and polishing saddlery and ourselves for a big inspection of the 4th field ambulance and us by General Williams D.M.O. We turned out in splendid order at two p.m and were firstly inspected in front of our parade ground. Then we marched through Heliopolis to the Palace Hotel – the base hospital then back to the camp where we were dismissed only to learn that the division was to have a night attack in the desert and that we would have to go out at 10.30 p.m. in full marching order. We snatched an hours sleep and when the boot and saddle call went at 10.15, each man dressed and saddled his horse without a word. As we marched we were not allowed to smoke or talk and as the long army wound its way into the desert\n\nthe only noise was the dull rumble of the artillery and perhaps the rattle of a horses accoutrements. It was splendidly done and it was awesome and inspiring to watch. Eventually the ambulance halted and we picketed our horses to the waggons and there we stayed till morning. It was bitterly cold and we had no blankets save our great coats. Sleep was impossible owing to the extreme cold and we were all glad to break camp as a heavy fog came up. We returned to camp just before reveille, cold hungry and tired but not despaired for as soon as we were dismissed there were shouts of “are we downhearted accompanied by the answer “no\". The horses were just as pleased to get home as we were and showed it by neighing loudly.\n","65":"\n\nWe had the morning off and in the p.m. I rode Sammy over to Mataruh with the Col Prof. Watson and an amb waggon. We dug up an old Roman graveyard and found some perfect skeletons, beads, scarabs, jewellery etc. and got some fine curios, the graves are 2000 B.C.\n","66":"\n\nC.P. as usual in afternoon. I went into Heliopolis Hospital to see a friend a N.Z. Sergeant who was run over by a gun limber. There have been a lot of deaths both here and at Mena House through pneumonia & pleurisy. \n\nI marvelled at the splendour of the palace interior, everything is of marble and alabaster, it cost two & a half million pounds.\n","67":"\n\nIssued with fresh first aid dressings & bandages etc for our pouches also big marlin spike knife with lanyard.\n\nWent to Cairo on duty in the afternoon and had a fine dinner on my own. I went to Ezbekiya Gardens and picked up with a swiss lady & her daughter, but had to converse in french.\n\nThen I went to O’Bs for tea and spent the evening . they are splendid friends & always make me welcome it is great to sit down to a real table and speak in English and eat decently. Our food is getting very poor & scanty and I have more meals at the canteen than at the messroom.\n","68":"\n\nBig field day with the brigade and on a sham fight in the boiling heat and the desert hotter than hell, our horses had no water until they returned to camp in the evening. Our division wore white hat bands and it was remarkable how this simple bit of color showed up from the Khaki. During the fight we had to retreat and we were all blown up by the enemies artillery, if it was real it would have been good but as we crossed right in front of them.\n\nThe Allied fleet are still bombarding the Dardanelles with success, and I think we will occupy them before long.\n","69":"\n\nExercised horses as we do always when we are not on a field day. The weather is typical of late of hot, oppressive and hot gales of wind that cause the sand to fly and nearly blinds one & the horses too. A third contingent has arrived at Alexandria and have gone to Mena.\n\nMail day to-day & I rec a lot of letters from Aust & home including one from my sister in which she states that she was robbed of her purse by a German but pluckily chased him & got it back, and the case was taken to court and was adjourned for 3 mos. I am quite proud of my sister as I write this.\n","70":"\n\nAccording to the letters we receive from home, our mothers are worrying over our behaviour. It is all through the awful lying reports written by Capt Bean the correspondent. There have been a few black sheep but the wonder is there have not been more, as Cairo offers more temptations than any country I know of. I had a report published in P.U. sent to me and it is thought a lot of by my mates here. All my letters bore good news, but things are very bad in Aust.\n\nPay day to-day and welcome it is as we were all broke. I went to O’R’s at night and had a nice evening.\n","71":"\n\nExercised horses again had some more jumping down on the canal. A. section went out with Bde, on a field day.\n\nAll our horses were clipped by the afternoon by niggers under contract. They clipp well and quickly. They have 3,000 horses to do in five days so they will be going home. There is a big gang working and there is some rare fun with the bad horses.\n\nIt took three niggers and myself to do Sammy. We had to switch him, twist his ears and finally attempted to throw him but no hope we got him finished with difficulty.\n","72":"\n\nCleaned saddlery in the morning and in the afternoon I wrote a lot of letters home & sent a lot of curios, that I excavated home to mother. That was a party out digging again this afternoon and they got a lot of scarabs and found a skull that had been split clean open by a sword. The experts say that it was killed in battle.\n\nOn picquet at night good fine night horses very quiet. \n\nThere was a tradgedy tonight whilst returning from the dance that I always go to at Bulac. A chap was attacked by Dagos and stabbed to death. Over twenty have been arrested by the shaurshes (native police).\n","73":"\n\nC. P as usual in the morning but as we are about to depart every man wanted leave and there were horses to be watered fed & rugged up so I had to stop home. I went into Heliopolis at night after stables met my friends then went home to Shubra with them and they gave me a fine reception, as it may be the last time I will see them if we go on Tuesday. They presented me with a fine box of 100 best Egyptian cigarettes & tobacco pouch unfortunately I returned home late and the O.S. reported me out at roll-call so I have to go to orderly room to-morrow morning.\n","74":"\n\nOrderly Room I was charged with being absent from 10pm to 6 a m as I did not report, but I had the picquet as a witness as to the time I came in. my excuse was accepted by the Colonel and I escaped with a severe reprimand.\n\nBranded horses to-day and it commenced to rain it only rains here twice a year it was lovely. The desert dust was laid and our horses were delighted and reared bucked and bolted all over the desert, appreciating the wet sand and cool air. It was a splendid sight. Another mail in to day I rec 4 letters from Mrs M. Elfie & Edie.\n","75":"\n\nSammy appreciated the wet sand, to indulge in a bolt in the morning jumping into the air about 4 feet every stride. It was exhilarating the air was cool and there was no dust.\n\nLecture in the pm after stables went to the O.’R’s as we may go any day so making the most of opportunities. The Dresden German cruiser was beaten on Sunday and good news came from the front. The army service corp went to Alex yesterday.\n","76":"\n\nRode horses to Canal to obtain mud for the building of an incinerator, loaded eight transports and then came home.\n\nIn the afternoon we heard we were to go out for an all night fight & leave camp at 5.30 pm. Had early stables and coats on saddles when we heard we were not going, we were not sorry as it was a cold night.\n\nSammy has been misbehaving so he has been taken off the line and held up on his own away from the other horses, the poor little devil looks very lonely and repentant.\n","77":"\n\nOn fatigue building a model incinerator with stones and mud. The job took all day and it looked well when we finished.\n\nOn picquet at night. I have been very fortunate this week with letters as I have received over thirteen local & from Aust. big march & bivouac for us to morrow only B. Sect. all sorts of rumors are current concerning the fate of the 3rd Brigade that left a while ago. Issued with caps and a lot of underclothing. The caps are all too small and our kit bags will not hold any more.\n","78":"\n\nLeft camp at 10 a.m. Rode Ginger as Sammy6 has a cut fetlock we winded our way through Heliopolis thence through Zeitoun to Koosoos where we had lunch by the great canal, then all the bearers had to ride ahead and run a relay back to the waggons to report the state of the road we each had to gallop about a furlong. When the waggons arrived we journeyed about two miles and then unhitched and picketed our horses at the bivouac site which was ideal for the purpose, being sheltered by date palms and close to water. We erected the waggon tents fed our horses and had a good tea and then turned in, two men each doing an hour’s picquet through the night. Reveille\n","79":"\n\nWas at 6.30 and we fed up at seven had breakfast and then cleaned up the camp and saddled our horses and rode home after a most enjoyable outing. Two of our men have been transported to Hospital ship Cecilia.\n\nHalf holiday spent in turning out my kit bag as it is so full that I cannot get any more into it we are still getting issues of underclothing & flannells, the latter are a burden and you can buck them for 2 PS. each in the camp. Issued with a new pair of boots. Went to O.’Rs at night. Three British cruisers have been sunk to-day in the Dardanelles.\n","80":"\n\nOn guard all day on the front of the camp, wrote letters home & to friends.\n\nA swarm of locusts invaded the camp to-day it was a great sight they come in millions and are a terrible pest.\n\nI think this is our last week here as we must move before long.\n","81":"\n\nBig review of the 1st N.Z & A. division, a splendid turn out, we were inspected by The high commissioner Sir H. McMahon & General Godley and his staff including French officers from the front. After an inspection we all marched past in review order to salute. It was a splendid sight & did credit to our army. The Col complimented us on our return to camp on our behaviour & appearance we are considered the crack ambulance corp.\n\nHalf holiday in the p.m. Went to O.’Rs again at night.\n\nFour days bivouac & march to Helouan tomorrow.\n","82":"\n\nLeft camp 9.15. I rode Sammy and from the start he played up and bucked nearly all the way across the desert. The transport went by road and we went with the Brigade across the desert to Maadi. The Brigade had to fight their way in against the 3rd Bde of the second contingent who defended it. The enemy sent out a small party to try and draw us into a semi circle but we routed them and then badly defeated the other brigade, driving them home in disorder, it was a splendid piece of fighting. We arrived at Maadi at five and after stables had a good & badly needed feed. Sammy took ill and would not eat, I am disgusted with him, the transport officer threatens to have him shot.\n","83":"\n\nLeft Maadi at 8.30 am and I had to ride an old spare draught horse and lead Sammy as he was too bad to ride, but even that did not prevent him from pulling and making an uncomfortable ride. We passed the Turkish prison at Tura, there are 9000 prisoners there and more are coming to-night as there has been another Turkish defeat on the canal. After a nice ride but too many dismountings we arrived at Helouan at 2.30 pm and then had to ride a mile and a half from our bivouac to water our horses, Helouan is a great tourist resort but there is only one thing to see and that is the renowned sulphurous baths. We were all tired and slept well that night.\n","84":"\n\nAfter another long ride for water we left Helouan at 1.30 I am still riding the old draught and leading Sammy. The French residents of Helouan gave us a fine send off. Every camel I come too my mount goes one way & Sammy the other, so it is very pleasant. The ride along the Nile was very pretty with the feluccas on the water and the Pyramids of Sahara in the distance. Our food has been very scanty whilst on the march only two slices of bread each for all day but stew at night.\n\nWe arrived back at Maadi about 3 p.m and were not sorry. The 2nd Brigade have a fine stadium there and we witnessed some fine boxing there. The camp is much altered since we left it.\n","85":"\n\nSammy no better so I took him around by road with the transport through Cairo to Heliopolis whilst the bearers and one waggon went over the desert they had to fight the N. Zealanders before they could enter the camp, and they did this and got in easily, we arrived back at the camp about 2 p.m and had only just got in when the brigade followed. It was most successful turn out and the Brigadier was greatly pleased with our turn out and if the 1st L. H. Bde is not fit for the front no one is.\n\nWe rec mail (I got 5 letters) and pay also so after a shower and a feed we were as happy as could be, only I struck picquet, and I could hardly keep my eyes open.\n","86":"\n\nMorning spent in practising improvised stretchers by the aid of our saddle blankets and the stirrup irons in each corner. It is a splendid idea and a man can be carried a long way in one.\n\nWent to Cairo in the p.m with the intention of going to O.Rs but met some old friends who I have not seen since I left Aust, and as we were all hungry we decided to try a first class meal, we did so it costing us each 70 piastres.\n\nFive hundred maories are here now and are magnificently built men, when the Germans see them they will wonder what they have struck. In orders it was read the report on sir H. McMahon’s inspection they are very satisfactory.\n","87":"\n\nBeast of a day awful dust storm & millions & millions of locusts. C. P. under trying difficulties it was held in the cinema and during the sermon the roof was blown off so we had to return to our tents. I wrote home in the p.m. & went to O.’Rs at night.\n\nNews from the front lately is very scanty but satisfactory. has fallen & operations are still being carried out in the Dardanelles. Turkey I think is trying to sue for peace & Italy is just about to intervene. The 3rd Bde that left here arrived to our astonishment in England, it is to be hoped we go there too.\n","88":"\n\nBig review by Sir Ian Hamilton we had the morning off to polish up inspection at two, and we marched past the saluting base at 2.30 p.m. The whole division passed ahead of us and there was a sudden halt right in front of us, causing our line to break a little, but the General was heard to say “very good\" as we passed.\n\nSammy as usual went mad with excitement and just at the critical point, reared and plunged, and did not improve the dressing.\n\nThere was a raid in Cairo by a special picquet on all delinquents after 10-30 without passes and they arrested 55 including officers as well as three of our chaps and gaoled them for the night.\n","89":"\n\nA section went out with the Bde we exercised in the morning & did fatigue duties in p.m. An immense number of French soldiers have arrived at Alexandria and are camped there. Their destination is kept secret but can only be guessed. We are all getting sick of Egypt and are praying to get away even if it is only to another camp. \n\nThere is a rumor current that we bearers may lose our horses and ride in ambulance waggons like the English cavalry ambulance. Personally I think mounted bearers are a waste of horses and men, but is much preferable to walking like a field ambulance.\n","90":"\n\nB. Section went out in drill order to Kafr-el-Basha and halted amongst some trees at the canal, after watering & feeding horses we did some stretcher drill & loading waggons, I was a dummy, after dinner we swam our horses in the canal, and then came home. The bearers returned home almost all the way at a gallop and we had some troop drill on the way. Sammy rooted a lot and once nearly threw me. \n\nTook a walk into Heliopolis with a 3rd L. H. friend after tea, and had a big feed of ice cream, it is a great delicacy in this climate.\n","91":"\n\nOn Guard all day in the front of the camp whilst B. Section went out for a day’s drill.\n\nThe Signal & Wirless troupe went away to-day. Satisfactory news still reaches us from the front & Dardanelles.\n\nPart of Kitchener’s army have arrived here and are at Abbassia where the rest of the reinforcements are. We have drawn six more men from them. There have been a lot of deaths lately, mostly from pneumonia.\n\nA great concert in Y.M.C.A. although unprepared I was compelled to recite, and I rec the best reception I have yet had after three encores I was brought back twice, making five articles in all. I wrote a poem to-day “Why don’t they let us go and it is published in the Times.\n","92":" (Good Friday)\n\nAn all day holiday I went on all day leave to O’R’s and although they were fasting they prepared a great Easter dinner for me, after dinner I went to two “station of the cross days\" at the R. C. one in French and the other in Italian, it was novel for me and most impressive, I spent an enjoyable day but unfortunately Good Friday was a bad day for Australian troops here as there was a terrible riot in , it appears that a soldier the previous night was robbed of six pounds in a house of ill fame and next day with some mates went back for it, and instead was stabbed by the woman, this excited a mob and they started to wreck the house, they threw all the furniture out the windows and made a bon fire, then the trouble started. \n\nA light horse picquet had almost resumed order, when the hated English red caps rode down and drew pistols and fired straight into the crowd wounding several, one man is reported to have died since. This made the Aust’s mad, and they gave the red caps a great doing, and the cowards ran for their lives, with the mob chasing them. A lot of natives were hurt, but order was created by eight o’clock when a battalion from one camp arrived. All soldiers were sent home and Cairo after this will be out of bounds.\n","93":"\n\nIn morning cleaned saddlery and exercised horses, p.m. was fortunate enough to obtain a pass, five minutes before they were recalled. I went to Mena to see old mates and was astonished to see one brigade had gone and they were leaving all day and night and the coming week. They are going to Lemnos they think a Greek island in the Dardanelles. We will be I think the last to leave as the infantry will have to fight there way in . personally I think the L.H. will not be wanted very much in this war. We may go this week or we may stay here some time.\n\nI arrived into Cairo too late to go to my friends so came right home to camp. The cheering of the men as they were departing showed how eager they were to get into action.\n","94":"\n\nC. P. as usual Easter service had some visitors in the p.m. all is leave is stopped in consequence of riot.\n\nWrote home in the p. m. frightfully dusty day.\n\nAll the infantry from here are going this week but we are the last to go, even the 4th field amb that arrived seven weeks after we did are going before us. On picquet at night frightful dust storm I took bad, and could hardly finish my second shift, as a matter of fact I did fall asleep but awoke in time to call my next relief.\n","95":"\n\nBeing a brutal day with dust flying everywhere, I reported sick at the hospital, and when Dr took my temp, he at once ordered me into the Palace Hospital, in Heliopolis. I have a kind of influenza caused by the sand, and it is very prevalent lately. \n\nThe first thing I did when I arrived at the hospital was to have a good hot bath, and I felt cured as soon as I came out. I am in the best ward of all and have four fine sisters. My pulse is very low but I can eat all the splendid delicacies provided. The bed seems unnaturally soft and the food too good, as it is a great comparison with camp diet.\n","96":"\n\nMuch improved my temp has gone down and I am normal again. Am not allowed up yet but I wanted to smoke so badly that I sneaked out of the ward whilst the sister was not looking. \n\nEnglish ladies bring us flowers and any amount of papers and magazines, so we are well off if I was only allowed to smoke I could stop here for months. The food is splendid, cocoa, rice, milk, chicken, oranges being part of our daily diet. I am in that part of the building known as the Casino, and the fittings are more beautiful than can be imagined, everything is marble & granite & alabaster, and all the fittings are of native carved brass.\n","97":"\n\nAllowed up to-day, much improved pains still in my back, Sister put a large mustard plaster on and stood by & laughed whilst it burned. \n\nRec. mail in morning from H. E. & E. Had mates in as visitors, one brought me Cigarettes & money and another a neat parcel of writing pad envelopes, pen ink, chocolates tobbacco & cigarettes. It is good to know that even whilst you are sick there are mates who think so well of you.\n\nPart of the 4th Bde Infantry went to-day, but there is some stoppage on the route. Three fellows died to-day here, of pneumonia. I passed one poor chap as he was being taken to the mortuary with the Union Jack over his coffin and I thought what a fearful end in this God forsaken country and victory and fighting in sight.\n","98":"\n\nAllowed up nearly all day, and smoked and read in the sun on the piazza and beautiful gardens.\n\nAll leave is absaloutley stopped troops are not even allowed into Heliopolis. I send passes to my mates and they manage it that way. Wrote home to M & E. to-day. More deaths and military funerals, this country is playing havoc with the Australians, the desert is claiming all them as victims. Military funerals are very common now but none the less impressive and sorrowful. \n\nThe Band of the13th Batt played popular airs on the Piazza at night in camp we cursed them and their daybreak practice but here they seemed to play well, I think it is because we want to listen.\n","99":"\n\nGreatly improved, we were all moved into a big ward to-day called the convalescent ward. Consequently I have lost the nice little Sister. \n\nSome Daily Mails presented by the London War Associates came to hand to-day, one has an article of mine in. i am writing a copy of this diary for a friend but he is paying me well for it. As smoking is prohibited it must be done secretly, and every day there is a meeting in a snug retreat. As all the men are from different regiments you hear some funny yarns. There are a lot of old soldiers amongst them who have seen previous active service. The elected president of the society is a hard case, Scotchman, who rules an Irish sergeant continuously out of order. It is a case of who tells the biggest lie gets an iron cross. \n\nOf the Sultan to-day there was an attempted assassination and was unsuccessful.\n","100":"\n\nThe new ward is not as nice or the sisters are not as nice as the old one. We have twice the freedom and can walk out into the gardens for a smoke. Leave has been granted again for troops to visit Cairo but only 10% a night. \n\nMy pleurisy pains have become more acute but otherwise I am well, Capt. Hume Turnbull my dr says that they will pass away quickly.\n\nWe were all in bed at 8.30, lights out at 8 pm when we heard a lot of cheering, singing, & bands playing so we all jumped out of bed in spite of sisters threats and rushed down to the gate just in time to see the 4th Bde of Inf. Going away. A lot of our chaps belonged to it and were being left, and they seemed broken hearted over it however we gave them a cheer from the pyjama brigade. \n","101":"\n\nVisiting day I had a lot of mates in to see me from the Camp & Mena & Abbassia. One is a newly appointed W. O. of Abbassia Convalescent Camp and he told me that if I came out there he would give me an acting sergt’s position. \n\nI was very amused to hear more of “Sammy\" escapades. In my absence he had to be exercised so a big fellow volunteered to ride him and Sammy resented his weight and promptly threw him. Then a reinforcement rode him and he let him get a fair distance from the camp then Sammy threw him eight times before he arrived home.\n\nPart of the 14th Batt. Went to-night. Sister gets me doing part of her work now and for being obliging I am doing too much. In the p.m I took the pulse & temp of the whole ward (60) then made the charts out.\n","102":"\n\nNew sister allows me up all day and put me on the smoking list I take temps & pulses for her at 4 pm there are 57 to do.\n\nMet an old friend named C. B. today he was only two beds away & I did not know it. Good news from the front the crisis is rapidly approaching & I received two letters at night from M & E. satisfactory news. I cannot sleep so well at night as I am never tired enough, so about a dozen of us put on overcoats and sneak out in a summerhouse and yarn & smoke for a few hours. There is a party of old Indian & African service men, and their yarns are good enough to print.\n","103":"\n\nFearfully hot day, hot winds and muggy air, better in hospital than out in the desert. Just lay about in the shade of the trees of the garden all day. Fearful rumours have come to hand concerning the 3rd Brigade that went from here about three weeks ago, but as it is not confirmed I will wait before writing. Soldiering is the game to hear rumours they allways come straight from the heads or the front.\n","104":"\n\nI am beginning to get tired of this and anxious to get out again it is a peculiar trait that no how much an Australian soldier is satisfied he is always growling for something better. Had one of my front teeth filled to-day by resident dentist. \n\nWe all have to wear a badge on our arms now with L. D on light duty. This allows us to smoke and to wander about the grounds. A party went down from mena to Luna Park to convert it into a hospital for expected wounded. Satisfactory news comes from the Dardanelles and papers report Austria is suing for peace.\n","105":"\n\nTime beginning to drag, we are all on light duty in our ward now. Reports are going about that their has been a big action in the Dardanelles in which the 3rd Brigade Aust. Inf. Fared very badly so far it is not confirmed.\n\nOur surgical ward has done fine work here, some great operations have taken place.\n\nThe base desert hospital is now at Abbassia where the reinforcements are. This week I have written letters to all my friends in Aust.\n","106":"\n\nReceived some stray mail from Aust. Reports state that there is a big engagement on in Mesopotamia in which a lot of Aust. are engaged, but it is hardly probable that they are so far south. It seems that it will be some time before the light horse are wanted, as there is no use for cavalry in this war, at the front all the lancers & cavalry are fighting in the trenches. If they keep us here much longer they will have to stable the horses as the desert heat will be too much for them. \n\nMy Doctor Capt. Hume Turnbull said that I can go out on Sunday.\n","107":"\n\nOne hundred & sixty light wounded, sick & maimed are expected here to-night from Lemnos, I believe they are mostly frost bite but we will know more later news is kept very secretly since the Austs departed.\n\nReceived more stray mails this past week has been a splendid one for me. Paraded for my discharge to-day going out to-morrow, got drilled for first time to-day in the same old uniform that now seems part of our life. Had a few visitors Bob Ker and other L. H. mates also C. M. Lutherland came in to see me. Two charming ladies came with flowers to put in the wards and I helped them, one is a journalist so consequently I have an invitation to tea at Koubeik.\n","108":"\n\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent train came right up to the hospital gates last night utilising the tram track the guage being the same, there were nurses & orderlies aboard it, there were no very bad cases on mostly rheumatism and pneumonia, they say it rained at Lemnos all the time they were there and they only had bully beef & biscuits to eat.\n\nDischarged from hospital at four o’clock an escort came to meet me on arrival at the camp I got a great reception from my mates. The camp is quite deserted all the inf having gone only light Horse & a few inf reinforcements being here. There is a big barbed wire prison guard room built. \n\nReceived two more letters – strays E & G.\n","109":"\n\nSaw Camp Doctor he put me on four days light duty. It seems as if we will be here for some time all getting issued with helmets and summer clothing.\n\nReceived my back pay this morning. The camp and horse lines are altered now, drivers being one side bearers the other. The camp food is a great change to the hospital, I could hardly eat it. \n\nMiss Lyon one of the ladies I met in hospital an English journalist wintering here called to see me in the afternoon, I showed her around the camp then received a kind invitation to Madame Shakour Pashas house to tea. Her husbands position in Egyptian Army is equal to a General. Went to Picture theatre with Clive B at night.\n","110":"\n\nOn Police all day, the others exercised horses in the morning. We have all the 4th Field Amb fellows with us now that were in the hospital when the remainder went away, one of them was skiting about his riding so the transport sergeant asked me if he could ride Sammy for him, he did so but not for long, Sammy is the trial horse for the whole corp now, there are only three of us ride him willingly.\n\nHalf holiday in p.m. so prepared for eight days trek to-morrow. Being ill I am not going but am acting q.m. and living in the sergeants mess.\n\nReceived small mail at night and pay.\n","111":"\n\nReveille 5.30 they all left at 8 a.m. the whole brigade they are going to Maadi, Helouan Takara Pyramids then home in about eight days. \n\nThere are very few in camp only the Field Amb chaps and the tent division and hospital staff, I have to draw rations in the morning for the lot. The men pulled down all the tents and stacked them away in the mess room. \n\nI went to O’Rs at night and they gave me a very cordial reception first time there for nearly three weeks, brought home vegetables & luxuries for the mess there are only five of us and we mean to live well.\n","112":"\n\nUp before the Major again for forgetting to report when I came in last night escaped with a lecture.\n\nI am having a great time here with all the others away I dont care how long they stay away, we are living like fighting cocks on the best of everything and as much leave as we like. \n\nGreat news of a big Allied victory reached us it is in Flanders it seems now as if the allies have the enemy on the offensive. Have not heard anything concerning the Army that went away, save that the Bombardment of the Dard is progressing & the Turks are in full retreat in Mesopotamia.\n","113":"\n\nBought a fine ostrich boa which I sent to Mother I have written a lot of letters in the past few days.\n\nTwo sergeants returned from Helouan at night and went back later. They say that they are not having too good a time and envy us for the fine time we are having. C. B. & I went to O’Rs at night he was delighted to be able to speak to English people, it is reported that Cholera has broken out in some parts of Egypt if so it will be disastrous to us.\n","114":"\n\nAwfully hot day one of the worst we have yet had, flies are awful far worse than in Australia. I went to dance at Bulac at night only stayed few minutes then came home. The Greeks of Cairo are making a terrible fuss of Mr Venizelos the late Greek Minister here he is estimated as the national hero. The Grecian populace is going about crying Zeto Venizelos. It is a pity that Greece did not step in with the Allies. \n\nRode into the hospital to get some instruments for canine operation express by Capt Fraser, Professor Watson & Surgeon General Williams saw all my friends & nurses.\n","115":"\n\nAustralians made their historic landing at Gaba Tepe to-day. \n\nWorst day I have ever experienced hot wind tearing over desert at terrific rate, the flying sand almost cuts the face tents blown in all directions every thing covered in dust if you get out of the wind flies will eat you this is typical of Egypt.\n\nIn the p.m. went to O’Rs to get out of the desert for a while, found Cairo & Shoubra much cooler and hardly any wind although close the desert is about the worst place to be when the weather is hot & windy. The Veterinary Corp from Mena have come here now and are lying next to us they have done good work so far.\n","116":"\n\nMen expected home to-morrow all others on fatigue duties erecting tents etc. \n\nIn the p.m. I went out for a ride to the hospital first to see Sister O then on to Abbassia to the convalescent camp. A friend of mine is W. O. there. At night I went to O’Rs Gwen is teaching me French Verbs again, three times a week she has over thirty French pupils that she teaches English to, there is a great rush to learn English now. \n\nGreat news from the Dardanelles. The Allies have landed troops in three places in the Gallipoli peninsula, so the Aust will be part of them.\n","117":"\n\nMen returned home about 2 p.m and reported that they had a great time at Helouan, they returned from Helouan to Maadi on Monday night making record time under night marching order. They say that it was six days holiday, every day & night. They had leave and spent all their money so Helouan business people did well.\n\nSully was on picquet at night and he was knocked up and as I was fresh I did his first relief and let him turn in, he was very grateful.\n","118":"\n\nCleaned saddlery in the morning, inspection in p.m then fatigues.\n\nThe Aust are in action now under Sir Ian Hamilton the Allied troops have landed in three places, it is reported that the Austs landed under heavy fire and that there are heavy casualties, the wounded are expected here to-morrow so I will hear more.\n\nIn spite of the losses the Allies have gained a lot of ground inland capturing some good positions so there is a possible chance for us going after all.\n\nThursday, 29 April, 1915\n\nTrain loads of wounded arrived here all day (Palace H) from Gallipoli they report heavy casualties amongst the Aust all these however are of the 3rd Brigade Inf and the","119":" Field Ambulance. They say that out of a Batt of men only 300 odd answered the roll whilst the Ambulance was completely cut up, the Turks simply ignoring it when they went to pick up the wounded.\n\n3000 British losses are reported but as they are invading it must be expected, will have more to chronicle to-morrow. The hospital staff is doing great work at the Palace Hotel & Luna Park.\n","120":"\n\nExercised horses again.\n\nReports say that the Aust & British are doing wonderfully well at the Dardanelles, having gained over 20 miles. Wounded arrived all day it is a wonderful service they utilise the tram lines to run the train on right up to the hospital. \n\nAbout 10 p.m when all were in bed, a cry was heard “17 volunteers wanted to reinforce at the Dardanelles\". Ever man rushed down to the officer so they had to draw for it and 17 that is no-care sort of beggars got it, they were packing until 12 at night, we helping them.\n","121":"\n\nTransport came for the lucky 17 at 5.30 a.m. and we all turned out to give them a hearty send off although we were we gave them three hearty cheers and wishes for luck.\n\nMore wounded arrived to-day including Col Elliot (Pompey) and a lot of well known of their officers. Two Brigadiers were reported killed. They all sing the praises of the Australians & say that they are poor soldiers but they can fight. The Turk does not like a bayonet charge of Aust.\n\nWent to O’Rs at night, 3rd time this week they are delighted with the success of the Australians.\n","122":"\n\nas I expected volunteers were called to go and help at the Palace Hospital and relieve the orderlies that have been going for three nights without sleep. Ten of us volunteered I was one, firstly we erected a lot of beds at Luna Park and the Casino then back to the hospital and allotted to wards I was in Surgical A and all day was carrying patients in stretchers up to the operating theatre, I was knocked up by the time we finished then the Colonel asked us if we would care to stop here for a few days we all agreed so returned to camp for our kits then back only to find that one of us had to go on night duty we drew for it and although I never drew it I offered to do it.\n","123":"\n\nAll night long I was putting on foments and dressing wounds some of them are awful, the suffering I have seen to-day I will remember all my life. when day break came I was so exhausted that I could hardly drag one leg after the other, it was a hard but a good twenty four hours work.\n\nMonday\n\nSlept all day like a top, there have been no more wounded come in so things are easier most of the wounded are going to other hospitals this is just about full. Went on night duty again at 8 pm, The night sister is very nice and considerate.\n\nHave a new officer at Camp formally dentist N.Z. Lieut. McKenzie in place of Capt Ramsden who went to \n","124":"\n\nHad a good night, patients all slept well, there was a guard placed on the delirious man. Three more train loads of wounded came to Cairo, patients sent to Giza Anglo Egyptian and Kasr el Aini Hospitals. The suffering I see is awful, I am getting quite used to it now. I have eleven wounded to dress and one man with Rheumatic Fever, he is in frightful agony. Could not sleep during the day so went up to the camp only to learn that some of the men are going to day to Alex to in the transports. Sammy is very ill and is down at the Vet lines, he is not expected to recover, he has gone quite mad, I would not like to see him die as long as I lost him\n","125":"\n\nLast night I went on duty and then was informed that I had to go down to Luna Park for duty. There were 600 patients and only three men and one night sister to attend to them. I was run off my legs and to make matters worse a fellow that was mad through shrapnel wounds in the head escaped and we had to search with hurricane lamps for him, he was found under a bed stark naked. When I was relieved in the morning I was I was as tired as could be. At last the good news we are off at last although as Infantry. The men paraded and offered to go dismounted, it was a great sacrifice for a Light Horseman.\n","126":"\n\nOn day duty in morning, left hospital at 4 pm back to the camp, everywhere here is excitement, expect to go on Saturday. Horses went to Abbassia Remount depot only officers and transport horses remaining. Issued with all sorts of Inf. Kit. Pay day consequently a lot celebrated it being last night on leave in Egypt. Went to O.Rs to bid farewell to some of the best friends I have ever known, it was a tearful good bye, such as I will always remember. The old corp has greatly altered there being 17 strangers who have come as reinforcements, we hardly know there names.\n","127":"\n\nHad to pack kit bags and saddles before 9 am, it is funny to watch soldiers packing, we are only allowed one change, and the men try to smuggle all kinds of things. I was detailed off to act as baggage and took all the kit bags down to Helmich and put them on the train. I rode home in the lead, it may be my last ride for some time. Wrote a lot of letters to home & friends, farewell concert at night in the Y.M.C.A. We are going to be issued with knapsacks, we are all laughing at the idea of walking, and wondering how long we will last on a long march.\n","128":"\n\nOn fatigues all day striking camp & loading wagons, issued with knapsacks which we have to put our overcoats etc in. Nearly all the lads celebrated the night had a concert in the mess room one of our more lads had obtained a commission in 6th L.H. Left camp at marching in front of waggons singing & whistling all kinds of songs, hymns to ragtime. A lot of people turned out to wave farewell, passing the hosp we gave a cheer and the wounded answered from their beds. Arrived Cairo 2.45 am, put horses & waggons on train then ourselves, tired and sleepy, it was our first march and the knapsacks seemed to cut right into shoulders. Promptly fell asleep in the old carriages provided.\n","129":"\n\nAfter a long tedious journey arrived at Alex wharf and straight away loaded from the train to transport, she was the B15 Kingstonian she has been carrying troops since the war started and has had two trips to the Dard. and back with Turkish Prisoners she was in a dirty filthy stinking condition. The N.Z. R. Sig & Eng and L. Horse on board. We had not finished loading late at night when it was decided to leave some of the waggons behind as it is impossible to effect a landing. grave rumours are going about concerning the landing, it is said that there has been a serious reverse, and that we have stiff work ahead of us. The N.Z.N.C. are aboard and are not wearing their To-date we have no fresh orders concerning the move.\n","130":"\n\nLeft Alex at nine am had to leave four of the waggons behind as it will be impossible to land them. we expect to land under fire. Beautiful weather, sea very calm it is a good boat but a filthy one. There are 60 horses & 500 men on board. Issued with puttees in place of leggings. This is another thing a L.H. man does not like parting with. The food is real active service bully beef & biscuits three time a day, had to change our Egyptian money into English losing 1\/- in the £ So far we are not armed \n about it as the Turks take no notice of the Red Cross using it as a target.\n Reports state that they are very proud of the Australians initial success. \n\nThe Aust submarine A-31 sunk in the Dardanelles. \n","131":"\n\nBeautifully calm weather scarcely a ripple passed the islands of Scarpanto and Rhodes Islands & other smaller ones. I am mess orderly for the trip over. that the drivers will be bearers. The W.O. asked me to go into the on the hospital staff I have declined as I want to There is a terrible lot of gambling done on the boat We had an impromptu concert at night the sailors playing well on the violin and concertina A Big french Warship circling. We expect to see a big battle & the bombardment when we arrive \n\nArrival at the Dardanelles\n","132":"\n\nabout 6 pm we heard firing and as it was dusk we could distinguish Asia minor on our right. By looking straight ahead we could see a number of battleships firing at a large fort then flash upon flash came from the dark grim hills. This was our artillery firing indirectly at the enemy who are now inland a good way with the Australians engaging them. It must have been a night attack by us for we heard rifle and machine gun fire mixed with the heavy boom of artillery and the still louder roar of the dreadnought. There were 13 gunboats there and they were all firing, we were only about six miles off it was a sight that I would not have missed for life it was wonderful – awe – inspiring. We anchored alongside another transport and a hospital ship and as the battle had ceased and no lighters came we all turned in for it was a cold night.\n\nBombardment of the Dardanelles\n","133":"\n\nHeavy firing all night big battle in the hills boats bombarded incessantly. Reported that a battleship the Goliath was torpedoed not far from us and sank with 600 souls on board. The boats bombarded and our artillery also a strong position after an aeroplane ascended and reconnaisanced the position narrowly escaped being hit on many occasions. This was in full view of us. It was a wonderful scene and beggars description. About noon we all moved down about ten miles to where the Aust. landed quite close to the famous hill, an observation balloon went up from a boat and the Queen and Agamemnon fired incessantly over the hill. \n\nA lot of came alongside and said that the casualties to date were over 7,000 including many big officers. The New Zealanders disembarked and all the details, they are going into the big trench where the are holding the Turks waiting for our rear guard to advance. Orders came that all horses had to be returned to Alex as it was impossible to land them as they were useless. The drivers have to go with them. The usual cry was ‘Curse the horses’. We are all cursing the day we ever saw a horse, they have been our drawback – to cap all now the bearers are going on to a hospital ship in the morning after going having to be neutral as it is a well known fact that \n","134":"\n\nAll lights were extinguished last night as they are in dread of a submarine that is about. Destroyers are hunting everywhere but she cannot be located. There was a terrific battle during the night on the big hill a big victory for us or a serious reverse. The battleships were firing right on to the beach so we do not know the reason why. A lighter came alongside and we have loaded all our hospital equipment on board and we were fully dressed to go on to the hospital ship, when word came that the lighter had to return to the beach at once and our boat with us on board had to retire to Lemnos immediately, we had to move all the stuff up by ropes against orders, we got most of it up, but the lighter went away with a lot of our stores and medical equipment on. This we will never see again but if wounded are coming in on the lighter they will bless us as there was a lot of medical comforts and provisions on the lighter. \n\nWe proceeded out of the danger full speed with two destroyers clearing the way for us, shells were bursting in the water only a mile away from us, we were all pleased however that we did not have to go on the hospital ship and be broken off from our old mates, we do not know the intentions but we have been right up to the fight and had a wonderful view and had to leave too soon, as it became dangerous for us We arrived at Lemnos and found a lot of other transports there in the beautiful harbour. They all have nurses on board and are like us. There are a lot of cruisers here as well as the now famous Queen Elizabeth, she is a beauty. The hospital ship Talima followed us in so we are all in dread of going on her yet. It is reported that there are now three Austrian submarines about brought in sections The harbour is netted in on account of them.\n","135":"\n\nReports state that during the night two of the Austrian submarines were caught by means of a strategic trick . The big battle that we watched on the hills the other night resulted in an Allied victory. Three lines of trenches were recaptured by the British & French’s. Early in the morning the Col and Capt Ramsden came on board from the Galeka cheers were given for the Capt and groans for the Col. We then informed that we had to go on the Galeka, the bearers and tent division and thus separate us from our mates and drivers and break up the old coy that we were all so proud and fond of. We boarded a lighter after lunch and said goodbye to our old pals, they cheered us to the echo climbing up the rigging and everywhere is was a happy farewell but it was a sentimental one as it was the separation of firm friends of nine months acquaintance. \n\nThen we went across to the Galeka and boarded her and found the on board her they must have been there ever since they left but they were reinforcements for the 3rd Field Ambulance that got completely wiped out in the big fight. We found the ship to be everything that can be desired she is spotlessly clean with four decks she was a passenger steamer to Africa and carries three classes. We find that she is not a hospital ship but a depot for medical details. there are men of other medical on her and we were to be drawn as details whenever we are wanted we may go in a day we may go in a mos time but we are better off than the drivers who have to return to Alexandria. Thank God we have no horses on board this ship it the one bright thing about it my mate and I did was to have a look around and pinched a side of bacon. it will be a change to bully beef and rock biscuits.\n\n \n","136":"\n\nThere is a dummy warship being made alongside us out of an old it is a wonderful imitation it is to be used to the Turkish fire. All day long we have been taking men on board from other boats, mostly medical chaps but a lot of Inf. Most were wounded in the first fight and have been to Malta and are now convalescent. a few weeks fighting and a man becomes a real scarecrow. They are a disreputable dirty bearded lot but gallant heroes in spite of their present ragged appearance. They are all going back to the hill at Gallipoli. I met some of my old mates among them one had a list of the killed and wounded of the 3rd Battalion. Two of my oldest school friends are amongst the killed. A few of the light horse brigade to which we are attached came on board slightly wounded being picked off by snipers. They reported that they were all in a big trench just holding the Turks in another not fifty yards away, snipers playing havoc if they expose themselves. \n\nThe British and French are hounding the Turks on three sides, so there is a big battle to take place shortly and there is a chance that we may be there as we were due to sail to-night but it will be morning before we do. Those that have returned lately say that the stink from the bodies lying in the valley is awful and unless they drive the Turks back they are afraid of cholera breaking out, all the men are lousy, this it cannot be helped, war has to be seen to be realized, wounds are not the worst fact to contend with. Submarines, cruisers & dreadnaughts are patrolling backwards & forwards all day\n","137":"\n\nArrived at the Dardanelles again at Carpa Tepe went right up to the hill where fighting is going on and all the Turks are entrenched the other side there is one gun on the hill that cannot be located, this is a disappearing gun and is firing all day. a cruiser had just moved out of the way when four shells dropped in the very spot where she had just left then the Queen started firing from her starboard and her bows she got the range on two villages two miles distant, she rained shell after shell on them and finally hit a magazine and there was a terrific explosion and the was soon in flames apparently this had been used as an observation station. we were right alongside the jetty and every shot that hit we cheered to the echo it was a great sight. \n\nAbout 6.30 pm four shells dropped quite close to us in the water then the battleship Prince of Wales spoke with her 12 inch guns and the shore battery was soon silenced. The two villages burned all night. All the convalescent Inf went ashore at night to rejoin their regiments. Three of our chaps smuggled on board with them, I was too late as officers were watching. All the men were only slighted wounded and eager to get back again. I am looking after the in the galley for the troops and am living well, I cook bacon spuds etc and our mess is called the . We are off again in the morning this time to Imbros it is all ossis , we cannot get away from ossis. \n","138":"\n\nArrived at Imbros found it to be another island inhabited by one light house, all the other boats arrived here as we are safe from shells but submarine precautions are taken. The joke of the lot was when the old with drivers came alongside. None of us know our future intentions but we are having a fine holiday on this boat away from horses, all we do is read sleep play cards and yet we are supposed to be on government rations, but we are living like saloon passengers. I cooked a leg of ham for dinner, it was a triumph men ate the lot. We hear that the British are doing well in the war of the hill but the French are no good at all twice they have lost positions what the British have won. The Indians are doing good work with their mountain batteries. \n\nWe had a lecture on Ceylon at night by Chaplain Miles we have all the chaplains on board, little Capt Dexter went with the Inf the night before, the men adore him, he did better work with the wounded than all the doctors, dressing wounds and , he worked 2 days and 2 nights.\n","139":"\n\nLeft Imbros for Carpa Tepe the scene of operations where there was a terrific battle raging. The Turks have been heavily reinforced and they attacked the Auss position repeatedly only to get driven back and mown down in thousands. The slaughter was terrific on one occasion the Austs allowed the Turks to approach within 30 yards before firing shots then set the Light Horse machine guns on them with fearful results. The Turks shrapnel fire was very effective and settled a lot of our fellows. We got orders to convert our boat into a hospital ship and go right in and get wounded. we went right in and were at once greeted by a shell right across our bows. . \n\nWe brought the bad cases off the lighter up in a sling and cradle and before we had one lot’s wounds dressed another load would arrive. We all worked like niggers, I was stretcher bearing and laying out beds on the deck and feeding the patients before I was called into the operating theatre, it was a regular shambles. I witnessed twenty amputations of arms legs etc as well as the removal of eyes and organs. I saw the lot and it was a pleasure to watch Col Ryan and Capt Fiaschi with the knife. Wounded kept arriving until after midnight including Turkish prisoners, they are cared for the same as our own. I was detailed off to sit up all night in a cabin with a N.Z. Lieutenant Logan who had a compressed fracture of the skull, the operation did not succeed and after a night of struggling and agony the poor brave young fellow died in my arms at 5 a.m. without gaining consciousness.\n","140":"\n\nHad a well earned sleep during the morning, more wounded came aboard, we now have all the patients wounds dressed and the work is now to feed and attend them. The arrangements are very poor as everything came with a rush and our officers being doctors of course could not found a system so we have to go on working day and night until they do. More died today and were taken out to sea to be buried, four in all. Every man is in sympathy with ambulance man Simpson who has been bringing wounded down the hill to the beach night & day since the fight started, he used a little black donkey and he was under fire all the time. \n\nHis boast was that he could not be hit, his escapes were miraculous but at last he was shot dead through the head. He has been mentioned in dispatches. The fight still rages on the hills at night. The Turks have been reinforced and are doing the attacking, and are being mown down like sheaves. The Austs are holding the position wonderfully, some of the Royal Marines the pick of the British Army were sent up to relieve them. looking at the pos. they refused to take it saying they could never hold it but our boys did and are doing still although badly in need of a spell out of the trenches.\n\nFriday, 21 May.\n\nThe 13 of our chaps that were transferred to the 3rd Fld Ambulance left to go in to the Luxor another hospital to-day they are not as well off as us. Left to-day back to Imbros stayed there all day, three more deaths. There was a glorious battle on the right of the hill about nine p.m. last night, the flashes of shrapnel Artillery and the British howitzers illuminated the sky occasionally the Man of War Bacchanty spoke and with effect. Three of the deadliest Turkish batteries were silent. The whole trouble so far with us has been espionage. Four light horse interpreters who joined at Heliopolis proved to be spies they were caught signaling to the Turks and were promptly shot. \n\nA splendid report was brought to us by a man of war man to-day, he said that the whole of the Turkish flank had surrendered led by a German Major General, if this is right it is a great move for us. this flank is on our left and is held by the 1st L.H. Brigade and the N.Z. The Light Horse are proving themselves every bit as good as the infantry while their machine guns are superior. In the trenches it is quite safe and the wounded say we are in more danger out here than they are in their dugouts.\n","141":"\n\nLeft Imbros back to the base Lemnos, found the harbor full of boats as well as the entire French Fleet of battle ships It was a fine sight as we passed them, we anchored right in the harbor and the big liner Franconia drew right alongside us and took off all our slightly wounded and convalescents, when they are better she will take them back to the front. Our boat is taking only the serious cases, we are to receive 35 more here. Two more died last night one a Turkish officer. Once I could not look at the dead but now I can dress them fix them up and carry them anywhere. News comes that Major General Bridges is killed, this is our","142":" General we have lost. the Turks casualties are about five to our one. I have a good ward now a few light cases mostly nervous breakdowns from the effect of bursting shells. Since the Turks came aboard every man has become lousy with body lice off the dirty devils.\n","143":"\n\nThe N.Z. went ashore a base hospital leaving us only to look after all the patients to Alex. There is nothing to make us remember Sunday there is no service we are all to busy attending wounded & sick. A party went ashore to-day to bury some dead and procure stores, as we are badly off for provisions. Lemnos is a quaint beautiful place with a fine harbour. There are 17 villages in it all occupied by Greek peasants who wear typical costumes. \n\nThe French reinforcements are there as well as all the Indian Transports. The French uniforms are mostly a ridiculous lot all colours scarlet to sea blue even red tassels on their boots, this is how they go to war. The allies are holding their own and are steadily driving the Turks back little by little in land but an enormous toll of Dead Turks to mark the victory. I am in charge of a good ward now about 40 convalescents and light serious cases pneumonia & rheumatic fever I am becoming a first class nurse and can take the most serious cases. I have to feed four of them with the spoon.\n","144":"\n\nMore patients arrived on board to-day mostly cases that are being sent back to Alexandria for treatment. I got the bulk of them, have now 46 to look after. The Allied fleets are steadily forcing the Dardanelles but Constantinople is a long way off yet. It is the general optimism now that the British bit off more than they can chew in assaulting Gaba Tepe without more Navy preparation and Headquarters are being blamed for the heavy loss of Australians as they had no reinforcements and therefore had to retire over three miles of won ground, if reinforcements had been there the rest would have been much easier also they would have had the guns that are doing the damage now, the Aust has won the title of the White Gurkhas even the original acknowledge this, they are cruel, heartless fighters but worth two Tommies when fighting the Turks, the British are very jealous of our success.\n","145":"\n","146":"\n\nDads birthday We hear that Italy has joined At night all lights are exting and we are taking a different route to the usual, we are hugging the Greatian Coast through the archipelago. The scenery is beautiful, the reason for this is that we fear that a stray submarine that supposed to be about, all the life boats are in readiness for emergency. The artillery are making good progress especially the Indian Mtd Battery the others are just entrenched holding the position until the enemy are driven up from Cape Hellas. Things are much more settled now and the troops are being well looked after, reinforcements keep arriving.\n","147":"\n\nNo land in sight all day. This boat although a pass. steamer cannot do better than about ten knots. We are having an easier time now as there are only dressings to do all my bad patients are doing well and on the road to recovery. By wireless word has come that they have captured the big German siege gun that was doing so much damage at Gaba Tepe. I have one of the interpreters who is being sent back in my ward he says that the Turks are willing to surrender but are being driven into by German Officers. All these German Off. wear dead Aust uniforms and speak good English and it is hard to find who is who.\n","148":"\n\nArrived in Alexandria and got off all our patients the slightly wounded & sick going to the others to various hospitals, we were pleased to be back in a city again and read the back papers with interest. After tea when the last patient had gone we all had a massed parade under Helsham before the Col and demanded an explanation why we a L.H. F.A. should be on a hospital ship when our place was with the brigade. The Col made a most unsatisfactory explanation saying it was not his wish etc and that he would rather be in the firing line, then our popular little Major spoke up and strongly criticised the Col and as much as said that if the Col would not he would apply to HQ. himself to take us back. The Col was badly squashed and the men dislike him more every day. Went ashore at night for a look round and a feed and then met a few of the drivers they are back now and are bivouacing at Victory Beach \n","149":"\n\nThe Majestic has also paid her toll in the Dardanelles we learn that the Triumph sunk position that we occupied. After cleaning up fatigues we were all paid and went ashore and had a great time. We met all our drivers and had a great reunion dinner. They are all bivouaced at Ramleh and are having a great time surfing and swimming horses. Alexandria is full of soldiers wounded French Zouaves English Aussies & N.Z. and American tars of the cruisers Caroline & Des Moines the Aust have no time for them and there have been a few fights. There was a big French festival for the Red Cross to-day opened by the Sultan. Cabled home telling I was safe. when we arrived back we found our boat had gone and we had to hire a bum boat and row out and find her. There have been strong reinf. at the Dardanelles in view of the big attack this week.\n","150":"\n\nAll day leave we journeyed out to the famous Ramleh Beach where the British, French, Indian and Australian transport horses were camped. We went to the drivers of our ambulance and after a good dinner spent the afternoon surfing in the sea. They have a great time horses is all they do. The ride out on a double decked tram is exhilarating. The cultivated scenery being magnificent. We came back to Alex for tea and then spent an enjoyable evening only as soldiers can when they have plenty of money. If we had one we must have had twenty different we had tars french soldiers with their ridiculous uniforms and others with us.\n","151":"\n\non guard all day on the gangway went ashore at night returned early. The weather is very hot and oppressive. We now learn that our boat had been mentioned in dispatches on account of our trip to the shore under shell fire. One of our boats the E11 ran right up the Dardanelles and bombarded Constantinople firing several torpedoes and sinking two Turkish Tramps. More prisoners keep arriving and as their is a big attack expected by us this week we hope to finish them from Cape Hellas through Krithia and Bokka right up to Gaba Tepe where all the main forces are . The French are doing most of the attacking From Cape Hellas one big now and I think we are way to Constantinople or Istamboul as the Turks call it. Wrote short letter home.\n","152":" June,1915\n\nWe left the Galeka after dinner and transferred to the Itonius which is going back to Lemnos and the Dardanelles with a load of convalescents British, Aust, NZ French Zouaves Indians Senegalese, there will be a big cargo on board as there is a load of rails on apparently they are going to put a railway line down somewhere. The load is a large one of the B. India Line with a Lascar crew. We will be a mixed lot There has been a further advance by the Allies at Gaba Tepe and Ache Baba. Went ashore for a walk and a feed as we will soon be back to the iron rations.\n","153":"\n\nFatigues all the morning, unloading, went on board the lighter after dinner and were sorry to leave the Galeka, she is a very decent boat. Arrived at the Itonius, found her to be a big boat but dirty. There is a heavy cargo on board rails etc. There are 1,500 on board and only accommodation for 900 so we are pretty crowded. They were just lying on the deck anywhere we have the most mixed lot imaginable every regiment that one can think of to cap all about five am a train load of Egyptian engineers arrived under an armed guard as the last lot they tried to ship bolted as soon as they saw the wounded they are a cowardly lot. Just as we were about to sail an order came that A section had to go on another boat, we were all disgusted for one thing it was it was another split and moreover they took the Major with them and he will fight to get them again into the firing line but we with the Colonel suffering from cold feet have only a poor chance. There are only about ten of the original that enlisted at B. Meadows in B. Sect. now all the others are reinforcements.\n","154":"\n\nThis boat makes good speed when we got under way we found that two of our chaps were missing having gone with A Sect. I would have gone to if I could have found my pay book. It is amusing to walk through the various decks and see the rainbows of colour. The French uniforms made from the palest of blue to the most glaring of red trousers, even to the tassels on their shoes, everything for show. I have been detailed off to assist to the hospital whilst on board. I have been informed that there are stripes waiting, if offered I am going to refuse them, for conscientious reasons. We have a lot of fine mules on board belonging to the A.S.C. also French officers . We will know our future intentions when we arrive at Lemnos.\n","155":"\n\nReceived three bed patients to-day. I also assist in the dispensary, with the medical nursing knowledge I have gained I will be a first class quack by the time I get back which I hope will be in Nov. The food is a little better on this boat but the accomodation is poor. I had an amusing experience in the middle of the night. Owing to my speaking Arabic I had during the day been conversing with some of the Egyptian sergeants during which I told them my name, well about two a.m. I heard a knock at my cabin and it was one of the sergeants, he cried “ Morris Effendi, \" I went down and found the man suffering from colic, so I fixed him up and they tried to show their gratitude every way. I refused it so Capt Fowler who they spurned they had no in him, but because I spoke their language, I was one of them.\n","156":"\n\nArrived at Lemnos about 9 p.m. all the way in the harbour French warships saluted and cheered when they saw our French soldiers were on. The same demonstration from British tars and coloured troops. The harbour is full of warships and troopships including the giant Mauritania. Lemnos has changed since we were here last, once what were bare hills are now camps. There must be nearly 50,000 troops here. General Wallace who came over with us went ashore soon after we landed. we have to wait instructions. Lord knows what our next move is. So far Roumania has not come in & America has funked it, but we are still Turks at Gaba Tepe & Achi Baba.\n","157":"\n\nAt ten am we got word that we had to be ready at two to leave the boat, but two passed and eventually we stayed on all night, it is like most of our orders. All the French troops went off to rejoin their units before reinforcements. We are steadily advancing from Krithia but Achi baba has not fallen yet, engineers of every allied nationality are being hurried there so it is expected that there will be a big engineering feat shortly I think the only way to take the hill will be to blow part of it up. Still on duty my three patients are now on the mend but two will be sent back to Eng. medically unfit.\n","158":"\n\nDuring the day the three men that bolted and went ashore at Gaba Tepe were brought back, they had been stretchers bearing from the firing line to the beach and doing great work yet the Col gave them 28 days detention. They told us all the latest news including the rumour that on Sunday night Sed el Bahr & Achi Baba were taken by the British and lost again with heavy casualties through the French retreating when hardly pressed. A party of us rowed back to the Galeka to get stores and there we saw the remnants of A section the other half going on the Canada under Major Helsham. The coy is now split into 4 sects A,B,C,D transports it is disgusting the whole brigade is singing out about the way the Col treats us, but we have to grin and bear it and warm his cold feet.\n","159":"\n\nHad fine concert on promenade deck at night promed by the officers I got a . I frankly liked the Englishmen as an . Left the boat to go ashore at last minute a bag full of old mail came for us it was a Godsend I got several letters & a paper some fellows got none. I always feel sorry for them. letters from home are the greatest blessing on active service. After drifting around the harbour in a lighter we finally landed and found tents already pitched on the top of a hill with No 2 Stat. Hosp. We had to unload etc and by this time it was tea, after tea we were paid a small advance and allowed down into the village, more about this later. we are right on the sea and will be able to have any amount of swimming. Three lines of Trenches have been taken on the road to Achi Baba.\n","160":"\n\nIt blows like the Devil here we get full strength as we are on top of the hill. We have a dip every morning as soon as we get up. we are allowed to sleep in till seven o’clock this is a luxury. We are camped on top of the hill of Mudros and behind us is the village thousands of years old and still the same with the quaint houses and greek peasant costumes. The Capital of Lemnos is eighteen miles away, the total population is 25,000 with about the same number of troops, French and British. It is going to be a permanent base and the Egyptian Eng are making roads, but the chief drawback is the water supply, what there is is of bad quality and we are only allowed about a pint a day & that boiled.\n","161":"\n\nWhilst the others went for route march in a strong wind fatigue the Col & two sergeants went to Gaba Tepe to get the mails. The other officers have been chaffing him and he has plucked up Dutch courage. The place had been condemned as a base, Imbros & Narselles going to be the next, there is scarcely any water here and what there is is bad, Typhoid being very common a lot of the men have developed it. The next tent to ours is a mortuary and every day five or six bodies are brought over for burial from the hosp ships wrapped in a union Jack for a decent but crude burial on land a rough cross is put up to denote the sleeper underneath. It is impossible to get good feed here, only fish & spaghetti reeking with olive oil and garlic.\n","162":"\n\nA few days ago a German aeroplane came over and dropped bombs in the French & Greek Camp without doing any damage. The Greeks were very indignant and some ran amok and did serious damage amongst the Turkish prisoners of who we have a lot here. the next camp to us is the R.A.M.C. and adjoining them are the Indians, it is a curious thing that they have a separated fence for the cooks as if a white man’s shadow falls on their food they throw it away. Things are very quiet at Gaba Tepe but they are slowly advancing at Cape Hellas. every day we receive sick men from the trenches, it is reported that enteric fever has broken out badly at Gaba Tepe. a few nights ago we attacked Achi Baba without avail but the Turks lost 23,000 men & yet it did not fall.\n","163":"\n\nThe Col & party returned to-day from Gaba Tepe and brought some mail back, they relate all sorts of adventures and we are told that the Col showed disgusting cowardice under fire, he refused an offer to take charge of the evacuating zone of an Inf Bde preferred to have his corp scattered. The greatest surprise of the lot was when he brought back our W.O. S.M. Lacy, the last we saw of him was that he was in a hospital at Heliopolis, but in the meanwhile getting better. he returned to the front and worse luck back to us. They are still steadily advancing from Cape Hellas but all is quiet at Anzac which has been named for those that are holding it, Aust N.Z. Army Corp.\n\nJust after we came up from our swim and finished breakfast we were surprised to hear a loud report on rushing out we found that there a was a German Aeroplane overhead and it had dropped a bomb in the very spot where we had been bathing. he dropped two more without effect although they both landed close to us. Then our warships commenced firing. he circled around out of range twice then as one of our shots went close he made off. One of our trawlers was sunk by a floating mine just outside the harbour. We went for a route march into the country in the morning and enjoyed it then returned to find that we had to shift camp as our tents were wanted by wounded so we were on fatigue all the pm erecting tents etc down next the R.A.M.C. A pleasant surprise was another big bag of mail. The latest I got seven letters and eight papers, it has been a great week for us. They have heard in Aust about our lads on","164":" days after the first fight. \n","165":"\n\nTwenty thousand Scottish reinforcements have arrived at Cape Hellas in Kilts and plaid trousers. I had a rather exciting adventure to-day, I was told to take four bags of the drivers to the headquarters boat the Aragon. I left the camp at 4 pm and went over in a Navy pinnace, delivered my charges then had to wait for a boat to take me back, after an hour’s wait three chaps from the No 2 S. Hosp arrived in a sailing cockleshell manned by two Greek natives. At their request I went with them for a trip around the harbour visiting all the transports with reinforcements and meeting a lot we knew. it was nearly dark when we left the Seane Choan to get back to the jetty, then our troubles started, we were nearly run down by a transport and a destroyer missing the former by a few feet, it was miraculous then a squall got up and the Greeks lost their heads our tiller broke and they let the mainsail go and we were carried right out into the ocean it took us two hours to get home, how we did it I know not, but we were wet through to the skin with spray, making for Woffer \n","166":"\n\nTwo night ago a trawler was sunk by a floating mine just outside the harbour only one was lost we took the survivors in and reclothed them. All we do all day is swim, eat, gamble & sleep and wander over this quaint but beautiful historic island, we are having an ideal holiday but it hurts to know that only a few miles away our mates are getting knocked down, but our Capt returned from Anzac to-day and said that we would only be in the way as there was not enough work to do for those that were there were four ambulance corps on the beach just waiting & laying off and twice they have had their tent division shelled from Achi Baba, the Austs are still holding out and enjoying it but dead Turks accumulated every night, Achi Baba has not fallen yet, it is considered a 2nd Gibraltar. The advance from Cape Hellas is slow but sure. \n","167":"\n\nThey have got us doing all the fatigues for other hospitals now, and we buck against it, we are doing everything from digging graves down the cemetery to tent erecting for the No 2 S.H. Wireless news says that we lost another cruiser near Austria – the Dublin – things are still quiet at Anzac but this week there is going to be a big attack, a 2nd Waterloo. The sooner we get off this island the better as we are liable to contract more serious danger than the firing line, since we have been here every man has become lousy from the Col downwards, no matter how often you wash & change clothes they get just as bad the whole island is creeping. The Turks attacked at Gaba Tepe lost 10,000 men. \n\n \n","168":"\n\nA bold move was made to-day by the W.O. who strange to say has altered since he left camp. He approached the Col with the suggestion that Capt Fowler & he should take twelve men & NCOs and land at Gaba Tepe and risk being sent back if not, and they succeed, the rest will follow in 48 hrs time with stores & equip. The Col agreed and it was decided that they should draw lots for the twelve to go, once I knew they were drawing lots for it I gave up all hope and as usual my name never came out of the hat. then one man being sick I had a 2nd chance and again futile so I have to remain behind, the others went in high spirits at four pm. It is just my damnable luck the same in camp when drawing for picquet I drew the worst in 13 weeks.\n","169":"\n\nA party hired a native mule cart and drove out to Castro the capital of Lemnos, eighteen miles away and spent an enjoyable but uncomfortable day in their rough carriage. I was so annoyed and depressed on account of being unlucky re the Anzac party that I could not get the heart to go, so I stopped home and did the cooking for the remainder. I rather pride myself on my cooking now in fact what I have not learnt to do about domestic duties is not worth learning, from serving to nursing. Last week the enemy tried to reinforce from Mudros but Artillery was played on them with disastrous loss to the Turks.\n\nHow do I get rid of this line???\n","170":"\n\nI had occasion to go down to the jetty and was surprised to see a lighter coming alongside with our fellows on back from Anzac on arrival there they reported and were told to go back from where they came from so back they came to Red Cross Island as it is called altogether there are over thirty Red Cross Units ashore; there are too may A.M.C. there already they are falling over each other there is nothing to do we are running more danger remaining here from fevers etc than at Anzac from Turks fire, so impregnable is our position. The Tommies lost a trench near Krithia but regained it with heavy loss to both sides we are getting the slight cases on the Island.\n","171":"\n\nThe Col lined us up to-day and spoke rather sharply about so many of us applying for transfers, he said they are absolutely unobtainable and that to-morrow we in conjunction with the RAMC start a convalescent hospital until we receive further orders he told us to go about our work cheerfully as he was doing the men bitterly resent it and have good reason to but he has the whip hand for orders are orders. About a thousand sick and slightly wounded arrived here at dusk for the various hospitals, mostly British but a few Aust, the Tommy may be a good soldier but the average are so dense that it is painful to talk to them.\n","172":"\n\nOn Fatigues all day erecting new camp for hospital with the Tommies it is a fine site far better than our present right on the beach and with two wells handy, it was a hot day and everything had to be carried on stretchers as we have no transport. We rec another mail today only a small one I did best of all with five letters. All the papers have details of our first landing and we cannot understand the paucity of the casualty lists as they are publishing only a few every day when in reality there are thousands and men have been dead for two months and up till May 8th their names had not even appeared.\n","173":"\n\nMothers birthday\n\nWish her many happy returns of the day only hope I will be back soon to do so. The men were on fatigues all day in a broiling sun, building incinerators and straightening up the camp. Everything is now complete and we are receiving patients every day. xxxx is our recreation it is in the famous Aegean Sea we xxxxxx about there daily, and are all as brown as berries. There is no doubting that Mudros is a beautiful place if the beauty is looked for it is ancient natural beauty, the fields are tilled and cultivated by peasants the women working in the field in their quaint costumes even to the oxen drawing the plough and xxxx\n","174":"\n\nWe had a pleasant awakening this morning by a sergeants voice – Come on get up you all have to be on the jetty at 9-30 so go on to the Scotian for duty. Every man jumped up and we got the stores etc down in record time, a torpedo boat towed us over and we hauled our stores up by hand this finished we sat down to the best meal we have had since we left the Southern after dinner we had to put 200 mattresses & pillows in slips and prepare beds as we expect a lot of wounded on board, this was hardly done when they commenced to arrive, and without a hitch they were promptly attended to, fed, and put to bed. As usual my luck caused to be on night duty first night.\n","175":"\n\nWounded and sick kept arriving all day in batches of a hundred at a time, we worked like niggers, as soon as we got one lot fixed up another 100 or so would arrive, just about meal time we had to feed them and then do the washing up, it was just Hell, talk about the parable of the fishes and the multitude, it was nothing to this, there were twelve of us to feed 800 odd all ravenous and they got three course dinner at that. We worked up till nine at night when we received our last batch of 60 bad stretcher cases, by the time we finished with them our legs & feet were just aching, I had done 18 hrs without sitting down, we sailed at 10 p.m. – Thank God.\n","176":"\n\nBoat making great speed 16 knots, we are working hard but everything is going well, here let me say a word in praise of our Mr. O., whatever he was in the past, he has made up for now, he has worked untiringly, his organization is splendid, he runs the whole boat by a splendid system which can only be carried out by us working correspondingly and we are doing it, I was put down in the officers ward to day, with 56 of them and I did not reign long only the day, I would rather nurse savages than be dictated to by those conceited English aristocrats they treat an orderly like a valet, it was too XXXX for me and I could not stand it, and I told one what I thought of him and was reported then I threw the job in, one got a good dressing down from an Aust, and he wont forget it.\n","177":"\n\nAt it all day I was on night duty last night, last relief, 2.30 to 5.30 Reveille, makes it a long day we arrived at Alex- about six and went alongside, thereby making a record trip, fast time and through our good work managed to reach our destination with 900 wounded & sick, not a death & no complaints, to-morrow they will go off. Every man is proud of his mates and the Austs on board are proud of us whilst the Tommies congrat us, of all the lot would rather nurse British than Aust as the latter is a born growler.\n","178":"\n\nThe R.A.M.C came aboard at nine a.m. and commenced unloading patients, I was clerking & checking as they went off. The Aust & N.Z. went to Cairo, the others, British etc to a hospital. Here the officers are going into private hotels, the last patient went off at one oclock and we all heaved a sigh of relief we had finished a tremendous task and we felt we had done our duty, then a mail came on board from another boat on which H section are, they have been to Malta and back. We were paid and most of us went ashore to try and forget the past few days. I had a piece of singularly bad luck to day, I cabled home and put the receipt in my pocket later putting my hand in my pocket, pulled out a piece of paper thinking it the receipt and threw it away after to9 my chagrin I found that I had thrown away a bank note, then by a coincidence found a half piastre piece, to recompense me.\n","179":"\n\nThere was a big British & French advance yesterday.\n\nMost of the men went ashore after we had cleaned up in the morning and put 800 paliasses & blankets, quilts etc. since I can afford to throw money away I determined to stay home & have a sleep but about tea time I was hauled out to go ashore by my two mates from Ramleh. I was pleased to see them, they are getting very tired of the camp out there especially under Capt. Nicholas whom they all bitterly dislike, I gave them nearly all my Aust shirts, socks, helmet etc as they have had nothing , whilst I have done well. The Third Contingent arrived here a few weeks ago & went to Cairo, another is expected shortly I hope with my brothers in. things are just the same at Anzac & Sidil Bahr .\n","180":"\n\nThe American Cruiser “Tenessee\" is in again, & some of her crew got themselves into another row by public drinking the Kaiser’s health & showing the Union Jack in the presence of some Austs with the result that one of the neutrals was killed and seven injured. I went out to Ramleh to the transport to-day and spent an enjoyable time surfing in the breakers. The camp has improved and they are having a good time but a bit monotonous. As all my mates are there and I am sick of messing about on hospital ships, I am trying to get a transfer to there unless we do something definite.\n","181":"\n\nI was refused my transfer by the Col, that is another I have against him when the XXXX comes. The Saldanha, Galinha & Dunbar Castle have all been converted into hospital ships and painted, we are anxiously awaiting our next move, we just missed a trip to England this boat eventually is going to be converted to, we will be sorry to leave her as the crew are fine fellows and we are living second class saloon, the food & comfort of the cabins is a contrast to the Galenha.\n","182":"\n\nBeing pay day for the drivers they all visited us for the day, but unfortunately just came to say good bye, as we received orders to be on another boat the Clan Macgillivray before seven with all our equipment so we had to pack our kits again & imshi as we left the Scotian (the best boat we were ever on) we gave tree cheers for the crew they were fine fellows and tried to do everything they could for us, then we went over in a tug to the Clan, a dirty old tub, and worked hard loading her with equipment up till midnight, we even had to carry carcases of meat to the refrigerators as there was an Indian Crew on & it is against their religion to carry it.\n","183":"\n\nWe sailed at 5 a.m. at half speed, there are six nurses on board and a matron and it is funny as a circus, a man cant swear or curse as is a soldiers custom without one of the nurses hearing, we have to walk to the bathroom fully dressed instead of being naked like former boats, some of the scenes that occurred to-daywere good enough for a book, it has been a day of embarrassment for both the nurses & us. We were on fatigues all day cleaning up the ship God knows what we will be doing next. \n\nThere are a lot of Red Cross stores on board, & needless to say we are all now well equipped.\n","184":"\n\nOn fatigues all day preparing troop decks for wounded, although this is an old tub she is remarkably well equipped with stores & hospital necessaries. All day we just crawled along until nightfall when we steamed to 14 knots, with every light extinguished every precaution was taken, as submarines are about this region, a transport that left Mudros before us has not reported yet it is believed that she was sunk, her name is the Ionian.\n","185":"\n\nAll day long we took a zig zag route and at night time we made great speed, I never thought that men could be so frightened of submarines as the crew are on this old tub, every one from the skipper down to the black crew. Each man sleeps with a lifebelt under his head, our chaps are very nonchalant about it and are joking the crew. On fatigue all day preparing decks for wounded, the nurses are always getting them selves & us embarrassed by appearing at the wrong moment and mostly when Australian language is flying about.\n","186":"\n\nArrived at Lemnos before daybreak went right in Mudros just the same. We were lined up and told that we were to take the boat back with wounded and as soon as the big move was made to Kilid Bahr & Achi Baba from Anzac we would rejoin our Brigade, may the advance come soon is our earnest prayer. We were allotted to wards & in each there will be a sister in charge, I was paid a compliment by being placed in the operating theatre, two of us to assist the surgeons this is usually only a medical students position.\n","187":"\n\nLast night after I wrote my diary up we received our first load of wounded & sick off a mine sweeper just before we picked them up they were chased by a submarine but eluded her. All day batches of wounded & sick arrived until we were nearly full up, we are all disgusted with the sisters they are more nuisance than enough they lose their heads and are rushing round giving orders like old chooks, women are all right but they must have a man to do the thinking for them, they cannot understand us, they thought we were raw an inexperienced and now that they have found out we are not mugs at hospital work they are foolishly jealous of it. We had a few minor operations in the theatre to-day, bullet extracs etc. all the other L.H.F.As have been sent back to Mudros as they are only fooling about at Gaba Tepe.\n","188":"\n\nWe got through a remarkable number of dressings, & extractions in the theatre to-day, this is the work I love, Capt Fowler could not be nicer, it is a pleasure to work with him, he explains every wound & operation to us, and even lets us do extracting, I am quite an accomplished surgeons assistant now, I help with the dressings and am right handed on the operation table, the worse the case the more I like it. \n\nAll the bearers of H section rejoin us to-day and we are all going back to Alex to re-organise the corp, Capt. Fraschi and 10 men are on a mine sweeper operating in the Dardanelles. We have 400 men on board and as there are plenty of orderlies & six nurses it ought to be a good ship. We left Mudros at dusk and as we passed the line of battleships, the sailors on the Prince George played their band as a farewell to some of the brave lads, they all cheered, for Jack likes to cheer Tommy when he knows he deserves it. The French are the funniest of the lot they try to cheer like the British but in broken English.\n","189":"\n\nA big sea running all day and this old tub rolls in a calm, consequently there were a lot sea sick, the two doctors got sick in the theatre, it was great fun sterilizer instruments & all went over once , we had two interesting operations to-day, the taking out of a shattered eye with a shrapnel bullet, and a venereal operation. Most of our patients on this trip are Britishers, there are a few bad medical cases mostly enteric fever and dysentery, three of our own chaps are down with it.\n","190":"\t\n\nMade poor speed all day as the Capt wanted to arrive at Alex in the morning, I am very anxious to get back again as I expect my two brothers here any day, & moreover there is a big mail awaiting me otherwise I would never want to go near Egypt. Finished all our wound dressings by 2-30 to-day, we have got a quick system now, this has been an interesting trip for me & I have gained some good practical knowledge. Every day we hear rumours that Achi Baba has fallen & that the road to Kilid Bahr opened but they are only soldier’s dreams.\n\nArrived outside Alexandria late at night.\n","191":"\n\nWe did not go inside until after breakfast we had packed up most of the operating gear when the Col rushed down telling us not to pack as we had to go to Malta, only the typhoid & enteric fever patients and the officers went off here. The Lascar crew went on strike to be paid off as their time was up, after a long argument they finally got paid but agreed to come back & take us to Malta, by the time we sailed at six they were all on but 13 however we sailed without them. We received mail & pay to-day the mail is the latest from Aust, so there are two ahead of us missing. My brothers left Melb on the Ajana, so they ought to be here now.\n","192":"\n\nDressings as usual I am becoming an expert at it, every day the Capt allows me to to do a more difficult one, it is most interesting work and medical students must learn a lot by this experience I have learned things that otherwise I would have had to study for some time. We are making good speed for Malta, this is another new place we are seeing, the LHFA are tourists alright. I wrote another poem tonight as I had one of my rare moods on, this time it was to my mother on the losing of her three sons from home. The other day I picked up a piece of paper portion of the Rotheram Advertiser a Yorkshire paper & in it I was surprised to see my old Emden piece, that makes the fifth paper it was in.\n","193":"\n\nIn spite of a head wind we made good speed all day it was a trifle rough, dressing all day as usual. A lot of our chaps have gone under to illness, we have seven of B. sick down with fever now, who says the medical corps dont run danger, I am convinced now they work just as hard if not harder and run as much danger as those in the firing line one of our chaps named McLachlan died in Heliopolis about a month ago.\n","194":"\n\nArrived at Malta at 4 pm went right into quarantine harbour and tied up, none of the patients went off at night, doing so in the morning. It is a wonderful harbour and everybody seems to have only the one occupation that is swimming in the lovely waters, the town Valetta is built on solid rock, there is no earth at all and the whole island is one impregnable rock fortress on which some beautiful buildings have been erected every thing is quaint and our visit here will be ever memorable, the sisters & officers went ashore, but we amused ourselves by throwing coins in the water for the clever Maltese children to dive for.\n","195":"\n\nAll military patients went off at eight in the morning, and as they arrived at the Wharf were met by English & Maltese Ladies who distributed cakes, chocolates etc to them, the Naval patients we took around to the Naval Hospital in the Grand Harbour then we got leave and in partys explored the sights of Valetta, the first thing I did was to post my belt of badges home and some lace I bought for my sister then we saw the wonderful & beautiful ancient church of St John & the tombs of the knights, to describe it hear would be useless it is impressed on my mind for ever, we saw all the sights went through a couple of hospitals the wounded that can walk about are given blue & white uniforms & a red tie, they look very funny, there other clothes are taken from them, everywhere people show us kindness, the Austs are very popular here, all the Maltese girls glance their wonderfully beautiful eyes when we pass.\n","196":"\n\nAll day leave we rowed ashore and although the day was hot, we spent an enjoyable day, visited the Chapel of Bones, Armoury took two of our siters to the Military Hospital where we saw some of our late patients. Then we visited the Antonia Gardens at Birchercara, these are splendid all the earth has been carried there as Valetta is all solid rock, visited a fortress, saw a salute fired and spent an interesting day in the environs of Valetta. Every body shows us kindness but they cannot understand the free & easy Australians. Returned to the boat and we sailed at five o’clock leaving a Corporal & the Ships butcher on shore as they missed the boat.\n","197":"\n\nMade good speed all day we are en route to Alex, where the corp will be reorganized we lost three more men at malta making nine men down with sickness there are only five of us of the original B section bearers & tent division left, all the others are reinforcements. \n\nWrote a long letter home the first opportunity I have had to write a decent letter.\n","198":"\n\nUneventful day and weather is basically hot. At night I organized a concert and the sisters and Ships officers attended. Was a success but the crew were nervous before sisters and many did not appear when names were read out. The sergeants provided a burlesque programme in which everybody got a hit, mostly the sisters. Two of the latest Monitors en route to the Dardanelles before three weeks are up I expect to chronicle here the best news I have yet written in my diary.\n","199":"\n\nPassed a quiet day playing quoits with the sisters we had a sweepstake on the time the pilot came aboard at Alex he arrived at 5.22 it was a great race only half a minute separated two of the contestants. We anchored in the harbour and general leave was granted I was on guard on a prisoner so could not leave the boat, there was only the guard at home.\n\nThere has been a further advance by the British & French towards Achi Baba. Everything points to a big battle shortly and we will be in it.\n","200":"\n\nMy guard was for twenty four hours, so when the others got leave I had to remain until six oclock at night, all the sisters went off to the 21st General Hospital I was agreeably surprised when one called me up onto the boat deck to say good bye, somehow nurses seem to see my failing.\n\nWent for a feed and stroll when I was dismissed. We have definite orders to rejoin our brigade for the big advance, but before we do we will need a lot of work as we are all soft, I weighed myself last night & went 12 st. 3 lbs, a record weight.\n","201":"\n\nI got dental leave in the a m & went to the Deaconess Hosp, had one out and another temporary filling. Then went on to Ramleh to the drivers, they have had new kits uniforms issued, their horses are very poor and if they keep them there much longer there will not be many left, but they all expect a move shortly. Returned to town and had an enjoyable time, returned to boat found it had gone out in the stream so had to get rowed out to it.\n","202":"\n\nStill out in the stream all day long troopships arrived and at night seven went out loaded up with Kitchener’s Army we had an exciting experience to-day. As we were the participants of a collision, a Troopship the Ajax was going astern of us and in doing so grazed our port anchor ripping off a large plate of the Ajax stern, we escaped without a scratch. The Ajax is ill fated as she was direct hit at Gallipoli by shells.\n","203":"\n\nThis is like prison we have all spent our money & cannot get more and although there is leave, everyone of us have to prowl about the boat with nothing to do but growl at our delay as we have had official orders for Gallipoli. All mail from Aust during the day our most welcome diversion. Eight large transports left at night for the Dardanelles they were packed with troops. It seems old Achi will not be long now. Three boats came in from Aust to-day with reinforcements.\n","204":"\n\nHaving nothing to do we rowed over to the breakwater which is nice for swimming and were having a good time when two French girls turned up and with the usual French unconventional style undressed in the boat in front of us and came in I was the only one of our party that could speak a little French so needless to say had a good time with them. Boats keep coming in & going out all day but we are still awaiting further orders.\n","205":"\n\nWe hear a different rumour about our movements every 10 minutes. Staff officers & Naval officers inspect the ship & this causes another rumour. It appears that this ship is registered as a hospital ship & all the powers have been notified & yet we have made two trips with her without being painted accordingly. To the acts of The Hague Convention & there has been a big row about it as we were liable to be sunk & the enemy could not be blamed, we are full up of the messing about and want two things either Anzac or back to Australia.\n","206":"\n\nA big party of us went over to the break water for a swim found that it was a favourite mixed bathing resort on a Sunday morning so we had a good time. It is now settled that The Clan is to be a permanent Hospital boat and they commence painting her to-morrow. Two of our late sisters rowed over to see us they are at 21 General and are going on to the Dunluce Castle.\n\nThere was a smart bit of work by the Austs at Gaba Tepe a party of Turks attacked & were defeated in twenty minutes – 49 killed.\n","207":"\n\nWell it is settled at last and the boat is to be a permanent hospital ship for they commenced painting her white this morning. We rec. a small advance of money on our due and I went ashore & had the most enjoyable day I have yet had in Alex. I met my two swimming French friends and went to their beautiful home then I met an old Cairo Egyptian friend and he insisted on taking me to his harem. I finished up at the Casino where six bonny English girls were playing. Did not arrive home until small hrs of the morn.\n","208":"\n\nThe boat is becoming quite smart with her white hull & green stripe & red cross. On fatigue all morning on wharf getting Red Cross stuff for our next trip. Paid the balance of our money due to us, in a game of poker to-day I had remarkable luck as I was paid three royalties for four of a kind, headed by 4 aces. Went ashore and had a great time but I am becoming just a wee bit too popular, I have made a lot of friends her mostly of the fair sex and I cannot afford to live up to my invitations. Strange to say but nearly all my lady friends are French mostly married but with these I have become a bit of a social success.\n","209":"\n\nStill anchored in harbour whilst ship is being painted I lost all my money at poker to-day so had to remain on board, I have a heavy cold on me and it knocks me up.\n\nOne wants a lot of money to live up to Alexandria especially if he has lady friends and a soldier usually has two good days those succeeding pay day after that he has to growl & curse & wait for the next pay day.\n\nIt seems as if Rumania will soon be with us from what I hear from a friend who comes from there.\n\nAchi Baba still the same a few trenches have been taken by us.\n","210":"\n\nMy cold troublesome swallowed some medicine which relieved it fatigues during day. Drivers came on board and I went ashore with my mates at night had a good time. Alex is full of wounded soldiers, & Cairo has more than ever, with Kitcheners Army & 4 Brigades & a Division of Aust as well as the sick & wounded.\n\nIt seems as if Warsaw is on its last legs, their has been a bit of a skirmish at Aden with the Turks and some Aust transports stopped there but were not wanted.\n","211":"\n\nThere are seven Hospital ships in the harbour and they are all going out to-morrow, the painters are working night & day to get this boat finished white paint is over everything & one of our chaps who was sick has returned and a couple of the drivers are coming for a trip.\n\nHot day, swimming & writing our only recreation.\n","212":"\n\nReceived bad news that two more of our chaps are dead Tommy Price & Rosey, two of the strongest men in the corp, fever & pneumonia being the cause I wrote home but was annoyed as only the Sydney Mail arrived for us and I had no letters to reply to as they were not sorted by the time we sailed at six o’clock closely followed by the other newly painted hospital ship Seang Choon.\n","213":"\n\nOn fatigues all morning scrubbing floors and cleaning up & other house maid duties of the 1. L.H.F.A. The Seang Choon has been following us closely all day, one of our chaps has made a book on the result of who will reach first at night the former passed us and I have backed the Clan.\n\nThere was an angry scrap at Achi Baba a few days ago and the Turks lost heavily.\n","214":"\n\nThe Seang Choon seems an easy victor now and my money also. Nothing to do all day but play cards poker being the game, I played solidly all day until one the next morning with damnable luck to one man who had the beating of me every time I ran him up I was beaten on flushes & full hands & fours as soon as he finished I recouped my losses to a small extent.\n","215":"\n\nAt last we have received the orders we all wanted so badly – we are ordered to Gaba Tepe at 4 p.m to-morrow to take part in the biggest advance ever in history. Only the bearers will go the tent division remaining expecting to follow on in a few days. We pulled up all our stores with alacrity we will have to carry everything up to our dugouts. They are bombarding the positions every day and we hear the Turks are heavily reinforced so there will be something doing.\n","216":"\n\nElfie’s birthday & the anniversary of the proclamation of war by Britain. We left the Clan at 5.30 loaded all our stores & equipment on to a trawler thence on to the Navy patrol boat the Heroic this was crowded with men of the Cheshire Regiment we arrived at Gallipoli at 10-30 and were back again to the sound of the guns & flashes of fire, we snatched a little sleep then the Cheshire’s started to disembark into lighters, they continued until 3.30 when a tug came for us, & all was bustle we could not get all our stores off in time as daybreak was approaching & the Turks could see us & started shelling the beach we then loaded our stores on to stretchers and had to carry them up the hill that our lads had to fight so hardly for, all the way up we were under heavy shrapnel fire, it bursting all over us but with no effect eventually we arrived at the top N.Z Gully and put our stretchers down where the N.Z F & Mounted Ambulances are after a hunt for wood we had a splendid breakfast of bully beef & biscuits.\n","217":"\n\nAfter breakfast shells started to burst all around us so we had to dig ourselves in, some of the men have dug outs like furnished rooms, a mate & I built a beauty with some stretchers we had stolen but were discovered & as soon as we moved them they fell in so now we are just living in a hole in the ground like rabbits each man does his own cooking it is very amusing, we are only allowed a gallon of water a day & this is issued very carefully, our portion is most peculiar for an ambulance as we are next to the ammunition supply & A.S.C and there are two big howitzer gun placed near us whenever these fire a German aeroplane flies overhead looking for her, and as soon as it does shrapnel is fired on it by us. There are only a few casualties a day two chaps were wounded through exposing themselves to snipers one chap was swimming. After dusk I went for a walk through those marvellous saps to a well that is on the extreme left the water here is splendid. I missed the snipers & walked home at a brisk pace then received my issue of rum & lay down to sleep in my little dug out in the .\n","218":"\n\nFrom daybreak the enemy started to shell our gully, evidently the guns are located, everything is bustle for the attack on Hill 971 commences to-night, we are all wearing large calico patches on our back, so that the artillery will be able to distinguish their own men. I walked over to the rest gully where the 4th Bde are and met C.B. on returning a shell burst only five yds from me, bits flying in all directions, how I escaped I know not. About 4 p.m. the bombardment started all our beach battery guns were firing they were howitzers, the enemy had our range beautifully, their enfiladed fire was splendid only being a few yds from the batteries and about 50 yds from us, we all had to take cover, when I read this in later years it may seem like exaggeration but over a 1000 shells passed over our heads inside two hrs. one shell lit some gorse near a battery and three men were nearly roasted their clothes, hair & skin being entirely burnt off. They were brought to the N.Z. hospital & Picric Acid soon soothed their agony. To-day was our baptism of Hell, let loose. To-morrow we will see the greatest in history.\n","219":"\n\nYesterday the L.H. & others captured at 1000 yds of trenches on the right flank. Soon after tea last night we were told to prepare for action and we followed the Gurkhas & 4th Brigade & N.Z. up we all carried stretchers and very little equipment we journeyed through the main sap until we came to the first sights of the battle, the N.Z. dressing station hundreds of wounded were here but the lads had a runaway victory after daybreak we started to work our duty was to evacuate the Gully of Chailak Dere, we scattered and brought in a lot of wounded, mostly Turks bayonetted then we formed three stations the collecting from the aid post near the firing line then the evacuating to the beach our first mishap was when one of our barges loaded with stretchers was sunk by the Turks, then they started to shell the beach and they could not evacuate them on to the ships owing to the heavy fire, and the poor devils were lying about in agony watching the shells bursting amongst them, three wounded were killed, and one of our men was wounded, our aid post was just the same, we were under heavy fire all day & night & had to dress wounds with bullets whistling about our ears it was only a bit of a dugout.\n","220":"\n\nIt is a hard thing to write these lines as I would like to blur from my memory the thoughts of this awful day. Our brave lads achieved their effort & captured Hill 971 but lost it again, the casualties on both sides were enormous. We were evacuating the sap and along this all the mules, ammunition & reinforcements had to come up and the Turks knew this and poured shrapnel into it all day, it was Hell, they shelled the beach with the wounded lying helpless on they could not be taken to the ships we had to go backwards & forwards all day & night with our stretchers, stepping over dead, & being bumped by the mules, how we escaped was miraculous bullets went through our clothing but it got four of our best men two killed and two wounded, our patients in some cases were killed on the stretchers, dead were falling all around us but we continued.\n","221":"\n\nOwing to the congestion in the sap we were enabled to get of hours sleep last night, but at the patients cost, we could not get them away, and it was awful to see them suffering, they were lying out in the sap with the sun beating pitilessly down on them we did everything we could for them, made tea & bovril etc but the suffering cannot be described here in words. On the beach it was worse, the hospital ships are full & they cannot get them away and their they lie, many are killed on their stretchers the smell from the dead reeks the beach is frightful, they are burying as fast as they can, the N.Z. was killed by a stray bullet. When we did get a move on the R.A.M.C. could not get them away, some of these corps are badly managed. Our lads are just holding the hill but against enormous odds the N.Z.F.A. guns have been brought up along with us.\n","222":"\n\nStill in charge of the collecting zone. Our casualties are very heavy the wounded are lying in all directions, our ambulance was doing hospital duty as well as by feeding our patients & thus allaying the suffering. The hill was taken & lost twice during the day, the Maoris & Gurkhas doing wonderful work, but some of Kitcheners army are very poor they lost the firing trenches that the N.Z. won & retreated ½ a mile. The enemy brought up heavy reinforcements in masses German style but were moved down the shelf, one wounded officer said he got 2000 Turks with his Machine gun. Our Warships bombarded the ridges all day & the enemy slaughter was terrific but it also killed many of our men. I had the narrowest escape to-day taking a patient down on a stretcher two shells of shrapnel burst over our heads knocking my mate over but missing the patient & I by hairs breadth, the case landed at my feet & their was a great aeroplane duel between one of our men & a German Taube but the latter went for his life. The Austs have won immortal fame and a man is proud to belong to them.\n","223":"\n\nWe had a rather quiet day there seems an ominous lull in the fighting. The English Reinforcements did not prove too good, the Turks are making a great stand on the ridge, but our guns both naval & here are cutting them to pieces. We had a gruesome task to-day, we had to bury a dozen dead men, this was done for health sake as the stench was unbearable, we put rough crosses over them at their last resting place. Another of our men was knocked out, shot through the stomach, our . The Col & tent division arrived to-day when the heaviest danger was over, but we were glad of the reinforcements. Achi has reported to be fallen, the Turks. The hills around us are just alive with snipers & spies dressed in our clothing, our men arrested them, instead of shooting.\n\nOur Light Horse Brigades have had fearful losses at Popes Hill.\n","224":"\n\nA quiet day, we only took down about 50 patients all day, the enemy were very quiet, and our men are resting a bit on the hill, water is the main trouble, we have had our supply curtailed to a pint a day but they are making tea for us, each man does his own cooking, & some good feeds result, we all have our little dug outs, & they are well furnished with things the Turks left when they retreated. Our war boats & artillery must be cutting the enemy up, it is rumoured that Bosnia’s army has arrived. Another rumour is that all the Aust troops are going off for a spell God knows they want it they are only shadows of themselves, how they stick it causes admiration from everybody they will not retreat.\n\nFriday, 13 August, 1915\n\nThere were very few casualties brought down to-day and consequently we all thought we were going to get a spell, but we had a days digging & filling sand bags to make a shelter for our wounded just about sunset we were surprised by three bursts of shrapnel over us then followed a terrific air pressure and an awful report and earth blown up twenty feet into the air only a few yards from us, this was a Jack Johnson fired by a new gun the Turks have brought up three more were fired in the same place none did any damage as they missed the battery they tried to find but they gave us a nasty shock. The moral effect of our guns must be awful amongst the Turks, if you climb the next hill & risk snipers one can see piles of Turkish dead lying in a gully, it is an awful sight although the weather is hot it is better than otherwise but flies are our chief trouble.\n\nSaturday, 14 August, 1915\n\nAn exceptionally quiet day we just lay in our dug outs and cursed the flies, our food is splendid considering the difficulties, we are getting figs, stews, rice, rum lime juice, tobacco & Cigs now quiet presentable, when the Turks retreated they left all their belongings and they have come in very useful since. About 4 pm the enemy put about a dozen Jack Johnsons over our heads but none did any harm, the concussion is awful, every time these guns fire our aeroplanes go up and the enemy just pour shrapnel into them, but our plucky aviators seem to take no notice of them. We have returned over a dozen men with dysentery etc & what with our casualties our strength has been reduced, to-day Capt Francki took 20 men over to Monash’s gully where the 1st L.H. Bde are they are relieving the 4th F.A, it has considerably weakened our strength. There was a big fight on the extreme left during the night.\n","225":"\n\nWe are hearing all sorts of rumours Achi falls every day, but we have good reason to believe that there has been an important victory on our extreme left where the 4th Bde of Austs are. Everybody is looking forward to the next division of Austs landing English officers admit that in this country they are superb the poor Tommy is a sticker but he lacks that cut & come again style of the Colonial. There are some big guns on the beach now and some beauties coming, & I think Johnny Turk will soon be back in his harem. Another rumour is to the effect that Rumania & Bulgaria have joined the allies it seems too good to be true. Our reinforcements arrived today","226":" &","227":" only four and we are sending men back sick every day God help us if it rains heavily & we are here, cholera will rage, about dusk some Turkish shrapnel located the N.Z. Machine guns & killed a few, three bearers of another ambulance were killed going up to them.\n","228":"\n\nA quiet day but terribly hot, most of our patients were Englishmen suffering from sunstroke – There is a sniper that cannot be located not far from us and he gets a lot of men coming down the sap, these snipers are plucky they have bushes on their backs and their rifles & faces are covered with leaves. There is a well in the enemy lines and the road by is just one mass of Turkish dead piled on each other, one of our machine guns has the range & gets them when they come to fill their water bottles. Our guns did a lot of damage today & the enemy sent up two Taubes but they only come out when ours are not about. Fleas are causing us a lot of trouble sleep is a hard task Chailak Dere is flies by day & fleas by night.\n","229":"\n\nI went up into the trenches to-day & on to the highest peak the view was wonderful but as an order has come from hdqtrs that diaries must not contain any thing that would be of information to the Turks, I will not write anything about our position. The Turks have published an Aust diary, translated and distributed it right throughout the Turkish army. I had to go to Anzac at night to bring up all kits stores etc it took a convoy of 15 mules and we had to run the gauntlet along the beach where a Turkish machine gun plays. What we are going to do with our stores is a mystery but we were all glad of our kits & blankets , as we were sure of at least one warm sleep free from lice & fleas till they find them out. \n","230":"\n\nA terrificly hot day flies were unbeatable there were very few patients brought down during the day the sap is well organized now three ambulances are in it so that when we have our next rush we will be able to cope with it. We hear unofficially that a large transport the Royal Edward was sunk outside Lemnos, but the accounts are contradictory. During the day we had visits from General Godley & Ashmead Bartlett the celebrated correspondent. We are longing for our mail to arrive, their are three due now, one was supposed to have been sunk, snipers are still playing on the gully but are gradually being accounted for. Our beach guns did great havoc during the night & the Welsh Fusiliers in our gully charged & captured a trench & two saps. The Turkish dead is appalling.\n","231":"\n\nI had to go write back to Anzac & Walker’s ridge for Stores & had to lump them the four miles on a stretcher in awful rain, however we brought back an old mail with us so our hearts were lighter though the load heavy I rec nine letters. Two Taubes came over us to-day & saw our positions so we may expect shelling to-morrow. During the night the N. Zealanders took a Turkish trench just above us but later on the enemy counter attacked with bombs & drove our men back to their original trench. Our artillery blew up a whole Turkish trench including a few machine guns it was marvellous shooting. Patients coming down the sap are well treated now they get two cups of cocoa between the firing line. A few N. Zealanders were knocked out by shrapnel not far from us. My Brothers are in Egypt the younger is in hospital with slight typhoid.\n","232":"\n\nIn the morning early the enemy put a few Jack Johnsons to the beach but did not do any material damage , they got a few N.Z. with shrapnel, it was a light day for us. The N.Z. were relieved in the trenches by the Tommies. Three more of our men were sent away with dysentery etc to-day, a staff sergeant from our other party in Monash’s gully with the L.H.Brigade. when I first came here I found a Turkish Medical Officers Diary and to-day the Col insisted I should hand it in to headqtrs to be translated, I trust I get it back for it is an interesting souvenir, I have obtained a lot of things once the property of Abdul Turk.\n","233":"\n\nOur gully has been converted into a rest hospital for the men with slight dysentery. Our tent division are attending them. The big attack on our left flank commenced to-day & we saw it all from a point of advantage but one of our men was hit in the leg by a sniper, it was his first day up here. The navy started the ball rolling about 2 p.m with a terrific bombardment on the Turkish ridges on W hill, the din was awful but it was like sweet music to our ears, every shot was a delight, this was followed by a strong infantry bayonet attack but we could not recognize the troops, the Gurkhas & Maoris were there & judging by their smart brand new appearance I think there must have been some of the newly landed 5th Bde. We also thought we saw cavalry galloping, we know not the official news yet but we hear that they swung around a mile & a half capturing four trenches a few prisoners were brought down after the attack and a lot of our chaps wounded by shrapnel as they advanced\n","234":"\n\nWe heard the Turks counter attack on our left flank in the early hrs of the morn, and I believe they regained a trench but it was soon recaptured. The navy bombarded incessantly and their tremendous shells must have had an effect in our zone things are very quite neither side doing much a big ravine separates both so neither will try to advance as machine guns can mow them down. We erected some bell tents to-day and they are full already with patients, it is a shame that they should form a rest hospital so near the firing line. Amongst the Turkish prisoners on the beach is a woman, it is a usual thing for the Turks to take women into the camp with them. We are now getting bread issued to us. The cooks are giving us three hot meals a day.\n","235":"\n\nA brutal day the wind howled & the dust was in clouds, the beach was worse than our gully, it gave every indication of heavy rain, so we made our dug outs as secure as possible when it does rain it will be . When the advance was made on the left the other day, part of the 5th Bde got cut off and it seemed certain that they would be mowed down or taken prisoners, but they broke through the Turkish lines & regained their anxious mates. Our men just missed capturing the Turks 75 gun they heard it retreating but they got all the ammunition & some 60,000 rounds of rifle & machine gun ammunition as well as some machine guns & it is all piled on the beach, the transport now is wonderful thanks to the gallant little Indian mules they go night & day where it is even hard to walk.\n","236":"\n\nAll day our Navy bombarded what we think to be the Narrows, we only hear the echo here & it is like the rumbling of a thunder storm. We hear news of a great victory in the North Sea in which the Germans lost heavily including a super dreadnought the wireless to-day was very pleasing, the first news was that Italy has declared against Turkey so she will soon be here. Venezelos has been sent for by the King so it seems imminent that Greece will chip in. three hundred Turks were captured last night they surrendered easily.\n","237":"\n\nI went into the trenches to-day, up to the Cheshires and whilst a machine gun officer was showing me a look out a bullet grazed his scalp, a deliberate snipe. To-day I heard the saddest, pluckiest thing of the war yet heard of a man of the Wilts Regt. was brought in on a donkey being too weak to walk, this is his story, when the & retreated & lost the trench he was asleep and awoke to find he was cut off from his regt. & surrounded by Turks, & another of the party were the only ones not wounded & his lieutenant forbade him to leave him they had no water or food and after attending to the wounds of his mates he was surprised to find five Turks standing alongside him with all his arms & ammunition, seeing there was no hope he asked to be taken prisoner but they gave him a drink of water & shook hands & left them, the next night they came down again & robbed the dead & wounded & away again but would not take prisoners then three of them tried to escape one man being wounded but the Turks promptly fired on them & they had to go back they found a dead Gurkha & he had some biscuits there they shared with their wounded mates, the wounded were dying every day through starvation & their wounds were eaten by maggots & blow flies but they held on & on the ninth day without food, this man managed to escape & crawled to the N.Z. hospital where he ate like a savage a search party have now gone out with this man to relieve the others.\n","238":"\n\nThe search party that went out brought five of the men that were cut off, they were the only survivors, their condition was pitiful to all and their story worse to hear, they were brought into our hospital and given cocoa & food, some were even past the hungry stage & only eat rationally, the state of their wounds were awful fly blown & stinking.\n\nThree more reinforcements arrived to-day and best of all two big bags of mail from Aust, this is more acceptable than our night issue of Rum. According to the Melb. papers there has been a Parliamentary Recruiting campaign & it was a great success Victoria enlisted 11,000 in a month, the sooner they are here the better & give some of the poor Austs a well earned spell.\n","239":"\n\nI went over to Monash Gully & Quinn’s Post where the L.H. Bde are. I was unduly surprised to hear full extent of 1st L.H. casualties. About 4 p.m. a violent bombardment started by our navy & artillery when this surged our left flank attacked and the fight continued all night we are waiting for news to come to hand a German Taube flew over us & dropped bombs with little effect not far from us in the N.Z. Aust gully. There is a paper published here called the Peninsular Press and it gives all the cable & wireless news Germans are still pursuing the Russians, it is rumoured that they are trying to get troops through Bulgaria.\n","240":"\n\nRather busy day for us a lot of patients came down there are some machine guns & a battery of Indian mountain guns near us and they have been playing havoc on the Turkish ridges so consequently the Turks tried to locate them with shrapnel and we got the lot all round us, but no one was hit. We now learn that in the advance on Chocolate Hill two days ago we drove the enemy back & captured three trenches but our casualties though not heavy were enough. The L.H. are now out on the left flank having left Quinn’s Post.\n","241":"\n\nThe German Taube flew over us again this morning & dropped bombs three fell near headquarters but did non harm, this was followed by a lot of shrapnel all over the gully they are trying to locate the guns, the amount of shells fired by the Turks without doing any harm is enormous. Our canteen stores arrived to-day & were distributed each man receives so much & it is put down in value in his pay book it consists mostly of luxuries such as tinned sausages, fresh fruit, chocolate, cigs & tobac etc such things as are luxuries on the field needless to say at teatime we lived like lords but we paid dearly as four of us got Ptomaine poisoning I suffered during the night but felt better in the morning.\n","242":"\n\nSuffering a good deal through the poisoning, every morn one stretcher squad has to go to the beach to bring up rations & water by means of Indian mule convoys. \n\nThe Turks must have a new gun for they simply poured shrapnel on to the beach and into the sap all day with the result that in our convoy five mules were killed & a lot wounded as well as two of the Indians our men escaped it is remarkable the intelligence these mules show, the remainder of the convoy immediately took cover under the bank of the sap but we lost our stores till evening & about dusk eleven more mules were killed as they were tethered on the lines.\n","243":"\n\nWell, I have joined the long list of dysentery patients, it has a fair grip on me now I felt very weak all day but managed to get through the days work.\n\nWe rec another bag of mail part of our last mail & I got three letters.\n\nThere was another attack during the night on the left flank – the gun that is putting the shrapnel over us cannot be located yet it is surmised that it is a disappearing one run on wheels. An order has come that we have to evacuate our position here & take up another somewhere else, this is what we might have expected as soon as we were comfortable.\n","244":"\n\nStill bad relieved off duty placed on soft diet slops & milk etc. inoculated with Ethromycin the new invention doubt its value, I feel horribly weak.\n\nGreat news comes from the Sea of Marmora where our submarines are doing real blockade work they have sunk several vessels and have bombarded Railways & blown up bridges the news is very satisfactory to us. There is a general lull on our front except for the artillery of both forces. The enemy are continually shelling our sap hoping to get more mules & thereby stop our transport. We are off to-morrow to Maori Gully.\n","245":"\n\nEverything was packed up in the morning & the N.Z M.C. relieved us and then the mules came to carry stores etc down to our new position, I managed to get down but was done up when I reached the site, all the chaps were digging in and as I & another were so weak they erected a bell tent for us for the night. This place has many conveniences for a stationary hospital being close to the beach & main sap but the worst feature is that we have very poor shelter from shrapnel if the enemy send any shells over us. The gully is unoccupied & on one part of it the Turks have a machine gun played & snipe all day, we have no trenches up the ravine & the nearest to us are the Turks but our chaps are both sides of them. The warships\n\nbombard every night and the echoes are remarkable the din is awful, we have a wonderful view of the sea and as the sun sets below Imbros the scene is beautiful we believe our brigade is coming round here for a rest and we are going to look after the sick. Since the N.Z. took over old hospital two of the patients have been hit by stray bullets.\n","246":"\n\nMistake beginning of yesterday \n\nStill off duty feeling rather weak most of our stores went around to the new site to-day the remainder will follow to-morrow. We hear it is a rotten sight for a hospital camp providing very little shelter from shrapnel but we will see what it is like before condemning.\n","247":"\n\nStill sick living on this soft diet makes one horribly weak, all men were on fatigues. The camp is looking quite smart now. The Beach road runs along the bottom and the only man that uses it is a L.H. Dispatch rider and he has to run the gauntlet of bullets every time he passes the sap, a Turkish machine gun waits for him and fires all round him but just crouches low & rides at a gallop. A warship comes right alongside & bombards the Turkish trenches at Walker’s ridge her fire is marvellous, her shells landing right in the trenches. There is a report that a transport with part of the 6th Bde was torpedoed south of Lemnos but came in on her own steam, there were a few casualties, we are waiting anxiously for further news.\n","248":"\n\nFeeling better still weak. Part of the 6th Bde landed to-day, it was true about the Southlands being torpedoed & the Brigadier was killed. I soon got plenty of tent mates chaps from the 1st L.H. & the 11th – the 11th & 12th L.H. have been split up and are acting as reinforcements for the 1st Bde. We had some casualties to-day that were typical of newly landed Austs. A party of the 20th Batt went out to look for the machine gun sniper a sergeant in charge but so zealous were they that they exposed themselves and the result was six of them got badly wounded and we had to go out at night to bring them into our hospital.\n","249":"\n\nDischarged from hospital to-day and as the th Bde landed last night I asked permission to go around to them in Monash Gully expecting to see my brothers who are in the 6th Field Amb, I found the amb. alright but got a shock – when I heard my brothers were not there, one man told me that one of them was on the boat that was torpedoed, after a lot of enquiries I found a friend there and he informed me that they were both in C. Sect, and they were due to arrive at night. I was surprised at the number of men I knew in the 6th Bde, one thing we all notice about these new Bdes, that is their confidence to hear them speak out most think Gallipoli will be taken by them - Returned home made a dug out then at night went down for a swim.\n\nTuesday, 7 September, 1915\n\nOn fatigue all day digging saps, the Austs wont forget Gallipoli for digging many a back has ached through a pick & shovel. Finished a good dug out to-day. The new Brigades are nearly all in the trenches in now and our chaps are relieving elsewhere, our hospital is daily growing bigger, more of the poor old 1st L.H. Bde come in every day, half the poor devils are not sick but absolutely broken down. The 8th Batt are going for a spell to Lemnos and we hear the 1st Bde has gone to Alex, poor devils they want three months at home before ever going themselves again, broken in heart with work but you can never break the spirit of that glorious 1st Division. Went over again to the 6th F Amb but my brothers have not yet turned up.\n","250":"\n\nDate of transfer 1st L.H.R.\n\nI was surprised on waking this morning by several non-coms congratulating me on my promotion, I did not understand them until the Sergeant Major informed me that I was selected by the Col to go round to the 1st L.H. Reg. as medical detail to Capt. Wells, the Regimental Doctor, his Corporal has gone away sick and I am doing his work the first thing I did on reporting was to be taken on the regiment’s strength by the adjutant, then Capt. Wells gave me a dug out and put me up to the tips about rations etc. The Capt has a horrible reputation for his laziness amongst the men and is very unpopular but I will learn more as time goes on. However the job is a very easy one and is the envy of all my mates. There are only two sick parades a day 8.30 a.m & 5 p.m, and there are about 30 at each, mostly just cases Diarrhoea etc and then I do the Dressings about 15 last night, I got through my first parade splendidly.\n","251":"\n\nI got through my morning sick parade alright, this is practically a farce, they are mostly Diarrhoea patients & the Doctor sits down with his pill box in front of him & gives out pills, the main thing I do is the dressings usually about 15, scratches & cuts & minor wounds but they all get septic, apparently the old corporal was very lazy for I got a lot of extra chaps down just to see what I was like, by obliging one does not do any harm. I have the whole day off bar the parades so went round to the","252":" Amb again to see if my brothers had landed they had but the two boys were sent back with the transport the youngest is not very strong & the captain did not like separating them.\n","253":"\n\nTwo fairly big sick parades the Dr is as I heard frightfully lazy turns up late and has a nasty way of speaking although he does not interfere with me, I do my work and allow him to do his. I wrote home to-day but we have not rec any recent mail. Every day they are taking men off for a spell but very slowly, there was heavy artillery fire all day, the Turks put some big shells over but did very little harm, the navy bombarded all day. Our trenches here are 800 yds from the Turks and one squadron mans them one night & another the next every night one squadron go out sapping until two a.m then return home & get two hrs sleep but have to stand to arms from 4 am to daybreak in case the Turks attack altogether the men dont get half enough sleep.\n\nSaturday, 11 September, 1915\n\nThe 7th Bde of Inf landed to-day and the 2nd have gone off when the","254":" go we hear we are the next. To-day was a real red letter day as I received no less than 13 letters and papers in the big mail that came in. when mail arrives there is one huge smile of satisfaction over everyones face. We hear that this regiment is to be in another attack to-morrow night at a place called Snipers nest. There is great recruiting going on by Aust and it is badly wanted before Achi Baba & 971 & Popes Hill will fall. The Turks shelled nearly all day but have a poor idea of range.\n","255":"\n\nI have got into the full swing of my work now and find I have a splendid job, the kind that I always wanted, my own boss and no S.M’s to harrass you. Church service by Col. Merrington the Bde Chaplain in the p m the first service I have seen for four months, Sunday has been no different from any other day on active service in fact my diary is the only thing that makes me remember dates. The General & Staff, Birdwood & Chauvel were up to-day and looked at Sniper’s Rest and condemned the attack, the position is on top of a precipice and a Brigade scaling it would lose heavily for no gains. Rained a little during the night one man brought in slightly wounded.\n","256":"\n\nSpent the morning after sick parade in the trenches sniping at Turks for amusement. The range is 600 and a difficult shot, our machine guns are in a splendid position but never a Turk will dare to come this way. The Turks put two or three big shells over the beach at Anzac one on the hill being a high exploding we hear it killed 11 of the 13 L.H. and wounded several they had only just landed, the Turks have a 75 gun that they captured at Helles off the French and this is the only gun that ever troubles us Beachy Bill seems silenced. Canteen stores issued to-day the men did not do so well as the L.H. as for goods.\n","257":"\n\nAlf’s birthday.\n\nMy birthday, my second on active service, I trust I never have another. It is now officially reported that the Russians have gained a wonderful strategical victory over the Germans outside Warsaw, 900 German officers being killed it seems too great to be true. It is now stated that the big shell that came over yesterday killed only 1 but wounded five and got three N.Z. horses. The N.Z. went to day for their spell. I wrote home again, now I have plenty of time on my hands. The nights are getting very chilly now.\n\nTurn over for Wednesday\n","258":"\n\nFew showers during the day but not heavy, went up into the new trench to-day and had a few shots. Things are very quiet on our front now, there is only an odd demonstration now. The Turks can still snipe one part of the beach and yesterday they got the dispatch rider’s horse. There is a fine tramway down at Anzac now, and what with the motor lorry service it saves a remarkable amount of work. Anzac has improved wonderfully it is like a small city now only a few months ago it was an impregnable hill till our lads took it with the bayonet.\n","259":"\n\nWent round to L.H.F. for mail & drugs & found that two more of the old corp were dead Annand & Thomas, the former was the first man we had shot he died at sea next day, Thomas died of Enteric fever contracted on the hospital boats. Late in the afternoon there was a sharp attack somewhere either the Turks or us. Rifle & machine gun fire was heavy for about an hour we have not heard particulars yet. Our Reg got the order to stand to arms in readiness but it quietened down a lot then. No mail from Vic only N.S.W received at the corp.\n\nWednesday\n\nTwo big parades the general health of the regiment is very low as can be expected after five months here on the same food. Twenty five men of the old Regiment went away to-day to act as a bodyguard to Sir Ian Hamilton for a fortnight, they picked them out of men that had never been off the Peninsular sick or wounded, 25 of the 2nd Regt came around to take their place. The Turks put some more big shells over Anzac and at No 2 Outpost but did very little damage. The Bde received mail to-day but the L.H.Fs have not so far.\n","260":"\n\nRained during the day but as I live in the dressing station I have no fear of getting wet although those in the dug outs suffered. There is good news from the Sea of Marmora this week, I think that the subs there are weakening Turkey more there than all the land forces. Our Aust. Reg. Siege Gun Battery are here now with their monster guns, we expect them to do some serious damage. There are two big motor lorries running up & down the beach road now this saves a lot of mule transport. During the night the Turks went mad & commenced firing for about an hour they must have had an imaginary scare.\n","261":"\n\nChurch Service in p.m. by Col. Merrington, I attended I like his addresses. \n\nThe Dr asked me to-day to have my meals with him and as he has a primus stove and all sorts of delicacies and medical comforts I readily agreed, so now I have porridge for breakfast, we see very little of all the good things supposed to be sent to the troops, but we get more cigarettes and tobacco than we can possibly smoke.\n\nReceived a pair of socks from my sister as a birthday present.\n","262":"\n\nSome of the sailing vessells & tugs etc are getting very cheeky and defy the Turks guns but this morning one came right under their fire got hit badly, they rapidly unloaded her cargo and crew and dragged her onto the beach but she was beyond repair, our monitors and destroyers bombarded the Turk’s trenches at Walkers Ridge it was a lovely bit of shooting the shells dropping right into the Turks trenches. This is considered our only weak spot but all the same we wish they would attack it.\n","263":"\n\nBig sick parades I did more dressings than the Dr did cases.\n\nA mail in. I went around to the Amb. for my letters and on receiving them got the cruellest shock I have yet had for I rec bad news that dumbfounded me, I was like a man in a dream all day but plucked up towards evening making a firm resolution to carry my burden light heartedly, when a man gets bad news from Aust in this place it knocks the stuffing out of him, he has enough & sees enough here and wants only good news from Aust to keep him cheerful. \n","264":"\n\nA German taube flew over Anzac in the morning and dropped three bombs with the intention of wrecking the new pier that has been built, they all dropped harmlessly in the water, I went around to the to-day to Lonesome Pine trenches where the 1st Bde charged so splendidly during the big advance, the trenches here are always being shelled by the enemy, if a sandbag is put up it is immediately knocked down again. The nights now are getting bitterly cold this is the first touch of winter. We hear there has been a big movement on the extreme left but news is very scanty. One of our men got shot through the heart by a sniper whilst digging to-day.\n","265":"\n\nEvery night each squadron is out either patrol, outpost, in the trenches or digging & making saps. It is all night work & the day off, last night & to-day have been bitterly cold. The joking rumour now is that they are going to land as it will be too cold for us. Typhoid is breaking out now it is rather bad at Lemnos, in the next few days we will be busy inoculating against it. From our trenches they killed two big fat Turks that exposed themselves, they were snipers, they got one with the machine gun, the other with the rifle so they avenged the chap they got yesterday.\n","266":"\n\nSick parades becoming much smaller, mostly dressings. The Dr is very unpopular it is very hard to get on with him, in private life he is a man that one would feel like mocking; he has a horrible sneaking way and only a crawler would get on with him.\n\nAbout nine at night we were surprised by a terrific artillery bombardment on the right followed by heavy rifle and machine gun fire, we dont know what the attack was. We did not have to stand to arms. Some of the 25 of the bodyguard came over with stores to-day they say that every day the German taube drops bombs on G.H.2\n","267":"\n\nIt was only a demonstration by our chaps last night & the Turks did the rest, they generally fire for about two hrs after about 10 min, demonstration. Everything points to a big attack being carried off to-night on one day this week it will be a big one as great arrangements are being made.\n\nI made a new bivy to-day and I can crawl into this and have a quiet read, but if I sit in the dressing stn for a few minutes every passer by will suddenly discover that he has a scratch that wants bandaging or some trivial complaint.\n","268":"\n\nThe big attack did not come off after all and we were not called during the night. Bulgaria has mobilized as an armed neutrality and their have been all kinds of wild rumours that she has joined with Germany against the allies, I think this improbable although who ever does get her will have a powerful ally. Issued with new clothing to-day socks, shirts, tunics, hats etc all of a warm kind they a very acceptable as were rather cold in knickers. I rec a big stray mail today 9 letters in which was better news than the last. Church Parade in the pm.\n","269":"\n\nA lot of shelling going on all day.\n\nContracted a nasty sore throat gives me trouble, we are now issuing out soft food to the men arrowroot cocoa etc to those that are really sick. We received great news to-day that the British have made a general advance in Champagne district driving the Germans write back along a front of 20 miles. We rec the news with cheers. Wrote home during the p.m., my throat caused a lot of trouble last night. There was a small advance on the left during the night.\n","270":"\n\nMy throat was much worse and I had a slight touch of the flue, I never felt like doing morning sick parade but was relieved of it by the old Corporal returned from his sickness of course it puts my nose out of joint for his job but we are going to work together and make a good job of it he is a very decent chap and we are sharing our dug out together. I lay in bed all day & the rest did me good, we started cholera injections again to-day & will continue until the Regt is finished. Great news from France the general advance is doing splendidly, capturing 23000 prisoners & eighty guns.\n","271":"\n\nI spent the day fighting influenza I got really bad during the day, the Corp & I made a fine dug out and finished an elaborate larder having received three big parcels of good things. We work together and will get on splendidly I think.\n\nDuring the afternoon we inoculated another 100 men for cholera, I got another dose myself.\n\n90 Reinforcements came for the regt. to-day so they will soon be getting back their strength.\n","272":"\n\nHad a bad night in consequence I stayed in bed most of the day the corporal doing the sick parades. My temp was very high at night and the Dr wanted to send me away but I refused as I knew I could get myself well so I made a mixture of & washed it down with a heavy dose of rum in the morning another all the fever gone.\n\nGood news still comes from France and they are bombarding the narrow forts night & day.\n","273":"\n\nMuch better to-day went back on duty. The 25 menreturned from Imbros to-day. There has been a great rumour the past few days amongst the L.H.Bdes concerning a rising in the Sudan and that a Bde of Light Horse is going from Egypt to quell it and that they are taking the pick of our horses. It is not confirmed yet and our chaps are very incensed at the thought of being deprived the trip as they have proved themselves so efficient not only as L.H. but as Inf. The bombardment of the Narrows still continues day & night. Rec three stray letters one dated 5th May.\n","274":"\n\nReceived three Reinforcement Officers during the night.\n\nAlong side my dug out is a big reserve water tank, and it is part of the A.M.C. mens duties to keep the water supply pure, and be in charge of it. Consequently they are going to fill the tank daily by means of mule transport from the well, and the men will draw their water supply from it under my supervision so I will not be working in the dressing station so much it is an easy job but as lazy one the water allowance is one gallon per man per day. \n\nFrom what I hear there has been a big Naval Movement in the Narrows. Wrote to my father to-day from whom I rec a letter yesterday.\n","275":"\n\nA big mail in but none for the amb, in the past few weeks 6 men of the amb have been sent away with typhoid. We heard to-day that Chanak had fallen but it was not confirmed we are convinced though that there has been a big Naval success somewhere. Church parade in p.m. by Anglican Chaplain Capt Green I attended with my new mate the corporal he and I are of a very similar temperament and have much in common.\n","276":"\n\nAbout 10 a.m there was a tremendous amount of shelling on the part of the Turks both on the left & near us above Walker’s somewhere in the vicinity of Courtney. The Turks then jumped on their parapets preparatory to charging but must have got a scare as they got back again and it is rumoured that our lads counter attacked & took two trenches.\n\nWe had to stand to arms & those in the trenches had some shooting I was talking to two S.B.s we were in a group when the nearest to me fell shot through the back by a stray Bullet.\n","277":"\n\nWe hear that Germany broken the neutrality of Holland if so she must be sorely pressed. Great news continues to come from France and our general position is most favourable of an early success. The Heads seem to have something up their sleeves and wear a very confident look & we surmise there is something of importance happening hereabouts. I am back again on the water tank supervising the issuing & purification. Diarrhoea patients now get arrowroot etc cooked for them by a cook, this saves the poor devils a lot of trouble.\n","278":"\n\nStill supervising & caring for the sanitation of the water supply. Had a tooth filled around at the amb, Capt McK. The dentist is back there. Great news from France Sir John French very confident of early victory, on both sides Germany is getting a hiding.\n\nLately my mate the corp & I have been living extremely well, far better than in peace camp, we have scraped a fine larder together and live well, he cooks porridge and I dinner & tea which consists of anything from custards to Rissoles. Gallipoli has been the mother of invention for Austs.\n","279":"\n\nFurther good news from France & the Russian front but all kinds of fearful rumours concerning Bulgaria & Greece but nothing official. No doubt the end of this month will see the big change in the world’s destiny. The L.H.F.A. have 3 new officers as reinforcements straight from Australia. No mail yet. It seems to have gone astray. About nine at night there was a bit of a demonstration at Walker’s. My mate & I are very comfortable now we live well and have plenty of magazines a slush lamp & a pack of cards so are thoroughly contented.\n","280":"\n\nThe one topic now is Bulgaria, a man could write a book on the various opinions expressed, the only official news we have heard is that Diplomatic relations are severed between Russia & Bulgaria, Greece is another query.\n\nAbout nine at night just as we had got into bed and were having a read it commenced to rain then poured I was over against the wall and the water ran down and just poured into one spot and my mate was under it he got flooded out and had to sleep the remainder of the night in the dressing stn. During the rain there was a bit of an angry scrap about Courtneys at the Sphinx.\n","281":"\n\nIn the rear of our dressing stn is a shallow trench that leads right out to Walkers Ridge. As men used to go in this trench the Turks used to snipe them, but desisted for some time and the men got careless but to-day a party were going in and a sniper saw them and shot two one right through the heart and the other through the leg, I dressed the leg wound immediately but by the time the other chap was brought in he was dead. He was buried at night. The Dr as usual was nowhere to be found all day. It is reported that the Turks have used gas on the Indians on the right, and the order has come for each man to have his respirator in readiness. If the Turks use gas it is their last resource.\n","282":"\n\nChurch service by Col. Merrington a big attendance and a fine sermon, Fight the good fight –\n\nRumour says that the Allies have landed two army corps in Salonika in Greece in anticipation of Bulgaria’s attitude. Nothing of importance happening in our area. Wrote home but have not rec mail for over three weeks.\n\nIt is reported that German troops have crossed the Save & Danube. Varna has been bombarded by the Russians & it is reported that Greece is in a wobbly state.\n","283":"\n\nIt rained heavily about lunch time for about an hour our dug out did not prove a great success. Telegrams have been posted that “Four thousand Bulgarians deserted, refusing to fight Russians. A German transport was sunk by a British submarine in the Baltic and the Allies have had further gains in the Champagne district. Durnsk is occupied by Hindenburg and there is heavy fighting on the Serbian frontier. Greece decides to-day her future attitude.\n","284":"\n\nWe hear that the Canadians that recently landed are doing good work on the extreme left , nothing of any importance happening here, some days there is never a shot fired. The Y.M.C.A. have opened a canteen in Rest Gully and as we had received some pay I went around to buy some goods but found that it was sold out and the next supply already ordered. Bitterly cold all day we found the water rather chilly when swimming.\n\nRec part of my mail to-day dated 24 Aug.\n","285":"\n\nRec more mail & papers but a lot still astray. \n\nDuring the afternoon an aeroplane a British one came down on the mud flat on the left near Suvla, it is surmised to drop a wounded passenger , and whilst on the ground the Turks put a lot of shrapnel into it they must have fired 100 shots before absolutely hitting it and putting it out of action, when their guns were firing they must have shown their position as our poured big shells into them. Wrote home to-day to Elfie my letters were dated 24 Aug.\n","286":"\n\nA bit of an attack on the left yesterday but we never know the result of these attacks. Further good news from the other fronts, Greece has declared an armed neutrality with benevolent feelings to the Allies.\n\nMy mate and I spent the day erecting a new bivy we obtained the timber and made the frame work over which we stretched waterproof sheets and it is now as a nice bivy as is in the peninsular. We have a lamp & plenty of books & magazines and two stretchers for beds and as the nights are so cold we are in between the blankets at 6-30 p.m. and a nip of rum & milk warms us for the night.\n\nFriday, 15 October, 1915\n\nIssued with canteen stores to-day, we order them and a representative goes to Imbros and buys them at the canteen and the amount is charged up in our pay books. We buy mostly tinned stuffs & preserves. There was a big demonstration last night on at 4 a.m. in the morning extending from the right to the left along the whole front. These demonstrations are done to attract the Turks attention when a few brigades of Austs start cooeeing & yelling like mad the Turks think we are charging & move their trenches this prevents them rushing reinforcements to the real attack. Every one had to stand to arms but I was back between the blankets as soon as it was over. The monitors bombarded furiously.\n\nSaturday, 16 October, 1915\n\nThe last page of my beloved little diary, you have been my constant companion & solace day by day for twelve long months and now you terminate, I rec a parcel to-day containing books etc but the expected diary for next year was not in it. How ever I am going right on with my diary as I realize what it will be in years to come.\n\nSick parade getting bigger 57 paraded to-day, but mostly dressings it was 11.30 before we finished. Further good news from France and as I now close my book for 1914-1915 my earnest wish is that the next date next year will not see me still writing, to-day I wrote a poem to my friends mother and a copy is in the back of this book.\n\nStart 18 October, 1914\n\nOur Reveille went at 4.30 am and we got up & started packing all our kits were already gone we only had to take our marching order uniform, we had to ride our own horse and lead two others. We left camp about 7.30 on route to Melb, we were cheered enthusiastically all along the route. My pony was a trifle sore mouthed & several times tried to buck me off. We arrived about ten and at once commenced shipping our horses. This was done without a hitch and at noon we were all ready to sail. We were towed out with only two hours warning amidst cheers from the large crowd on the wharf mostly idle sightseers they cheered enthusiastically & we responded with songs.\n\nMonday, 19 October, 1914\n\nThe previous night we slept in ships hammocks & they take a lot of getting used to, I slept like a top. Going through the Sth Channel of the Vic Heads the old tub rolled a bit and there were a lot sea sick. I was not sick but very squeamish before breakfast. We had to do stable duties, muck out & feed & water. It is a tedious process especially when you feel a bit queer. The weather all day was wonderfully calm but the boat rolled a good deal. The food was a surprise to us & much superior to camp the day passed without much excitement.\n\nTuesday, 20 October, 1914\n\nI awoke with a bad attack of neuralgia & it made me feel very miserable. The weather was beautiful & the sea as calm as a mill pond.\n\nWe saw a lot of whales & one spouted within a few yards of the ship.\n\nI had up till this been sleeping on deck & caught a nasty cold in consequence determined to go below.\n\nWednesday, 21 October, 1914\n\nMy cold got worse and stables in the morning was a dreary job to me.\n\nWe started to exercise horses, which has to be done in calm weather. It is an awkward job & a dangerous one.\n\nI got kicked in the front of the thigh and was knocked against one of the rails. The result was a bruised back. I played poker at night & lost but felt too bad to play on.\n\nWe were paid £1 ships pay to day.\n\nThursday, 22 October, 1914\n\nAfter stables I felt pretty badly so reported sick and was exempted from duty.\n\nI spent the day lying in the sun & late in the afternoon went below & fell asleep.\n\nThe doctor came down & on taking my temp, which was over 100, ordered me into the hospital.\n\nI was the first to go into the hos. so christened it. I received every attention there and the bunks were much appreciated after the hammocks.\n\nCommenced to rain.\n\nFriday, 23 October, 1914\n\nI awoke feeling better & spent the day writing to my mother & Edith.\n\nThe Col & Dr came down to see me, I think they dreaded I was a measel contact.\n\nI read a few magazines until I fell asleep & the Dr awoke me, and on enquiry as to health told me I could get up next day.\n\nRained all day & previous night.\n\nSaturday, 24 October, 1914\n\nI awoke at daybreak & on looking out of the porthole was surprised to see land. We were approaching King Georges Sound & the scenery of the harbour was very pretty. We were first into the harbour closely followed by the Omrah. We anchored just outside Albany & before 10 there were five other troopships anchored also. We were informed that we have to await the convoy here & may be here four days. I sent wires & mail home.\n\nInoculated against Typhoid.\n\nSunday, 25 October, 1914\n\nStill in K Georges Sound other troopships arrived during night.\n\nChurch Parade at 10 o’clock Col read Psalm sang from Y.M.C.A. book, service was simple but impressive.\n\nExercised horses during afternoon.\n\nImpressive view of anchored troopships.\n\nOutbreak of measels 1 man in hospital.\n\nMonday, 26 October, 1914\n\nMore ships in Sound, 22 in all Orvieto the flagship of the fleet anchored alongside us. Cruiser Melbourne also anchored first of our convoy.\n\nOn Pickett, 24 hrs duty, 9.30-11.30 am 3.30 5.30 pm – 9.30-11.30 – 3.30-5.30 pm. Rained all day & night, Horse on main deck bad with colic. Five injections of morphine to deaden pain. Wrote to Edie to-night chancing reply whilst on voyage. Had a good look at my own pony whilst on picket, happy & well.\n\nTuesday, 27 October, 1914\n\nStill in Albany more boats arrived from Sydney now awaiting N.Z. troopers & Convoy.\n\nWednesday, 28 October, 1914\n\nAbout nine am the N.Z. troops with their convoy were sighted coming into the sound they made an imposing spectacle they anchored in line with us and the cruisers were dodging all over harbour.\n\nAt tea time a party of the men came over to us in a boat and exchanged greetings they stated that they have been six weeks on the water and came straight from Hobart on the voyage they lost 3 horses & one man.\n\nConcert at night great success I recited Fuzzy Wuzzy & The Day & was recalled.\n\nThursday, 29 October, 1914\n\nStill in K Georges Sound, mail arrives for lucky ones nearly every day.\n\nAll the fleet here now ready to move off, I think reason of delay is to allow N.Z. troopers to take fresh water.\n\nHad fire & hose drill, I am detailed to No 5 squad amidships on the pump.\n\nWas inoculated for the second time.\n\nSpent a lot of time reading we have a library on board containing some good books.\n\nFriday, 30 October, 1914\n\nOn Picquet again, men strongly object to picquet every three days.\n\nStable party very small nearly all the men off duty as result of horse kicks & minor injuries.\n\nParty went ashore in boat reported Albany a pretty town. Gale sprung up and they had to be towed home by a launch.\n\nI was appointed on a committee of five to be called the amusement committee.\n\nThe lights of all the boats lit up at night, all berthed in line makes a sight never to be forgotten.\n\nSaturday, 31 October, 1914\n\nDerby Day & here am I over 1000 miles away & do not even know what won, perhaps just as well.\n\nClose muggy day had to exercise horses again, depressing job on a close day as we are below on the second deck.\n\nA man named Janman was discharged to-day through refusing inoculation – poor devil he wanted it badly, he was terribly home sick, he has a wife & six young kiddies at home in Melbourne, he seemed quite joyful at the prospect of rejoining them.\n\nMy pony has been ailing for a day or two, so far we are the only boat that has not lost a horse.\n\nWriting letters is now impossible as censorship is very strict, we are not even allowed to disclose where we are.\n\nTuesday, 1st November, 1914\n\nCup Day in Melb, terrific gale where we are, all boats faring badly. Majority of men are sea-sick. I went down below & worked mine off.\n\nOn Picquet again discovered horse with colic – became worse but improved with attention.\n\nWhilst asleep this afternoon our W.A. contingent joined us two troopers & an escort at present I do not know the names of the cruisers.\n\nP.T.O. for Sunday\n\nWednesday, November 1914\n\nIn the Indian Ocean at last, we have yet to pick up the W.A. contingent.\n\nSea became rough & in consequence we did not have to exercise horses first aid & physical culture was the order of the day.\n\nMany became sea-sick I was squeamish but not sick.\n\nOur boat does not seem to pitch & roll like the others especially the Pera & the Armadale but she is bad enough.\n\nSunday, November, 1914\n\nWell we’re off at last, we sailed about 6 am, the sight was one that I will never forget. In three long files extending for miles our 40 ships moved off our escort being in front both sides & behind. Unfortunately soon after the start the Pera had some trouble with her engines & steered a very erratic course. We lie second in the middle of three following the flagship Orvieto. Whilst at Albany it rained nearly every night, the weather was most peculiar, the sky would be cloudless & in a few minutes we would have heavy showers. For this we shall not forget Albany.\n\nMonday November, 1914\n\nSea much calmer in consequence our regular work was resumed.\n\nMy Pony has a lump as now, poor little devil he is always in trouble he cant eat now & is painfully poor.\n\nWhichever way we look there are boats & surrounded by warships. It would be a wonderful view from a warship.\n\nApproaching tropic of Capricorn heat becoming more intense we walk about half naked only our nether garments on.\n\nThursday, November, 1914\n\nVery hot day granted half holiday to do our washing, it was very funny to see the efforts of the men.\n\nIn the morning we sponged the horses over with disinfectant & rubbed all superfluous hair off.\n\nOne of our horses died to-day of inflammation he has been sick ever since he came on board, it is the first we have lost, whilst the mortality on the other boats is very heavy.\n\nConcert at night, successful turn out, I recited Taking his Chance, Gunga Din & The Day. A Mail boat the Osterly passed the fleet about 6 pm it must have been a great sight for the passengers.\n\nFriday, November, 1914\n\nTerrificly hot day like a furnace down below amongst horses. When I first commenced this diary I wrote that our duties were light. My Opinion is now greatly changed as we are always doing something with the horses. \n\nI have discovered the names of the escort as far as we know, of course we surmise there are others cruising further away, they are Cruisers, flagship Minator, Sydney, Melbourne, Pyramus & Japanese Ibuki.\n\nOrganising a sports meeting to be held on Sunday.\n\nWrote a poem to my mother whilst lying in bed.\n\nSaturday, November, 1915\n\nHeat terrific, firemen exhausted keeping up speed one man taken ill consequently lost speed & dropped behind for about a mile it gave us the opp to study the other boats, however we soon made up our ground when the new watch came on. Orders were issued from the flagship that between the hours of 8 to 8.30 all lights must be extinguished. It was just for emerging practice & the men fell in in their respective fire stations without a word. What is generally a myriad of lights was total darkness as all the fleet extinguished her lights. Danger is ahead somewhere as the officers are taking every precaution. Expect something important to write shortly.\n\nSunday, November, 1914\n\nRoasting day oppressive & sultry Picquet. In morning stables crushed my thumb badly whilst removing a horse. Pain was so much that I fainted whilst it was being dressed. The Euripides had a burial service of a young private who died. The service was in view of us it was impressive. In the afternoon a sports meeting was held on our boat & the men enjoyed themselves immensely. Although grave danger is lurking ahead it only makes the men more eager for fun.\n\nMy poem to my mother has been copied by over twenty on board to send home.\n\nMemorable\n\nMonday, 9th November, 1914\n\nAs I prophesied two days ago that there would be something doing in a day or two. About eight oclock in the morning one of the boats rec S.O.S. message & the four cruisers steamed away. The next we knew was that the Sydney had sunk the pirate Emden or rather beached her on Cocos Islands. \nShe was next heard of having the Cruisers and Konigsberg\n. My best description is in poetry I wrote. Had a patriotic concert in night in honour of it. Col shouted for every man.\n\nAnother man died & buried on the ill fated Euripodes , on this memorable day that made the Aust. Navy famous.\n\nTuesday, 10th November, 1914\n\nHeat terrific only a day off the equator, the men are doing their duties stark naked. We hosed horses to-day and the splashing & laughing was like a lot of schoolboys swimming. On an average I have about five showers a day.\n\nThere are four more deaths of men reported from neighbouring boats but we do not know anything about those in the rear.\n\nThe true facts concerning the sinking of the Emden are to hand and as space is not allowable here am writing this in my note book sufficient to say that the Sydney also captured German collier took the crew off her & sunk her then took the crew off the Emden & sailed direct for Colombo.\n\nWednesday, 11th November, 1914\n\nCool breeze I forgot to say that the Col had to call on volunteers to go down as as the firemen could not mop up steam. Only a few days off Colombo expect to cross the Equator to-day. No matter how hot the day it is a strange thing that there is always at least one shower during the night. There have been more buried today but considering that there are 36,000 troops the death rate is not large. We have not heardanything concerning the Minator who was chasing the German Cruiser Koningsberg .\n\nThursday, 12th November, 1914\n\nTropical showers prevail, without any warning they pour down but only for a few minutes.\n\nTo-day the Melbourne steamed away to Colombo with advance orders for the fleet. The Minator who is in pursuit of the kongsberg has not reported so far. An armed merchantman of the C.P. & R. line passed us to-day en route to the Cocos Islands to repair the wireless & cable stations destroyed by the Emden. She will also bring back the remaining prisoners as the Sydney could not hold all. This boat is of the latest armed liner type and I think her name is the Empress of Africa.\n\nFriday, 13th November, 1914\n\nNearing Colombo the N.Z. troops went ahead to coal & water. We will follow, but they will be finished before we are there. The Melbourne escorted them.\n\nThe report is now practically confirmed concerning the beaching of the Konigsberg but by a British cruiser the Chatham.\n\nI previously wrote that the Sydney had gone to Colombo now I learnt that she stopped with the Emden.\n\nSaturday, 13th November, 1914\n\nMail Day, owing to strict censorship we are not allowed to divulge any name, date or place in our letters. All this mail must be posted, unsealed, but we can write two letters and tell all the news in one this is held back at the authorities pleasure before forwarding. I wrote one long letter for publication to home & one other, also one to E.\n\n5 a.m. Sunday morn the Empress of Russia with the cruiser Sydney passed us returning to Colombo with their prisoners.\n\nSunday, 15th November, 1914\n\nSighted the pretty isle of Ceylon at daybreak, view magnificent. Palm trees & wonderful buildings. We left the fleet & went right into Colombo at noon, we anchored alongside Sydney who is a little knocked about. The N.Z. are here and all kinds of warships from friendly countries. We are not allowed ashore but the natives are alongside us all day long coaling and selling goods. The Devils ask absurd prices but can be beaten down 500% I bought a box of 100 cigars, good cheroots for 5\/- as well as innumerable presents to send home.\n\nMonday, 16th November, 1914\n\nCoaling in the busy & picturesque harbour of Colombo. The coaling being done by natives who talk more than work, they are a dirty lot, but keen for a bargain. I vowed to buy no more from them but the result is I am now nearly broke. We should leave to-day but judging by the way they are coaling it will be some time to-morrow. The Euripides & the Argyllshire came in for water. The men are very jealous of the N.Z. being allowed ashore, as we are not. Bought presents for E. & M.\n\nTuesday, 17th November, 1914\n\nLeft Colombo about 10.15 am & went straight ahead for Aden. The other boats will catch us up. Our escort now is at present the Hampshire. I have since learnt that 40 of the Emden crew escaped in a private yacht when the Emden was sunk. The people of Ceylon seemed delighted at the loss of the Emden, as all trade had ceased & the harbour was congested. Over 200 were killed & wounded on the Emden, three on the Sydney the latter is going on to Malta to effect repairs?\n\nWednesday, 18th November, 1914\n\nWashing day in morning stables. We lost our second horse to-day but the first of the L.H.F.A. to die, a fine horse I think he died of pneumonia. Our Colonel Tate Sutherland asked me to-day to help him write his article on the care & management of horses. He wrote it roughly & I sub-edited it. It was not bad but I had to improve it a good deal. He is going to re-write it. Our speed has been very poor and we have been keeping the other boats back but if it was not for us causing the slacking of speed we would have got the news.\n\nThursday, 19th November, 1914\n\nThe boats we left at Colombo have now caught us up, and are in line the Jap. Iboyki being their escort. Our course & movements are being kept strangely quiet, I have not heard anything from the signaller since we left Colombo. The heat is now very muggy & we are exercising & hosing all day long. The water is absolute red with rust, so we will have plenty of iron in our systems.\n\nFriday, 20th November, 1914\n\nThe water man is complaining that the consumption of water is too great, far above what our allowance is to date. He threatens us that the tanks will run dry before we reach Port Said. Unfortunately we have not a condenser of any size on board.\n\nMeasles have broken out rather badly over five men now being in hospital. Owing to the porridge for breakfast & lack of cooling medicine, nearly all of us are more or less covered in blood pimples.\n\nSaturday, 21st November, 1914\n\nAbout 3.30 a.m. shots were heard & those that were awake thought there was a big engagement on. When daybreak came we could plainly see the Jap cruiser Ibuki holding conversation with 3 of our transports & with her searchlights on. All sorts of fearful rumours were spread but this is the official news about 2.30 a.m. the blue funnel transport Arcanius rammed the leading boat the Shropshire. She had a hole in her starboard stern 12 ft. long but above sea level so she will be able to reach Aden providing we get good weather. Two men were reported overboard & that was the reason the cruiser was looking for them with her searchlights.\n\nSunday, 22nd November, 1914\n\nPrevious night had a concert most successful yet, had Violin & good artists. I recited my own compositions “The last of the Emden & Thoughts of Home as an encore. Nearly every man on the ship has a copy whilst the latter is the most popular. Church parade to-day was note worthy as it was the initial attempt of the ship’s choir. They sang splendidly gave the lead to all the others and the hymn Nearer My God to Thee was splendid. As every man joined in and the lead was given, it was impressive showing what a planted seed will do.\n\nLionel’s birthday\n\nMonday, 23rd November, 1914\n\nWish him many happy returns & hope his next will see him placed differently. We sighted the Island of Socotra about 8.30 a.m. so are now in the Arabian Sea. We surprised at the length of the island it being nearly 100 miles long. We were only five miles from it all day long.\n\nMeasles have broken out badly there being twelve patients in the hospital some outside as accommodation is poor. Malaria is suspected in one of the men.\n\nTuesday, 24th November, 1914\n\nDay wonderfully calm, sea like a vast sheet of water. Washing day for the men again. Expect to reach Aden to-morrow afternoon. We are going in for water & forage both are very low. Expect to send mail so am writing some to-night. Am on Piquet on Stores & Guard room, my duties are to guard the prisoner in an empty cell. But a guard must always be on. There is a table seat & light so one can read & right. Picquet comes every 2nd night now as so many men are in hospital.\n\nWednesday, 25th November, 1914\n\nArrived in Aden about 4 p.m. only to learn we would leave again next morning, without going right inside. All our other boats were there & the N.Z. also a lot of empty Indian transports returning home. The outside view of Aden is anything but picturesque just bare rugged islands of rock. We received a budget of war news to-day that was not very satisfactory.\n\nThursday, 26th November, 1914\n\nLeft Aden about 6 a.m. all complete with our full fleet but only the Hampshire as our escort. All day land was visible, we were in the Red Sea now & Arabia on one side Africa on the other. A lot more Indian Transports passed one numbered 125 showing what a lot of boats were in the fleet. Returning home men are being discharged from hospital daily. There is a strange sickness on board that no one knows the origin. It leaves the men with a head ache & loss of appetite.\n\nFriday, 27th November, 1914\n\nFearfully hot day, typical Red Sea, muggy & close. All engineers & firemen knocked up.\n\nPassed islands known as twelve apostles.\n\nMen complaining of headaches, it is just stifling working ‘tween decks. On guard again, worst yet experienced, owing to heat.\n\nEngineers absolutely beaten temperature below 135 in engine room.\n\nSaturday, 28th November, 1914\n\nLike a clap of thunder came the shock of the voyage to us. We heard the sudden news that we were to disembark on Tuesday next at Alexandria, Egypt & there complete our training at Cairo. The men were dumbfounded as every man expected to be going home for Xmas. Although it upsets all my plans I am rather glad we are going to Egypt it is a country I always wanted to see. The col. made a speech at concert at night.\n\nSunday, 29th November, 1914\n\nOur last church parade on the Southern. It is funny to listen to the various opinions of the men regarding the object in us of training in Egypt. My opinion is that we are practically relieving the British garrison for a while and that our numbers, 35 000 may intimidate the hostile Turks & fanatics.\n\nAll afternoon was spent getting our kit together and at 5.30 p.m. we paraded in full marching order. In the clouds at night I saw a strange phenomenon. A mass of cloud had formed the exact shape of the map of England & Wales. All the men saw it & thought the same.\n\nMonday, 30th November, 1914\n\nExercised horses I hope for the last time in the morning in the p.m. we cleaned our saddles up a bit, the iron going very rusty with the sea air.\n\nEverything is being hauled up for disembarkation. All the other boats but our line have gone ahead. This sounds as if we will go through the canal & disembark at Alexandria.\n\nThe sunset views are magnificent have to be seen to be believed.\n\nTuesday, 1st December, 1914\n\nArrived at Suez about 2 p.m. where all the other boats were waiting. An order was read out that every man with rifle & ammunition must get the same in readiness as an attack is expected in the canal from the banks. As far as we know we are going to Alexandria to disembark. We dropped anchor about a mile from the mouth of the canal in view of both towns of Suez official & Arab town.\n\nCigarettes most expensive in Melb. are ridiculously cheap here. Nights are rather cold now.\n\nWednesday, 2nd December, 1914\n\nStill anchored outside Suez at seven a.m. a large fleet of ships was seen on the horizon as they approached headed by the old Euryalus & a French cruiser we saw that they were the 2nd Indian contingent en route to the front. We greeted them with cheers & they us with frantic whoops & yells. They anchored alongside us fifteen in all. With our boats & the Indian transports all anchored at the mouth of the canal it made an imposing sight. The loyalty of Britains dominions. We received some very satisfactory war news that the Allies were gaining ground.\n\nThursday, 3rd December, 1914\n\nA German tramp named Triffles which was captured by the British passed us in the morning. She had ammunition on board. An aeroplane passed o’head about 9-30 am & another before lunch. We entered the canal about 2 pm in the wake of the Miltidaes. We were cheered all along the beautiful entrance by French, British & Egyptians all detail of the trip up the canal I have written in my note book. The canal was patrolled right along the banks with Indian troops, encamped & with batteries. Canal beautiful scenery expect to reach P Said in morning.\n\nFriday, 4th December, 1914\n\nArrived at Port Said at 5 am anchored alongside dock with 3 French Hydroplanes & Port Said crammed full of boats. Three firemen gave trouble & marines from the H.M.S. Swiftsure came aboard, they took the men off and charged them with insubord, refusing work & thieving from troops. They informed us that they were going down the canal to bombard the Turks, who are reported to be not 50 miles away. All the eastern district of Port Said is flooded by dykes thereby protecting the city. Took French leave over side of boat at night & went ashore with a party had royal time.\n\nSaturday, 5th December, 1914\n\nLeft Port Said about 9.45 am and anchored about 2 miles from the town.\n\nWe heard that where we are going to camp is 50 miles from Cairo & the train from Alexandria could not accommodate more than 3,000 a day so we are going in three ships at a time.\n\nReceived mail from mother dated 2nd Nov passed boat with E. Kints on board.\n\nSunday, 6th December, 1914\n\nMoved about a mile to get into position before leaving the men are very eager to get to Alexandria & are chafing at delay. Mails were sent from here to-day but we were informed that a boat would call in ten minutes, it did not call until next day so our letters were very brief Orvieto & Miltidaes gone on to England after unloading. The former has the prisoners of the Emden on board.\n\nMonday, 7th December, 1914\n\nArrived at Alexandria and anchored amongst 5 prize German ships that are being kept in the harbour. Everywhere is excitement since martial law has been proclaimed the harbour has become very congested. All sick men have been removed to quarantine camp and we \nbelieve the horses are going into a rest camp before proceeding to Maadi.\n\nTuesday, 8th December, 1914\n\nHeard we were to disembark and so eager were the men that they all got fully dressed and we even put our bridles on the horses in readiness, but it was a false alarm as we afterwards heard that we may be here for three days. It was too much for me so a lot of us took French leave over the stern down a rope into a waiting Arab boat. We went ashore & had a great time, coming back early in the morning some fellows on the Wiltshire were the limit as they climbed up the chain of the anchor thence through the hole a height of over 40 feet.\n\nWednesday, 9th December, 1914\n\nGranted leave for half day all the ship went, half in morning & half in afternoon had a great time, all the men enjoyed themselves it was very funny watching their antics, from haggling over change piastres etc to riding donkeys. They took possession of the town, driving about in gharries, in cafes and all ways that can be expected, they behaved themselves well & a few that came home late got 7 days C.B. posted more Xmas p.c & presents to M. & E.\n\nThursday, 10th December, 1914\n\nWhen we were ashore yesterday some of the sergeants for a joke got the second engineer tight then dressed him in uniform & took him ashore the joke however had a serious ending as he was arrested when he came back on serious charges wearing kings uniform without authority, ridiculing the rank & absence without leave. They were all punished accordingly one of the sergeants losing a stripe, whilst the engineer resigned. \n\nA man named Primmer of A. sect L.H.F.A whilst sparring fell & broke his knee cap he was removed to hospital and from there he will go back to Aust.\n\nmistake of date Friday 1st page of memorandum\n\nFriday, 11th December, 1914\n\nWent along sick at 7 a.m. with the Ketuna she had half her horses off but owing to scarcity of trucks could only take a few off, and those are encamped alongside station waiting for trucks. We commenced unloading about 2.30 and got up all our stores & waggons & motor car etc. We believe we will unload horses to-morrow. General leave granted for whole boat at night of which we took full advantage. Unfortunately owing to calling and going ashore at all the ports I am like the majority broke.\n\nSaturday, 12th December, 1914\n\nWhen we reached Cairo we took 2 horses each out of the trucks & led them into the station yard where we were served with a much needed cocoa & bread & cheese then we started on our nine mile walk to Maadi, through main streets & busy traffic, and the horses playing up and shying we were in full marching order. We journeyed through narrow lanes of the Arab quarter and the horses went mad at sight of camels. It was a wonderful trip the scenery was mag passed pyramids & alongside Nile most of way. Reached camp at 12 weary but happy & after a dinner of tinned beef & we had to erect tents & put horse lines.\n\nSunday, 13th December, 1914\n\nWe awoke much refreshed & had the same breakfast watered & fed our horses who had enjoyed rolling in the sand. The rest of the day we were on fatigue duty. All as stiff as door posts, trudging about in the sand. Maadi itself is a lovely place, an oasis in the desert and there are beautiful drives & gardens & villas the property of wealthy English & French & Americans who winter here, but we are on the desert with all the Australians but the Vic Infantry & L.H., they are at the Pyramids & the N.Z. at Heliopolis.\n\nWe are delighted with the news that five German cruisers have been sunk to date.\n\nHarold’s birthday\n\nMonday, 14th December, 1914\n\nWish him many happy returns of the day. The Reveille & calls of the Queenslanders are far superior to Vic trumpeters. \n\nAlthough days are warm nights are cold. In the morning we took the horses for a four mile trudge in the sand. The rest of the day was spent in lecturing & fatigue. We heard to-day that the 2nd Aust Contingent had disbanded & was not coming they being held by payment as reservists. It does not look as if we will see much. Some say we will be home in 3 mos.\n","287":"\n\nMorning exercised horses afternoon lectures on health day leave has been now instituted. Pay day what was owing to us at the rate of 1\/- a day was paid to us to-day. I drew nothing as I made a mistake in the amount I was being paid so only drew 6d a day against 1\/6. in the afternoon was the official opening of a reading & writing tent presented to the troops by the Sirdar of Egypt I wrote a long letter home in it at night to home.\n","288":"\n\nHad saddlery inspection on horses. I mounted Sammy he never even moved, the boat quietened him. Our camp is now in full swing. On picquet at night bad night dense fogs, horses getting loose all night owing to pulling their ropes out of sand. We have a splendid canteen run cheaply by Lipton. Yesterday was the opening of Turkish Parliament at which the Khedive was present. Something important may come out of it. Newspaper reports state that German Cruisers have bombarded English Coasts.\n\nThursday, 17th December, 1914\n\nIdeal weather is the rule of climate in Egypt. The winters are perfect. The view of the Pyramids & Nile at sunset is magnificent. I went on leave at night to Cairo and had an enjoyable time. It is a magnificent town and its buildings are most modern. You want to spend some months in it before you really appreciate it. Whilst there I called on the editor of Egyptian News & had a chat I may do some work for him.\n\nFriday, 18th December, 1914\n\nOn Day stable picquet all day from 6.30 to 6.30, horses breaking loose all day, the method of picketing horses is very unsatisfactory. Nearly all horses suffering from cracked heels.\n\nTo-day 101 guns were fired from the Citadel announcing that Egypt is now a British protectorate the taking over ceremony is to be held in Cairo on Sunday. It is not really an annexation but taking it over as a British protectorate, the Egyptians are allowed their own rulers under British. The newly appointed Sultan is H. J. Hussein 1st in place of the late Khedive who has gone over to the Turks.\n\nSaturday, 19th December, 1914\n\nMy turn for day leave could not take it owing to lack of funds gave it away. Had a splendid job all day, Military Police. We are getting splendid news from the front. Allies victories but cannot account for German bombardment of English coast. The men took it pretty seriously as Scarborough is the native place of one of the men. We are all itching to get to the front or see some fighting, this camp is deadly monotonous. We are now allowed 6d a day worth of extra provisions a man so we are living much better.\n\nSunday, 20th December, 1914\n\nChurch Parade in morning one for each denomination. Ours was a good one, a fine military sermon was preached. In the afternoon we were marched for a shower bath about 3 miles through Maadi along the banks of the picturesque Nile thence to the native prison, whose baths were placed at our disposal. They were lovely and badly needed in a large room to hold the lot of us, firstly hot showers then gradually cooler to cold. They refreshed us so much that we marched back whistling & singing the Marsellaise, to the delight of the French residents who cheered and applauded us.\n\nMonday, 21st December, 1914\n\nYesterday was the accession of the new Sultan, great ceremony, all Egypt decorated with flags & bunting, big procession of British & Aust Troops & Egyptian Cavalry. The class Egyptians rejoice at the new regime under British rule & there are only a few against it, these are mostly mercenary troops that may go over to the Turks.\n\nThis morning we rode our horses for the first time they all went well with the exception of a couple of harmless spills. Sammy went well but a little too eager.\n\nTuesday, 22nd December, 1914\n\nIn morning mounted troop drill ponies a bit rough mine especially. We heard that there was to be a big parade of the Maadi Camp of L.H. through Cairo to salute General Maxwell the “governor\" who is in command of all troops in Egypt. There were only eight allowed to go out of all our section of over 50, & I was one selected.. in order to make an impression we spent all the p.m. polishing our saddle bits & doing up our harness & it was late at night when we finished.\n\nWednesday, 23rd December, 1914\n\nReveille 5.15. we were up at once watered groomed & fed all ready, the whole corp turned out to see us off. Sammy played up all the way in & gave me a rough ride. We were the last in the process. We arrived in Cairo & started from the station thence on up the main street past cheering Egyptians till we reached the Continental Hotel which was packed in with 1000 of Europeans who cheered us to the . We saluted Sir John Maxwell & his body guard here. Then we returned homewards, it was a dusty ride but we reached the camp at 2.15 p.m.\n\nThursday, 24th December, 1914\n\nAfter long ride yesterday I began to feel my old complaint on me again reported at hospital & am being fixed up but am not allowed to do any riding for a while.\n\nI seem to be in trouble all day Capt Nichols roared at me for 3 times and for falling asleep whilst at lecture. \n\nSpending Xmas Eve on picquet, at time of writing this it is about 12 oclock in Melbourne. I wonder how they are spending it at home.\n\nFriday, 25th December, 1914\n\nYes, Xmas Day in Egypt far from dear old Australia, I wish all my dear friends & relations the happiest of Xmas in such awful circumstances. Xmas morning all the men went out for a ride around Maadi, I stopped home & with a few others went to morning service & heard a fine sermon the text of which was “Behold, I bring you good tidings\" & my earnest wish is that the long expected Xmas mail from Aust will do so. We sat down to Xmas dinner for the first time in our new mess room. Our dinner was composed of boiled meat & potatoes & some tinned fruit. In the p.m. I went for a long walk with some mates around an ancient village.\n\nSaturday, 26th December, 1914\n\nI went on all day leave to Cairo I visited the museum and its antiques & mummies of ancient Egyptian Kings, then went to Ghezira to the Territorial sports. I picked up with an English family and they entertained me for the day. It was an English officers wife & her two sons & daughter and they did every thing possible to make my Xmas happy. The mother was like my dear little mother in her actions treating her grown up sons as if they were babies it was a heart link to Aust for me. In night I went to Salle Kleber Anima and saw on the screen the records of the Aust Troops through lines I saw myself distinctly.\n\nSunday, 27th December, 1914\n\nBeing sick & having to see the doctor every morning I did not go to Church Parade in the afternoon. I wrote a long letter to E. and at night went for a stroll through Maadi. When we returned we had a great joke with our tent mates, we pretended we had met two English girls and gone for a walk, we got them really mad about it as English girls are as rare as diamonds here and now the whole camp is teasing us about them. So far we have not received any Aust mail from the time we left Albany. There are 3 mails now due.\n\nMonday, 28th December, 1914\n\nAll heard fearful rumour of the big engagement in the North Sea, but only a rumour. At night on picquet & got guard patrol, not going on my shift until 10.30 so I walked across to the recreation tent where a concert was being held after it was over I walked back to the lines and a corporal came up to me & told me I was under arrest & had to report to S. M. I did so & found that the guard had been turned out & four of us were missing including the Corp of the . We were all remanded to orderly room the following morning. During the night on picquet an A. section mare presented us with a foal but it was premature.\n\nTuesday, 29th December, 1914\n\nOrderly room call went at 8.45 a.m. & we were paraded before the colonels tent, the corp was charged first & after hearing his evidence he was remanded for courtmartial. We all got severely reprimanded by the C.O. and got seven days C.B. my first default since I enlisted.\n\nI let my pony be ridden by an N.C.O. to-day, who is a bit rough on horses but I wanted the freshness taken out of him & I am not allowed to do it. Every half hour after Retreat the trumpet sounds Default & we have to run like Hell on to the parade ground to be dismissed this continues until lights out.\n\nWednesday, 30th December, 1914\n\nCourt martial continued this morning we all gave evidence on oath finally he was severely reprimanded, we all thought that he would lose his stripes.\n\nPay day but still I draw nothing having not yet worked off my debt I had my pay book altered so will be all right next day. At night wrote to George. On day stables all day with the other 3 defaulters. \n\nLately the corp has not been working very smoothly, the officers of both sections have been quarreling & the men are very dissatisfied.\n\nThursday, 31st December, 1914\n\nOn Tuesday Sir G. Reid inspected the troops at Mena and is taking the salute from us here to-morrow. A couple of squadrons of N.Z. arrived to-day to take part as they are in our division. New Year’s Eve & I am on C.B. i have taken it to heart pretty badly as the C.O. could easily have let us off to start the New Year fresh & not with punishment. I will not be allowed to take part in Review to-morrow. Many of the men celebrate N. Year by the officers & S.M. with .\n\nNew Years Day\n\nHappy New Year to all in Aust. at 8.30 all 1st Bde of Aust Light Horse moved off with the D.S.C. They looked splendid as they marched past the saluting point at Ma’adi station where Sir George Reid took the salute looking fatter & happier than ever when they all returned & unharnessed they were marched to head quarters where Sir George addressed them in a short cheery speech congratulating the Australians on their fine appearance and telling them that Lord Kitchener had promised him that we would all go to the front as soon as we were ready. Three ringing cheers were then given by the troops for the King Sir John Maxwell & the High Commissioner.\n\n"}}
