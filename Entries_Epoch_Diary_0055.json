Our Hydroplane is doing his tour of inspection over the battle field. Letters from home again. Received a beautiful mouth organ from Clare.\n","138":"\n\nCloudy. Moved into the firing line again on the right of our position. Splendid sheltered trenches. The Turks gave us no trouble except to give us a shot at the trench occasionally. It was cold towards dusk. Our artillery had a turn at them about 7 P.M. and shook them up a bit. We watch the enemy through periscopes.\n","139":"\n\nFine\n\nWe snipe at the Turkish trenches when we see a target. Heaps of dead Turks can be seen round all their trenches which are about 400, 700 & 1100 yds to our front. Our trenches are fairly safe now & loopholed. Nothing exciting happened today We left the fire trench for a rest about 6 PM having done 24 hours on watch. Had to haul up an 8 Pounder gun. It was hard work\n","140":"\n\nFine\n. So far we have had plenty of hard work & little or no rest right from the word go. Australia’s boys have stuck to it so far & will stick to it to the last. Our platoon went down to the beach for a swim but the enemies shells stopped us after we had got down. Several more chaps wounded with shrapnel. Navy bombarding on extreme right all night. On guard all night.\n\n \n","141":"\n\nDull\n Few drops of rain. Came off duty this morning about 5 AM. Our artillery stirred up the Turk again & they replied wounding some more of our fellows. We are waiting for more guns to come up before towelling them up. Our platoon resting today. Fifteen of our plat. ordered to go out and make a road for guns. I missed that job. Had the best night’ rest since landing\n","142":"\n\nDull\n Enemy very quiet with his artillery but rouses up with rifle fire at night time. We scarcely fire a shot. I think they are nervous fearing an attack from us. Our \npatrol\n Bu. sends out patrols every night for reconnaissance. They returned one man short last night. Engineers also go out to throw grenades and guncotton into the Turkish Trenches\n","143":"\n\nDull\n showery\n\nWent into fire trench last night at 6 P.M. Navy bombarding a troublesome gun of enemies. Weather brightening up again. Practically no rifle fire from the trenches of a day time\nHauled out at 6 AM from the dug-out to do with two others. Went into the fire trench again at 6 P.M & watched all night\n\nwrong date here\n","144":"\n\nFine\n and hot\n\nHauled out of dugout to go sapping with three others for three hours from 6 AM to 9 AM. And went into fire trench at 6 P M. In our front the Turks are entrenched on a large ridge. beyond this is a beautiful stretch of country. Had a fair nights rest.\n","145":"\n\nFine with lovely cool mornings. Came out of trench this morning at 6 AM. The routine for our platoon is 36 hours in the fire trench & 12 hours out or vice versa. When out of the trench we are available for fatigue of which we get any amount. I with 5 others & an N.C.O. are for guard tonight at 7 P.M. Short artillery duel otherwise fairly quiet.\n","146":"\n\nFine\n Came off quarter guard this morning 7 AM. More shelling. Enemy has another on our right. More casualties.\n","147":"\n\nFine\n. Went into fire trench again last night & stayed there till 6 PM tonight when we were shifted up to a supporting trench for a night’s rest. We had to draw water for the cook’s before turning in. Enemy very active of a night time. They have more machine guns very close to us & a battery of big guns on our right.\n","148":"\n\nFine\n Came back to reserve trench this morning about 5 AM. Enemy busy with new battery on our right. More arguing the point with them.\n","149":"\n\nFine. Some light horse chaps said to be in the trenches on our left. Turks very quiet but busy. Carried mail up from beach. Busy at night time getting rations for quarter master of our Batt. Very little sleep. Enemy bombarded our trenches furiously. We were nearly driven crazy trying to dodge the terrific shell fire\n","150":"\n\nFine Ordered into the sap as extra lookout The Turks attacked strongly about 3 AM. Their yell was thrilling as they charged our trenches. Our rifle fire was terrific. The machine guns on each flank did good work also. The Turks charged right up to the parapets. They retired about daylight leaving hundreds of dead and wounded.\n","151":"\n\nFine. We expected a final attack last night but did not get it. Their rifle fire was continuous. We took over 100 prisoners yesterday. Came out of trench \nyesterday\n this morning, for a spell & went back again about 6 P.M. The Turks waved flags & parties got out of their trenches & stood up while another party came forward & held a parley with our General. Evidently in connexion with their wounded\n","152":"\n\nFine\n Turks fired continuously all night. A large body of men were waiting to fill the trenches in case we were attacked. Nothing of note happened. We have mainly machine guns in the trenches now. Our guns were firing nearly all night. Have had a good rest today.\n","153":"\n\nWet. Trenches very muddy\n\nEnemy throwing large bombs but did no damage. Fairly quiet otherwise. The explosion from this bomb is something like that from our \"Japanese Bomb\".\n","154":"\n\nFine Beautiful peaceful day. Just an occasional crack from a sniper to break the silence. Officers from the enemy parleying for a truce to bury dead. In the afternoon the enemies guns got busy & wounded three of our chaps. I went to hospital today feeling done up, been going for a month with nerves strung.\n","155":"\n\nRaining Slept well last night. Feel very weak. Had to leave hospital to make room for other patients \n HMS Triumph torpedoed by a hostile submarine\n. Very quiet day. Wrong date\n","156":"\n\nFine. Great relief to see the sun come up on a clear day. Left hospital today to make room for other patients. HMS Triumph torpedoed by a hostile submarine. She turned over and sank in about 10 min. I with others of the Batt. saw the whole catastrophe. It was an awful sight. The submarine as far as we know has not been captured or sunk.\n","157":"\n\nFine. Our company has been relieved out of the trenches for 24 hours. We have abundance of reading matter through so many of our chaps who have been wounded not turning up for their papers. A French aeroplane dropped bombs on Turkish trenches, I could see the bombs falling. The machine then circled round & flew away. It was a very pretty sight\n","158":"\n\nFine. Our artillery began the day with a tremendous outburst the enemy not replying. Our aeroplane again dropped bombs on the enemie’s trenches. Finished the day up on fatigue\n\n \n","159":"\n\nFine. Our fatigue carrying water for the company. The Turks shelled us with 9.2 in shells and did no harm as usual. Our guns doing a bit for their living again, the enemy replying. We pelt bombs & flares of all sorts at one another of a night time. More reinforcements have reached us\n","160":"\n\nFine Lively work near the 4th Batt. trenches. A few Turkish prisoners taken. Many men wounded. Lively sniping between our chaps and the Turks. Came out of fire trench at 6 PM. Our aeroplanes very busy doing reconaiscance work. On guard tonight\n","161":"\n\nFine Cooked some bacon & fried some biscuits and had a good breakfast which we finished up on marmalade, (Pte Jones & I.)\n\nBeautifully calm and peaceful. It seems a pity that war should ever reach these parts. An occasional shot from a sniper reminds us that we are at war. Today ended with our guns bombarding the Turks Trenches forcing them to shift out. The Turks lost heavily.\n","162":"\n\nFine hot day. Very quiet day. We kept enemy snipers quiet by continuously shooting at his loopholes. Many chaps returned who were wounded the first day (Sun 25th April.) Our platoon \nare\n is acting as supports to the firing line to-night.\n","163":"\n\nFine\n. Our artillery roaring again Indian Batt. doing good work again. I with three others went down to the D.A.D.O.S. had a swim in the sea and brought up some bombs for the trench mortar. Cpl. Lyons was in charge of us. Had three good meals today & went into fire trench at 6.45 PM.\n","164":"\n\nFine. Navy bombarding Kaba Tepe Hill very heartily. Nothing else to write about. Came out of trench about 6 PM. On quartermasters fatigue until 11 PM bringing stores for our Reg. up from the beach. Our chaps took a trench on the left under heavy fire. Many Turks were captured.\n","165":"\n\nFine. On water fatigue. We have scarcely have any rest now. We have to go over in \"Shrapnel Gully\" for the water so named because of the deadly effect of the Turk’s shrapnel shells there. Great artillery duel this morning. Water fatigue \nagain\n this afternoon. \"A tot of rum issued to every \nman\n\"\n","166":"\n\nFine\n. Our platoon in the firing line again. No news on account of our \"Peninsular Press\" not being published. quiet day\n","167":"\n\nFine Our platoon having a rest ahem!? We had to do all sorts of fatigues. I was mess orderly for the platoon & Orderly Room Orderly at the same time. Went back into fire trench in the evening. We always knock off work to carry bricks. I wrote one letter. \n","168":"\n\nFine. Our chaps attacked the Turks trenches on the left again and held them until 3 AM next day when they evacuated them. The attack was made to draw a large number of Turkish Rein. who were going to strengthen the right flank. Sergt Bramhall and two men went out on patrol and returned safely\n","169":"\n\nFine. Had a good night’s rest last night without being disturbed except having to stand to arms from 3 to 4 A.M. the usual thing. We are very inactive so far as fighting goes and I am wondering what it is to end up with. Back to fire trench again tonight.\n","170":"\n\nFine. We exchanged shots a treat with the Turks last night. They have a very formidable barb-wire fence in front of part of their trench.\n\nLeft fire trench again this evening. Our guns kicking up a row again. Brown’s Battery especially. This life is getting very monotonous.\n","171":"\n\nFine Same old routine. Feeling a bit off. Was allowed off duty today. Another artillery duel. Flies here are in millions and they are awfully familiar. They crawl over our food in hundreds. Much sickness is reported among the various Regiments probably owing to these pests.\n","172":"\n\nFine. Saw the doctor this morning & he sent me to the clearing station & from there I was placed aboard the Fleet Sweeper \"Newmarket\" to be sent to Lemnos Island with other sick & wounded to recover.\n\n \n","173":"\n\nFine We left Gallipoli Peninsular about 3 AM this morning and were well in Muedross Harbour by 9AM. Landed on the Island about 12 PM and were fixed up in our respective tents at 2 PM. I have been placed on milk died. Enjoyed a good undisturbed night’s rest.\n","174":"\n\nFine windy. A Turkish aeroplane dropped bombs or tried to on the camp here yesterday but they dropped in the water. Am feeling better today. Many French, Algerian, Singalese and British troops are here. It is a relief to get away from shot and shell and see a little civilization again\n","175":"\n\nFine. Very windy. A hostile aeroplane again dropped some bombs here doing no damage fortunately and made a good escape although he was fired on by our warships. Am well looked after here. There are many patients here. \nCholera\n has broken out\n","176":"\n\nVery windy. I have been placed with the medical patients in P Ward (a large roomy tent). The doctor examines us regularly at 9 AM each morning. The orderly is very attentive to his duties\n","177":"\n\nFine Beautiful day. Still on the mend. We have plenty to eat. Am on Milk Diet but am expected to be off it soon. Breakfast about 7.30 AM dinner at 12 PM. And tea at 5 PM. Lights out at 9.30 PM. Rise about 7.15 AM. All those who are able to do so\n","178":"\n\nFine\n On Light Duty. Nothing of interest to record\n","179":"\n\nFine\n Money scarce otherwise I would be enjoying myself entirely. The paymaster has not turned up so far though.\n","180":"\n\nFine. Church parade for the patients. My chum from the 3rd Batt went back to the Peninsular today with many more chaps who have recovered from their illness. Feeling a bit depressed. Expect to be back myself in a couple of days\n","181":"\n\nHot\n Gen Sir Ian Hamilton looked the hospital today. He seemed a very genial old chap sitting on the side of the beds inquiring as to the nature of each patients illness, myself being one of them. One point about him is that his teeth are \nhis own\n","182":"\n\nVery hot. I with many others came over here to the English Convalescent Hospital Tents. The red Cross staff here are slightly undermanned here at present but they do their work well. \n","183":"\n\nHot. The doctor here visits us about 10 AM each morning. am afraid the commissariat dept here will not come up to the Aust. Hospital but it may improve as it has only just started.\n","184":"\n\nHot. Sick and wounded men continue to arrive from the front. All who are fit are discharged to go back to the firing line from the hospitals.\n","185":"\n\nCool breeze. Many patients who are convalescent go in for a bathe as we are only a few yards from the water’s edge. The supply of food for patients has improved considerably during the last few days. I am on Milk Diet. Fancy that, after the life we have led at the trenches amongst flies \n& dust\n","186":"\n\nHot. We expect a little rain today, but it only ended up with wind thundering and lightning. It must be very monotonous for our lads in the trenches. The same process every day 24 hours in the fire trench & 24 out to do fatigues. But they are boys of the Bull-dog breed. We are looking forward to an issue of tobacco\n","187":"\n\nHot. A church service was held at the church tent this morning at 9 AM. Also a confirmation service at 6.30 AM. I attended neither I am ashamed to say.\n","188":"\n\nHot Many warships have moved out of the harbour here. Judging from the noise last night there is evidently a big bombardment going on at Cape Helles.\n","189":"\n\nHot. The heat is making itself felt here just now. It is extremely unpleasant in places where dead bodies of Turks lie within a few yards of our trenches, it being impossible to send burial parties to bury them as it would only mean more \ndeath\n.\n","190":"\n\nCool wind blowing Nothing eventful to record\n","191":"\n\nStrong cool wind blowing. The sun shines warmly and not a cloud is to be seen. It is one of those weary beautiful days where one seems lifted into another world. The waves gently lap, lap against the shore and I lie under a shady tree where the music of the sea gradually wafts one into a peaceful sleep.\n","192":"\n\nDull. Cool wind blowing \n\nFor the want of something to write -- \n\n\"To the Belgians\"\n\nO race that Caesar knew\n\nThat won stern Roman praise\n\nWhat land not envies you\n\nThe laurel of these days\n\nLawrence Binyon\n","193":"\n\nFine\n Heavy shower of rain last night. We often get a thunderstorm here. None of those light showers so common in Australia but big drops of rain that wet one through in quick time. Had a nice ramble with a fellow patient, of the Kings Own Scottish Borders & named Walker\n","194":"\n\nFine Another shower of rain this morning. I am some others are to go to the Provost Marshall tomorrow\n\n","195":"\n\nFine\n Got some fresh clothing today from the Hospital stores. I with about 20 others came over here to the Provost Marshall’s camp for \n\" light duty\"\n","196":"\n\nFine Placed on duty on the Aust. Pier No1 to help with the Lighters when they came in full of water. There are six of us altogether and we get on well. So far no lighters have turned up as there is one in the way which is aground and cannot be pulled off by hand.\n","197":"\n\nFine\n Went down to pier about 6 AM and left it about 6.30 PM. Nothing doing all day. We were hauled out suddenly by the Corporal to go and pump water for the carts from 7 PM until 9 PM as the tanks had got a bit low. Just now the hospital is short of water but it will be remedied in a few days.\n","198":"\n\nFine and cool. I go in for a bathe every day. The water is shallow for ever so far out. Even a learner would be safe on his own at 300 yds out. Our food supply is good in our new quarters. The evening and nights are beautifully cool\n\n \n","199":"\n\nFine Windy. Went aboard \nHMS. Bacchante\n with some companions and was shown round the Engine Room by one of the sailors. They gave us tea and made us feel at home. They invited us over on Sunday when I could look over the guns and torpedoe tubes.\n","200":"\n\nWindy. Horses, lorries and Ambulance wagons landed this morning.\n","201":"\n\nFine. Drew rations for the Camp. Attended a church service conducted by Rev. Mackenzie on the hill near the wind mills. Had to pull a barge inshore to be cleaned out ready for storing water.\n","202":"\n\nFine. Eight men of us went down and cleaned the barge out this morning. Drew rations again from the 29 Divisional Transport tent.\n","203":"\n\nDusty\n Hot wind\n\nNothing of notice to record\n","204":"\n\nStill very dusty. Went aboard H.M.S. Venerable with some friends after pinching a boat from the wharf. Had tea on board & was given a few articles by one of the sailors. They are all jolly good sports.\n","205":"\n\nFine Several piers nearly completed. They are built mainly by Egyptian engineers\n","206":"\n\nFine Very dusty. Clouds of dust fly over the camp. The flies and heat are very trying. Have been acting brakes-man on a water cart to No1 Aust. Stn. Hospital.\n","207":"\n\nHot and Dusty still. A shower of rain just now would be very acceptable. This continuous fine hot weather together with the fly pest is extremely un comfortable\n","208":"\n\nBlowy and hot. Got up a bit late this morning. Am usually up about 5.30 AM. Our bell tents are not very cool. So far we have been using mules in the carts brought either from England or India.\n","209":"\n\nDusty. Received a welcome letter from home. I have to feed the mules today as our driver has gone as brakesman.\n","210":"\n\nDusty. Fed the mules again today. They are stupid animals and require a good deal of patience while being handled. A number of fresh mules arrived tonight to allow the others to have a spell\n","211":"\n\nDusty. On the brakesmans job again today with a new driver. A little Lancashire lad too. He always believes in taking short cuts through his sentences. We started to cart water to No 1 Aust. Hospital about 6 AM & finished about 1.30 PM.\n","212":"\n\nMighty clouds of dust. Beautiful evenings\n","213":"\n\nDust Dust Dust\n\nNothing but dust\n\nGetting quite unbearable\n","214":"\n\nDust again\n\nWe draw rations in a motor lorry now. We don’t half \"swank\". I am off the water cart job now. Not sorry either\n","215":"\n\nDust \nDust\n Dust\n\nService in store tent.\n","216":"\n\nHot More dust. joined the Provost Marshall’s working party under Cpl Donovan (Lancashire). Making horse troughs\n","217":"\n\nSame old dust. Still building horse troughs. No hay issue. Pretty rotten\n","218":"\n\nSame\n\nA number of our camp paraded before the doctor to see who was to go back to the Peninsular. I am fit alright, he said.\n","219":"\n\nWe have shifted from the old camp site to a cooler and better one where the dust never troubles us. We are on an Is. about a mile and half in circumference. Everything ready to leave which we took.\n\n2.45 PM It’s crook leaving good tent mates \nagain\n See names \non back\n","220":"\n\nFine. Back at Anzac again. Embarked on sweeper about 3 PM. Left Lemnos Is. About 5 PM. & arrived here 2 AM this morning. Got back here in the trenches about 12 noon. Everyone given \nrespirators\n and \nhelmets\n. Major Scobie (now Lieut Col) is back and in charge of Batt.\n","221":" –","222":"\n\nWarm. Cool breeze blowing from the South. Water fatigues for Hd. Qrs. In fire trench tonight. Heavy bom. by our howitzer guns. Two Turkish trenches taken on our right by 11th Batt. with a number of prisoners. My best friend, Joe Winterbottom gone to hospital sick\n\nSunday August 1\n\nHot Quiet day, so far 9 A.M. Artillery duel raging 12 p.m. Turkish gun on our right flank bombarding the beach. Both sides aeroplanes busy. \n","223":"\n\nFine Turkish aeroplane flew over our lines dropped some bombs and darts and then scooted off. Turkish Jack Johnstons came over for about an hour but did no damage except make a few large holes in ground.\n","224":"\n\nFine. Both sides aeroplanes scouting up the clear sky. Expect to see an air fight any time. The Taube never waits for fight though. She is very fast. Had a narrow shave from Jack Johnson this morning they are very large shells. \n","225":"\n\nTurks have not fired any big shells today. The New Zealand Howitzer Battery is giving the Turks trenches particular attention today. We had a few casualties from shrapnel. They usually get one or two every day\n","226":"\n\nAeroplanes again. Ours was first up. After it was out of sight a Lowber made his appearance at great height and flying rapidly as usual. Our guns are bombarding the Turks trenches again especially the \"Chess Board and \"Johnson’s Jolly\". 2nd Bgde relieved us out of our trenches about 12 PM.\n","227":"\n\nMy first scratch\n\nWounded in right arm with shrapnel. Only a fine graze. Our guns opened up on the Turks trenches early in the morning. About 4.30 PM they opened an intensive bombardment and at 5.30 our Batt charged over the parapets, ran over the first and 2nd lines of their trenches, rooted the Turks out and began to work hard to make trenches so as to prevent a counter attack.\n","228":"\n\nFine We worked all last night and are still working. The Turkish losses are heavy. We are on the right wing and they are trying to bomb us out, but we are holding our own. (The New Zealanders have successfully pushed through the Chessboard\"). The information was wrong as they did not get through.\n","229":"\n\nFine Firing still continues. (The New Zealanders have got the Turks on the run and driven them back about two miles which is quite a record for trench fighting.) Our Navy is firing high explosive shells into the Turks on the hill on the left. It is this hill that the N.Z’s have practically captured\n","230":"\n\nCool Flies not quite so troublesome. We are holding our new positions. I am pleased to say. Our losses are heavy. Out of 243 men in my company who charged over the parapets, only 36 came back , some of these being slightly wounded. We have captured many rifles, much ammunition and a large number of prisoners.\n","231":"\n\nFine. I have taken over the duties of Orderly to Lieut. Taylor. Turks counter attacked on hill \n9\n No. 971 but were repulsed with heavy losses. The rifle and machine gun fire was heavy. Our guns opened a heavy fire on the Turks also. The positions we have won are secure.\n","232":"\n\nFine. Had a good nights rest. Rather a quiet morning, but towards evening a terrific rifle and machine gun fire could be heard on our left flank. Our artillery roaring and echoing along all the ridges.\n","233":"\n\nBeautiful morning. An occasional shot from rifle and canon is to be heard. B. Coy in our Batt. was only able to muster 15 men after the charge. We are having 48 hours rest after doing 48 in the fire trench..\n","234":"\n\nHot again. Turks heavily bombarded our trenches, but did no damage beyond burying a couple of chaps and raising an awful dust.. It is terribly fatiguing work in the trenches now we are all done up with our long stay in here and look forward to relief by the next Division.\n","235":"\n\nFine Quiet so far except for the snipers cracking now and again. Have just taught a dare devil Turk to keep his head down. Cannot say whether I knocked him or not. He was showing head and shoulders above the trench carrying sand bags for his parapet\n","236":"\n\nFine Lovely mornings, getting warm towards mid-day with cool evenings. The nights get chilly and we have to beware of colds. Our Batt. was relieved from trenches this afternoon by the 4th Batt.\n","237":"\n\nFine. All had a peaceful nights rest out here in support trenches. No \n\"Standing to\"\n in the morning about 4 AM when a chap feels that he wants to sleep most, and no sleeping in equipment so that we can make ourselves comfortable when turning in\n","238":"\n\nFine Today is the Anniversary of our Batt. the day when it began to be formed at Kensington Racecourse. We came into the trenches again at 12 noon. We are fairly well dug in now.\n\n \n","239":"\n\nFine. Nothing to record. The same old monotonous \"lookouts\" up on the parapets the same sniping the same guns banging and knocking our a parapets about \n\"Drat ‘em\"\n we get enough to do without always building up parapets.\n","240":"\n\nCloudy cool. Big drops of rain fell last night and have been threatening to fall all day. Borrowed a halfcrown off private Duffy to get a few luzuries off the \"Canteen ship\". The Major went down to try & get the articles for us but found that it contained nothing. No stores on board.\n\n \n","241":"\n\nWe are still holding on to the trenches which we captured on the 6th. The Turks are always throwing bombs at us, as they are only about 15 yds away in some places. They seldom do any damage though. Now and then they knock somebody over. Their quick – firers do more damage than any of their weapons.\n","242":"\n\nFine. Once more ready to go in the old trenches. The men had dinner there as it was nearly 12 noon. Turks bombed our trench a lot but did no damage. Great to do on the left. The 9th army Corps (British) took two lines trenches & the N.Z’s took one and they are holding them.\n","243":"\n\nFine . An English howitzer battery behind our lines is pumping high explosives into the Turks trenches and also shrapnel on to where they think the enemies’ guns are. The enemy replies with shrapnel from his quick firers, doing no damage.\n","244":"\n\nWindy Threatening rain. Turks threw bombs a treat last night to no effect though. Our chaps have them thinking seriously when they throw a gun – cotton bomb on to the Turk’s trench. We left the trench again at 2 PM to go out for 48 hours rest.\n","245":"\n\nDusty. Have spent part of the 48 hours rest digging a dugout for Lieut. Taylor and am now pleased to say that I have now finished. Received three more welcome letters and a paper from home.\n","246":"\n\nDull. A heavy bombardment is going on at Cape Helles by our Warships. It is quiet in our position just now. We have had three Coy. and our fourth is now having his innings. His name is Walker \n\n \n","247":"\n\nCool. A heavy bombard preceded on attack by our chaps on the left. Results of the attack have not come through officially. The capture of a couple of howitzers by our lads is reported. The enemy shelled our trenches considerably about 5 PM\n","248":"\n\nCool. Cloudy. A couple of Taube aeroplanes were seen above our trenches yesterday evening. They did not stay long though.\n","249":"\n\nCool Some of our lads have just returned after being wounded. A good deal of firing is going on over at the left. They have not settled down after the attack, evidently expecting another one. Our lads won an important position although losing heavily.\n","250":"\n\nFine. Am now assisting the Company Q. M.S. as well as looking after Mr Taylor. I am not to go into the firing line by the Majors orders. We have had a number of luzuries given us by the Regimental fund as well as cigarettes and tobacco from the Victoria Racing Club\n\n \n","251":"\n\nWarm day Had a good night’s rest. Rather a quiet day except for a few shells and bombs in the evening. One shell unfortunately killed two of our stretcher bearers, one being literally blown to pieces\n","252":"\n\nFine.\n German aeroplanes are busy overhead. One dropped several bombs on our gun positions. A lot of talk about a relief for us I Will be very disappointed if we do not get ours soon\n","253":"\n\nCool Wind Our first touch of winter is now on us. One of our transports has been torpedoed with troops on board. She got into Murdross Harbor Lemnos Island safely though. There were very few casualties.\n","254":"\n\nCool. We went into Lone Pine again at 12 PM and relieved the 4th Batt. The Turks got a \"75\" on to our Coy. H.Q. and wounded the telephone operator. I have had to take his place, being a Coy Signaller. I did a four hour watch on this instead of observing during the night.\n","255":"\n\nFine I believe I am to go on Batt. H.Q. as they are short of H.Q. \"Sigs\". Did another shift at the phone. Needless to say we have another place for the \"phone\" now. The beggars shelled us out of the other one. Our artillery gave them some hurry up this afternoon\n","256":"\n\nCool breeze from the North. Blows a lot of dust about. Turks are very quiet today. They usually open up with their small arms about 5.30 P.M. and also with bombs about 3 AM. We have been ordered to be prepared for an attack from them any time. I think myself that \"Jackie \"realises this to be too costly though. \n","257":"\n\nCool.
