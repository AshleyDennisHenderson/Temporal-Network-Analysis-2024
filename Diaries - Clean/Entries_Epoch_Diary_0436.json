Quiet Day in Hospital. Major O’Brien here as a convalescent. He had a long talk with me.\n\nPicture Show at night.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that whilst our Drs. &amp; Sisters here are doing a noble work, gaining undying gratitude from Thousands of men, there is a great tendency to create among the patients a good number of malingerers. The cost of running these large Hotels such as Heliopolis, Ghizira &amp; Al Hayat must be enourmous to the military. From the Basement to the roof one finds every comfort &amp; convenience. The Collonade itself is a picture &amp; every thought must be given to Patrons in Peace times. Only those with large incomes can possibly hope to have access in these buildings. On arrival the patient hands over all His Clothes which is examined &amp; if worn out is burned. The remainder is thoroughly disinfected &amp; laid by. A full supply is immediately forthcoming when the patient leaves. The Basements of these Buildings are Huge Store Houses where Kits &amp; other belongings of men are Guarded &amp; cared for.\n","2":"\n\nChurch Service today, not feeling too bright. Wrote Home also to Col. Fuller.\n\nOld Soldiers in Hospital are a source of real trouble &amp; annoyance to the medical Profession in so far as to let the novice into the tricks of securing a passage Home. Among this common dodges patients make up small rolls or Balls of ordinary Soap, &amp; then \ncut\n swallow same. The result is that the Heart beats furiusly &amp; the temperature rises, &amp; the Drs. are at a loss to know how to treat the invalid, the result is Discharged Malinger.\n","3":"\n\nDaily Examination by Dr., raining all day, large numbers of men both coming &amp; going each day.\n\nOthers patients try to sham Deafness &amp; loss of voice, &amp; back ache. Others again try to be insane, whilst a goodly number inflict Bodily Harm by shooting themselves in the Hand or feet. The penalty if caught is severe, but many still try the old dodges &amp; some get through.\n","4":"\n\nExamined by Dr. today – asked to be allowed to leave &amp; return to Regiment. Granted. I went to Maadi &amp; saw Col. Fuller who willingly agreeded to take me back as His Batman, returned to Hospital at 7 p.m. The thought of getting away from Hospital Life is pleasant, for though they treated me Hansomely, too much of a good thing becomes tiresome. This Large German Hotel is certainly very handy for convalesents who soon get strong after a few weeks of good food &amp; gentle exercise.\n","5":"\n\nGot my discharge from Helouan Al-Hayat Con. Home. Came direct to Maadi Camp &amp; took up my Duties with Col. Fuller. He occupies a one roomed stone Hut built by Lieu Chisholm. Everything in Camp is upside down owing to Regiment just arriving in from Oasis Camp at Heliopolis. Letters arrived from Home &amp; Mrs. Robson &amp; Miss Sarginson.\n\nThere are very few of the Old Hands now in Camp, as many have returned to Aus. or died at the Front.\n","6":"\n\nRegimental parade. Col. Fuller in Camp all day.\n\nI went into Cairo to see Cooks re Luggage Kit Bag, that is at Alex for Officers.\n\nWhen on the Peninsula all Kit Bags &amp; Valises were returned to Base, as General Birdwood refused Officers the privileges of having extra comforts. This was done because we so often moved from different points suddenly, &amp; the men of course had to carry not only their own, but the Officers as well.\n","7":"\n\nWrote to Cook &amp; Sons re Officers Kit lying there.\n\nMajor O’Brien came from Helonan to attend Board.\n\nRaining all night.\n\nIt is suprising the Quantity of Articles brought over by the Officers that remain at the different Agents around Cairo, quite useless for active service. Cook &amp; other Bulk Stores are reaping a Harvest these days owing to the unnecessary baggage that the Officers &amp; Men accumulate.\n","8":"\n\nWent into Cairo for Col. Fuller’s Valise &amp; Suit Case. Met Mr. Trapp who is connected with the remount Depot. He told me that his Wife has just died. Took him to Intermediate Base to send cable home.\n\nDuring the year all Remount men have been collected and returned to Australia to be discharged. When we evacuated Gallipoli there was no further use for any old or defective person as we took charge of our own Horses &amp; could readily absorb all reinforcements there would arrive. It meant the saving of a large sum of money in discharging these men who were of no value for active Service.\n\nThe Rations as supplyed by the Military for our Horses is of a first Class nature. The variety as well as Quantity shows that much thought &amp; attention has been given to give the Animals the best food for Desert work. The Horses have acquired the taste, &amp; relish the water that is drawn from the numerous well found on the desert &amp; together with the rich food supplyed leave the Animals in first Class condition.\n\nSunday 9 January 1916\n\nCol. Fuller in Cairo to meet Col. Cox – took spurs in.\n\nChurch Parade.\n\nVery little information can be gained as to what the 1st L.H. Brigade purposes doing, but as the Jeunisses are troublesome on the Western Front we gather that the L.H. is to partrol &amp; Quell any disturbance.

A few are Brillant, whilst the majority only moderate. The shooting at Anzac did not tend to make 1st Class shots of the men owing doubtless to the fact that many of the targets were myths, &amp; noise was necessary as much as anything to keep in Check Jacko.\n","13":"\n\nRegiment on Parade under Col.

On the sides are to be seen images &amp; Egyptian writings, &amp; occasionally notches cut in enabling the visitor to climb like a fly to some other Tomb above. However most of us were satisfied to just enter the King &amp; Queen Death Chamber &amp; allow the Guide to ignite a Flare so the full dimensions could be taken in.

In traveling on long journeys these people generally carry their grave clothes with them in case they die before their return. If crossing the desert one of the number is about to die, He digs Himself a shallow grave, puts on His Grave Clothes, covers Himself as much as possible just leaving His Head uncovered &amp; then waits for Death, hoping that the Wind will complete the covering after He has gone. If the man dies in a House, there is much wailing for about an hour, by His friends, after which the \"Washer of the Dead\" comes &amp; prepares the corpse for Burial.

A number of Turks &amp; Camels were watering at the well, &amp; on the approach of the 7th Reg. made off, ony one Turk &amp; Camel were captured. The general opinion is that some one made a hash of the Show, &amp; that not only all the Enemy &amp; Animals ought to have been taken, but the Brigade should have launched out &amp; had a ‘go’ at a number of Turks who had congregated about 3 miles to the North: nothing was done however, &amp; the Troops returned to \nRomani\n about 5 p.m. after practicalally doing no good.

No news of any sort reaching us, & it looks as though the Division have removed the Brigade from active use for some reason or another. The root of the trouble is Personal Enemity between the Heads & the stronger power crushes the weaker. To become popular either in Social or Military Life the performers must play to the Gallery, & woebetide those in subordinate positions if they refuse to knuckle down. We have in our Brigade men who in Private life control wealth & public opinion, & naturally they kick against bowing to men of Inferior Station, though for the time being they occupy higher places in military life. Unless a radical change takes place in the near future I can only see not only a rupture, but a complete severance of High Officials. This appears to be what is really happening as we hear that our Brigade is being taken over by another General by the name of Watson & will form part of the Northern Section.\n\nEnquiry hel\n","341":"\n\nCol.
