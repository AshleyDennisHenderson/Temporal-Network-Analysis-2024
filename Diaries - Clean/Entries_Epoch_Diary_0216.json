The Brigadier took theProtestant Denominations of the Military Contingent on the WellDeck Aft; Commander Stevenson took the Navy people on the Well Deck For'd, and the Brigade Major (Major Heritage) conducted the Roman Catholic Service - Navy and Military united - on the Boat Deck.\n\nImmediately after Church Parade the P.M.O. carried out a second inoculation against Typhoid of the Military Contingent.\n\nAt 11-45 a.m. the Machine Gun Box containing spare parts, which had been removed from the Isolation Hospital, was reported as found, and a further examination of the plan found in the Aft Latrine, and mentioned in yesterday's diary, proved to be a plan of the Latrine arrangements on the Hospital Ship \"Aorangi\", and had evidently been left by someone while our Ship was at Cockatoo.\n\nDuring the afternoon the men were issued the following equipment:-\n\nHelmet.\n\nKnife.\n\n'Housewife'.\n\nTooth & Hair Brushes.\n\nComb.\n\nWhitsunday passage passed at 5-0 p.m.\n\nThe P.M.O. reports that there are no serious cases of sickness although about 185 minor cases were reported.\n\n(Church Parade, Sunday 23\/8\/14)\n\nCHURCH SERVICE:\n\nHYMNS:\n(No. 165.)\n\nO GOD, our help in ages past,\n Our hope for years to come,\nOut shelter from the stormy blast,\n And our eternal home.\n\nBeneath the shadow of thy Throne,\n Thy Saints have dwelt secure;\nSufficient is Thine Arm alone,\n And our defence is sure.\n\nO God, our help in ages past,\n Our hope for years to come,\nBe thou our guard while troubles last\n And our eternal home.\n\n(No. 166)\n\nALL people that on earth do dwell,\n Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;\nHim serve with fear, His praise forth tell,\n Come ye before him, and rejoice.\n\nThe Lord, ye, know, is God indeed;\n Without our aid He did us make;\nWe are His flock, He doth us feed,\n Are for His sheep He doth us take.\n\nTo Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\n The God Whom Heav'n and earth adore,\nFrom men and from the Angel-host\n Be praise and glory evermore.\n\nSaturday - 22nd August 1914:\nCompany training was carried out until noon, at which time an inspection of the ship was made by the Brigadier and Captain (Commander Stevenson). No training was done during theafternoon,but, following the usual custom of the Navy when at sea, an opportunity was afforded the men for washing their clothes and repairing same.\n\nAt 4-30 p.m. a lecture on \"Fire Direction and Control\" was delivered by the Brigade Major (Major Heritage) to all Officers on the ship.\n\nAt 8-0 p.m. a Concert was held on the Well Deck Aft under the supervision of W.O. Wilkinson, Brigade Sgt. Major.\n\nDuring the day vaccination against Small-pox of all men requiring to be treated was carried out by the P.M.O.\n\nThis morning Lieut.-Col. Watson reported that on the previous day a box containing spare parts belonging to one of the machine guns had been removed from the Isolation Hospital, where all this equipment was stored. The place was not kept locked because of a patient being in the Hospital, where all this equipment was stored. The place was not kept locked because of a patient being in the Hospital, but a sentry had been placed over the equipment. This sentry reported that a man in uniform (whom he did not know) came to him saying he had been sent for the box; he believed him and allowed him to remove the same. Col. Watson stated that a very thorough search had been made but without success. The search was, however, being continued.\n\nAbout 9-0 p.m. the Brigade Major informed me that a plan had been found by one of the men in the aft latrine, showing the arrangements for flooding the magazine of the ship. This circumstance, together with the incident of the machine gun box, raised suspicion that all was not right. After consultation with the Naval Captain in Charge, I decided to increase the sentries, and the Navy people placed a sentry on each gun so as to prevent any interference with the 'Sights' or other removable parts.\n\nAt mid-night the Ship had sailed 284 nautical miles, plus 54 under Local Pilot, making a grand total of 338 nautical miles from moorings in Moreton Bay.\n\nFriday - 21st August 14:\nActing on instructions received by wireless, the ship put in to Moreton Bay at 5-0 a.m., to await receipt of despatches arriving by the Brisbane Mail Train for H.M.A.S. \"Sydney\".\n\nIt was reported to me that it was doubtful whether mess tins requisitioned for in Sydney by the Ordnance Department, and supposed to have put on board, were really on the ship. These were included in the issue voucher from Ordnance, and the Quarter-master was assured by the Ordnance that these articles had been placed upon the Lighter at Central Wharf and sent up to the dock.\n\nAs it was most important to have these mess tins, I despatched a boat to the Pile Light in Morton Bay, with a telephone message to the District Commandant, Brisbane, informing him of the circumstances and asking him to send to the ship before 10-0 p.m. 1,043 mess tins.\n\nAt about 8-0 p.m. I received a signal from the Pile Light enquiring whether the number of mess tins required was 1,043, and I replied that this number was correct. Later on I received another signal message from the Navy Department asking to be informed whether the mess tins required were of the Naval or Military pattern; I replied \"the usual Military mess tins\", and suggested reference to the District Commandant who would know what was required.\n\nDuring the day Navy Contingent and the Ship's crew were inoculated against Typhoid and an examination made of all men requiring to be vaccinated against Small-pox. Instruction was carried out by all Units.\n\nAt 11-0 p.m. a boat from the pilot steamer \"Otter\" came along side and Mr. Lyng came aboard with despatches from Melbourne for delivery to H.M.A.S. \"Sydney\".\n\nCertain Naval stores were requisitioned for by telephone from the Navy Office, Brisbane, at the same time as I despatched my message for mess tins, were received, but no mess tin arrived nor was any explanation received as to why they were not despatched; and although I received a private letter from Colonel Lee, District Commandant, no mention whatever was made of the mess tins. I concluded, therefore, that the Navy Office, Brisbane, which received my message about the mess tins, did not convey same to the Commandant.\n\nAll the stores in the holds of the ship, which were taken in very hurriedly immediately before the ship left the dock at Cockatoo, are being re-arranged and checked with the lists received from the Ordnance Department of stores supposed to have been placed on board, and I hope that the mess tins in question will be found, but as there was a doubt about it, I considered it advisable to ask for a double supply rather than risk departing without any.\n\nAt 11-30 p.m. the ship sailed from Moreton Bay.\n\nTo-day received for the first time list showing total strength of the Naval Contingent on board, viz:-\n\nOfficers ...............25\nPetty Officers.......36\nMen....................410\nTotal...................471\n\n-over-\n\n\n\n(2)\n\nThe detailed statement, together with composition of Brigade Staff, Naval Staff, Battalion and Company Officers, is as follows:-\n\nTotal strength of Brigade (Naval):\n\nOfficers\n\nStaff\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nBrigade Leaders\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n18\n\nTotal 25.\n\nPetty Officers\n\nStaff\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructors of Companies\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n24\n\nTotal 36\n\nMen\n\nStaff\n\nNil\n\n\n\n\n\nunattached\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n401\n\nTotal 410\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Total 471\n\nStaff Officers and Ratings\n\nBrigade Staff:\n\nBattalion Staff:\n\nCommander Stevenson.\n\nCommander Browne.\n\nPaymaster Livesay.\n\nCommander Elwell.\n\nPetty Officer Blackmore.\n\nCompany Officers:\n\nOfficer's Std.

Owing to the choppy nature of the sea many men were temporarily incapacitated, and the rolling of the ship interfered to a certain extent with the work.\n\nAt 11-0 a.m. the four 4.7 guns were fired to test mountings, which proved satisfactory.\n\nAt 4-30 p.m. the Brigade Major delivered a lecture to all Officers on fire discipline.\n\nThe P.M.O. reported that there were no serious cases of sickness, one man having a slight attack of Pneumonia.\n\nAt mid-night the ship had sailed 282 nautical miles for the 24 hours, making a total of 412 miles.\n\nWednesday: 19th August 14:\n\nShip undocked at 6-0 a.m. and proceeded to the Flag Ship's Buoy at Farm Cove. At about 11-) a.m. received further despatch from Melbourne, together with a number of plans and other documents.\n\nAt 12-15 p.m. ship moved out from Farm Cove on her voyage.\n\nOrders for the general discipline of the ship were issued.\n\nAt mid-night the Ship had sailed North 130 nautical miles.\n\nTuesday - 18th August 14:\n\nTroops marched from Agricultural Ground at 10-20 a.m. via Randwick Road, Flinders Street, College Street and Macquarie Street to Fort Macquarie, which was reached at 11-40 a.m. Here the members of the Force were conveyed to the Troop Ship at Garden Island.\n\nAt 11-45 a.m. I received information from Lieut. Howell-Price, A. & I. S., that the Prime Minister desired to see the District Commandant and myself. I at once visited the Commonwealth Offices at Customs House and saw Senator Millen, who expressed himself dissatisfied at so many married men being taken with the Force. He anticipated difficulties would arise after the men got away in providing for their wives and families. He said he had given explicit instructions that preference was to be given to single men, but instead of this he found a large number of married men had been accepted. I explained the system of enrolling and attesting, and pointed out that the enrolling and medical examination were carried out in Victoria Barracks, after which the men were sent to me merely for organisation, and that I had no voice whatever in the selection of the men, but accepted those sent me with the exception of a few which were culled out.\n\nSenator Millen also said that he considered we should have gone away earlier. I pointed out that the first section of the men did not arrive at the Agricultural Ground until Tuesday, 11th August so that the Force had to be enrolled, attested, organised, equipped, clothed and armed and placed aboard the Troop Ship within one week. I therefore expressed surprise at his complaint of dilatoriness. He stated that he quite recognised the force of my remarks and said he had no fault to find with the organisation of the Force, but he considered it should have left Australia earlier, but as this was a matter entirely outside of my control I did not pursue the subject further.\n\nThe whole Force was got on board the Troop Ship by 1-30 p.m., and here also the Naval Contingent reported.\n\nAlthough it was originally intended that the Force should sail in the evening, it was found that the last punt load of supplies for the Troop Ship would not leave Central Wharf until after 4-0 p.m., so that it would be impossible for the ship to leave that evening. Commander Stevenson, Officer Commanding H.M.A.S \"Berrima\", informed me that he proposed to undock the Ship at 5-30 next morning.\n\nAt 5-0 p.m. the Orderly Officer to the District Commandant brought to me a communication from the Chief of the General Staff, notifying the necessity for taking with me an Intelligence Officer and instructing me to equip that Officer withe necessary instruments, etc. to enable him to make sketches and surveys of places visited by the Expedition. Detailed instructions were also received of the work required to be done by this Officer. I at once selected Captain Travers for this position and sent him ashore to obtain all the instruments and materials he required for his work; directing him to report on board at Farm Cove at 10-0 a.m. next day as I had received word that the Ship would not leave Sydney pending the arrival by next day's Mail Train of an important despatch.\n\nIt might be noted here that I anticipated work of this character would be required, and Captain Travers had made application to the Officer Commanding the Intelligence Corps of New South Wales for the loan of instruments, etc. but I was informed these could not be spared and that if I would submit a list of my requirements they would be purchased by the Intelligence Corps.\n\n-over-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\nReceived the following message from His Excellency,\nThe Governor General:-\n\"I wish all success to the First Australian Contingent to embark, and am confident it will give a good account of itself.\"\n\nSuitable reply despatched by wire.\n\nP.M.O. reported to me at 5-0 p.m. that a man (Pvt. W.C. Dunham, 'F' Coy.) was suffering from Epilepsy; he admitted to Captain Donaldson, A.M.C., that he was subject to Epileptic Fits and had therefore made a false declaration in his attestation. He was sent ashore to Sydney Hospital.\n\nMonday: 17th August 1914:\n\nOrganisation of Force proceeding, as well as drilling and training of the men. In the afternoon pay was issued, and at 4-0p.m. the Force paraded for inspection by His Excellency, The Governor.\n\nOn the arrival of the Mail from Melbourne, I received preliminary instructions from the Chief of the General Staff, together with some plans and intelligence reports.\n\nAuthority was received from Head Quarters for Lieut. Goadby, R.A.E. to accompany Expedition. This Officer reported for duty at 11-0 a.m.\n\nSunday: 16th August 14:\n\nThe Roman Catholic members of the Force were allowed to leave Camp and attend early service, and at 9-0 a.m. Church of England service was carried out under the Dean of Sydney, and also another united service for the other Protestant Denominations.\n\nIn the afternoon the training of the Troops was continued in Moore Park.\n\nSaturday: 15th August 14:\n\nThe organisation of the Force proceeded, and some additional men were attested.\n\nIn addition to his duties as Intelligence Officer, Captain Travers was appointed to act as Pay-master, and directed to place himself into communication with the District Pay-master, 2nd Military District, for further instructions, and to obtain the necessary forms, documents, etc. This he did, and arrangements were made to pay all ranks up to and including Monday, 17th instant.\n\nAt 4-0 p.m. the whole Force paraded for inspection by the Brigadier, and the District Commandant (Col. Wallack) advised me that he had approved of the list of Officers as submitted and would forward same to Head Quarters, Melbourne, for concurrence and gazettal.\n\nArrangements with Dean of Sydney, and Rev. Colwell, Moderator Methodist Assemblies, for Church Parades on the following day.\n\n\n\nFriday - 14th August 14:\n\nAt 8-30 a.m. received information (unofficially) that the Naval Officers engaged fitting up S.S. \"Berrima\" had been instructed to cease all operations on board, and to take the boat to Central Wharf to get her under steam ready to embark Troops same evening.\n\nAt 9-30 a.m. Commander Robbins communicated with me by telephone from Garden island, enquiring whether I had received any instructions about embarking that evening. I suggested that he should communicate with the District Commandant, as on the previous evening I had been speaking to the Chief of the General Staff - Col. Legge at Melbourne - by telephone up to 10-0 p.m., and he made no mention whatever of a probable early embarkation, but on the contrary rather gave me to understand that the embarkation would not take place until about Tuesday, 18th August. In the evening I received a communication from Victoria Barracks that the Force was not to embark that evening but that Tuesday, 18th August, at about 12 noon, had been fixed for this movement.\n\nSix (6) recruits (additional) for the Infantry Battalion and 20 for the A.M.C. Unit were attested and passed in.\n\nIn view of the probably of embarking at once, the issue of clothing, equipment, arms, etc. was expedited and the whole issued, so that, if necessary, the Force could be embarked that evening.\n\nThe following Officers were selected for Contingent and names submitted to the District Commandant as under:-\n\nBrigade:\nColonel W. Holmes; D.S.O., V.D.\nLieut. Col. Howse N.R.; V.C.\nCapt. Travers A.R.J.\nLieut. Holmes B.\n\nBattalion:\nLieut. Col. Russell Watson; V.D.\nLieut. Col. Paton J; V.D.\nCapt. Lane C. Adjutant.\nCapt.

Bruce H.L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndo Chambers L.K.\n\n\n\nThursday: 13th August 14:\n\nFifty-three (53) additional recruits were attested and passed in, making a total of 1,106. Equipment from the Ordnance Stores and supplies began to arrive, and was issued as received. Consideration was given to the selection of Company Officers. Complete Medical Unit reported and commenced duty.\n\nCaptain Hercus was selected for one Machine-Gun Section and Sgt.-Major Marsden for the other. They at once set to work to organise these Sections.\n\nAt 4-0 p.m. saw all the Officers who were applicants for Commissions with the force, and who had been allotted temporarily to Companies.\n\nDuring the day the majority of the men were inoculated against typhoid, and arrangements were made to have the remainder inoculated the following day.\n\nWednesday: 12th August 14:\n\nThe work of attesting men arriving at Victoria Barracks was proceeded with all day, the total number sworn in being 723, making a grand total of 1,053 to date. All the men were allowed to return to their homes and directed to report at 9 o'clock the following morning, 13th August.\n\nCaptain Goodsell, Area Officer, was appointed Quarter-master of the Battalion, and at once commenced the duties of the position, and prepared the necessary requisitions for stores supplies and other requirements.\n\nSteps were also taken to appoint the necessary permanent staff of Non-commissioned Officers. Staff Sgt.-Major Wilkinson was selected as Brigade Sgt.-Major, and Staff Sgt.-Major Inglis as Regimental Sgt.-Major.\n\nMr, Keith Heritage was appointed Transport Officer.\n\nTuesday - 11th August 14:\n\nVisited Royal Agricultural Society's Grounds at 8-45 a.m., and took over the grounds and buildings for used by the Contingent, and made arrangements for Brigade and Regimental Offices etc.\n\nAt 2-0 p.m. the applicants for service who had been enrolled and medically examined at the Victoria Barracks began to arrive, and during the afternoon 330 men were duly attested and handed over temporarily to certain Company Officers.\n\nAs no arrangements had been made for sleeping accommodation or messing, the men were allowed to return to their homes in the evening, but were directed to report themselves at 9-0 a.m. the following day.\n\nMajor MacNaughten, who had accepted the position of Adjutant and commenced duty, informed me about 3-30 p.m. that he desired to relinquish the position as Colonel McLaurin desired him to accompany his Brigade with the larger Expeditionary Force. This I approved, and Captain C.H.D. Lane, Militia Adjutant, 21st Infantry, was appointed temporarily to the position.\n\nI was advised personally by P.M.O.Col. Fiaschi that Major N.R.

Proceeded to Barracks immediately and was informed by the Commandant that it was intended to at once organise a Force, consisting of one Battalion of Infantry and 500 Blue Jackets, with proper complement of Army Medical Unit, to be ready for Foreign service within 6 days. The Commandant then offered me the Command of the Expedition, which I at once accepted. The Commandant asked me to nominate my Infantry Battalion Commander, and I at once mentioned the name of Lieut.-Col. Russell Watson, and asked to be granted time until 2-0 p.m. to afford me an opportunity of consulting Col. Watson. This was agreed to.\n\nAt 12-0 noon saw Lieut.-Col. Watson and offered him the Battalion Command, which he accepted.\n\n2-0 p.m. Again visited Commandant and formally nominated Lieut.-Col. Watson for the position. The Commandant then informed me that I would have practically a free hand in the selection of the Officers accompanying me, with the exception of the Naval Unit, which was being organised by the Naval Department, which he understood was being drawn from several States of the Commonwealth and would be handed over to me as a complete Unit on the day of sailing. He also advised me that arrangements had been made with the Royal Agricultural Society to grant me the exclusive use of the Show Grounds at Moore Park for organising the detachment.\n\nAt 3-0 p.m. visited Randwick Rifle Range and interviewed Major F.B. Heritage, Commandant, School of Musketry, and offered him the position of Brigade Major, which he at once accepted.\n\nImmediately afterwards visited Agricultural Grounds and arranged for the use of buildings and offices required for the staff, and the housing and messing of the men.\n\nThe other members of the Brigade Staff selected were:-\n- A.D.C. - Lieut.

HOLMES, D.S.O., V.D.\n\nFORTNIGHT ENDED - SUNDAY 6\/9\/1914: \n\n\n\nSunday - 6th September 1914:\n\nEarly morning parade: All Units were engaged on general fatigue. Church Parade was held, Lieut. McLaghlan (Infantry) taking the Roman Catholics at 10-45 a.m. on the Flying Deck, while the Chaplain from the \"Encounter\" (the Rev. Stewart) conducted the service of the Protestant Denominations at 11-0 a.m. on the Well Deck Aft.\n\nAfternoon parade: Making and mending.\n\n7-0 a.m. Mesage was received from the \"Warrego\" that the Company of Troops on shore from the \"Kanowna\" will be on board that ship at 3-30 p.m.\n\n9-25 a.m. The following message was received from the \"Sydney\":-\n\"Captain to Brigadier\"\n\"Can you inform me why draft from \"Kanowna\" to \"Sydney\" has been cancelled. I have no information\"\n\nAt 9-55 a.m. a reply was sent as follows:-\nBerrima\" to \"Sydney\"\nArrangements made for 50 Naval Reserve from \"Berrima\" to \"Sydney\" in conformity with last night's instructions from R.A.C. that the draft was to be from Troops that are to ultimately occupy Herbertshohe.\"\n\nAt 10-10 a.m. a further message was received from the \"Sydney\" as under:-\n\"Re draft; thank you. I should like them sent over at daylight to-morrow.\"\n\nThe detachment consisted of 3 Officers and 50 men of the Naval Reserve under Lieut. Bowen, together with Capt. Pockley and one private from A.M.C. and an ample supply of medical and surgical equipment. Six days rations for the whole detachment and 150 rounds of ammunition per rifle were taken.\n\nThe following general message was issued at 11-55 a.m.:-\n\"Squadron will sail at 8-0 to-morrow morning. Steam for working cables at 7-30 a.m., steam for 12 knots at 8-0 a.m. Order of sailing - \"Sydney\", \"Berrima\", \"Kanowna\", \"Encounter\", \"Aorangi\"; Submarines with \"Sydney\", Destroyers as convenient.\"\n\n2-30 p.m. The Brigadier, accompanied by the Brigade Major, went on board the \"Kanowna\" to inspect the Troops. The Brigadier considers the whole Unit absolutely unfitted for active service and has recommended that they not be taken further but returned at once to the State to which they belong. The Unit consists of 4 Companies; there was no Regimental Staff and Lieut. Fry from \"A\" Company 1st Infantry has been appointed Adjutant with temporary rank of Captain to repair this omission. The Officers, with two exceptions, are inexperienced and have had very little training; 7 of the 13 are 21 years of age and under; no Non-commissioned Officers have been appointed; The Unit consists of 1\/3rd Trainees and 2\/3rd Rifle Club Members - many of the former exhibited very poor physical development, and the Medical Officer on board stated that some of the men were unfitted for service, suffering from Varicocele, Hernia, etc. The men were in possession of only one\n\n(over)\n\n\n\n\n\nTroopship \"Berrima\",\nFairfax Harbour,\nPort Moresby,\n6th September 1914.\n\nFrom - Officer Commanding Naval & Military Expedition:\nTo - The Rear-Admiral Commanding Australian Squadron:\n\nTo-day I made an inspection of the whole of the Officers,Non-commissioned Officers, and men of the Infantry Contingent now on board the Troopship \"Kanwowna\", and regret to have to report that I consider the whole Unit absolutely unfitted for active service, and recommend that theynot be taken further but returned at once to the State to which they belong.\n\nMy reasonsfor arriving at this conclusion are as follows: -\n\n(1) The Officer in Command has had very little Military training or experience, and, in addition, lacks personality and self-reliance.\n\n(2) There is no Regimental Staff; to repair this omission I have been obliged to detail an Officer from the \"Berrima\" to act as Adjutant.\n\n(3) The Unit consists of four Companies, but only two of theseare commanded by Captains who have 8 years and 6½ years Commissioned service respectively. The other two Companies are Commanded, one by a 1st Lieutenant of only two year Commissioned service and the other by a 2nd Lieutenant of a few months service.\nIn \"D\" Company the threeOfficers are 2nd Lieutenants.\nOf the the 13 Officers 7 are 21 years of age and under, of but a few months service each.\n\n(4) There is only one permanent Staff N.C.O., who acts as Regimental Sergt. Major.\n\n(5) Although the Contingent has been on service for three weeks, no Non-commissioned Officers have yet been appointed, but a few men are acting.\n\n(6) The Unit consists of 1\/3rd Trainees under the Commonwealth Universal Training System, and 2\/3rds Rifle Club Members. Some of the former are immature lads under\n(over)\n\n(2)\n\n-under-\n18 years of age, although I understood the instructions provided for men of the Naval & Military Expedition being between the ages of 19 and 39 years.\n\n(7) Many of these young men exhibit very poor physical development, and in my opinion could not do a day's march as Soldiers, particularly in the Tropics.\n\n(8) The Medical Officer of board informed me that some of the men suffer from Varicocele, Varicose Veins, Thrombosis and Hernia, and were unfit for service.\n\n(9) The men are possessed of only one suit of clothing, which they have now been wearing for 3 weeks without a change.\n\n(10) Many of the men have been issued with ill-fitting, and in some cases odd, Boots; they have, therefore, been obliged to wear private Boots of a light pattern, which are nearly worn out. Some are wearing light elastic side Boots (Jemimas), while others are wearing and old pattern Regimental issue which are falling to pieces. Many men are now on their uppers and could not march 5 miles without discomfort, or worse.\n\n(11) The Unit is not provided with tents, hammocks, or mosquito nets.\n\n(12) Very little instruction has been given on board, while musketry instruction is conspicuous by its entire absence, not a shot having been fired.\n\n(13) The discipline on the Ship is unsatisfactory.\n\n(14) I understand the Ship was only provisioned to convey the Troops as far as Thursday Island; the result is that the short rations, of which 30 days supply only were taken on board, are now being drawn upon.\n\n(15) No provision whatever has been made on the Ship in the way of Mess Tables, and the men after receiving their meals, have to sit on the decks to eat same.\n\n(16) As there are no hammocks or bunks, most of the men sleep on the decks with only waterproof sheets and blankets.\n\nWH\nColonel\n\n(P.S.)

After seeing his report, I directed that Captain Kay be supplied with a few things urgently required and that his unit be fully equipped if it became detached for duty.\n\nOn September 6th 1914, I examined Captain Fernley, A.A.M.C., and found him suffering from hernia; he had be operated upon for hernia about seventeen months ago and only got return after violent exertion whilst on duty at Thursday Island.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that he was complaining of great pain, he agreed to still continue on light duty until it was convenient for him to return to Queensland for operative treatment.

Detail was composed of two officers and ten men, under the command of Captain Stuart Kay.\n\nIn my opinion, the stores and equipment of the Detail were totally inadequate to meet the medical requirements of the troops on active service.\n\nWhen Captain Kay reported to you on board the H.M.A.S. \"BERRIMA\" on the morning of 5th September 1914, he stated to you in my presence that his equipment was absolutely inadequate, that he had already used up most of his stores; that the materials which remained were insufficient for the needs of the troops, and requested that you should make good his deficiencies from your stores.\nAfter inspecting the stores, I recommend to you that we should supply two pounds of chloroform and one pint of tincture of iodine, to meet a surgical emergency, together with a set of dental forceps. This was done and a receiptobtained for these articles. I further recommend that he be adequately equipped as soon as the unit was detached for separate work.\n\nOn\n\n(2).\n\nOn the 6th September, at your request and in your presence, Iexamined Captain Fernley, A.A.M.C of the Queenslansd Detail. I found that he had the scar of an operation for inguinal hernia on the right side. The deeper parts of the abdominal wall in the region of the scar had yielded and the hernia had returned. Captain Fernley complained that it was causing him much pain and inconvenience. in my opinion, Captain Fernley was only fit for very light duty untill he could be returned to the base.\n\n(sgd) F.A.

Commander Beresford forwarded a detailed account of events of the 11th, 12th and 13th inst. The supposed advances of the Germans on the 13th at Herbertshohe proved to be only natives from the mission station near by out exercising. The Brigadier received a message from R.A.C. to confer with him with regard to the prisoners on board Flagship who were to be deported. The Brigadier arrived at the Flagship at 9-45 a.m.. From the Flagship he proceeded to Herbertshohe by motor boat, being accompanied by Commander Stevenson, and arrived there at 11-30 a.m. The Governor had arrived there at 10.30 a.m. and waited for the Brigadier. A long interview was held and theBrigadier finally put certain conditions to the Governor under which territory administered by him was to be surrendered. Time was allowed until Noon on Thursday, 17th inst., for the Governor to finally decide whether he will accept the conditions laid down. The Brigadier will again meet the Governor at Herbertshohe at the time stated to receive his answer. The Brigadier returned to the \"Berrima\" at the Pier, Rabaul, at 6-0 p.m.\n\nThe French Warship \"Montcalm\", with the French Admiral on board, arrived, took up anchorage in Simpsonhafen, and saluted the Port, which salute was returned by the \"Encounter\" - Time 3-0 p.m. The Brigadier has arranged to visit the French Admiral at 11-0 a.m. to-morrow.\n\nCaptain Lewin \"Encounter\" visited the Brigadier and conferred with him as to the date of commencing operations for the occupationof Friedrich Wilhelmshafen.\n\nThe \"Australia, \"Sydney\" and \"Melbourne\" left for Sydney this afternoon to escort the Australian Expedition to Europe.\n\nMONDAY - 14TH SEPTEMBER 1914:\n\nReport was received from Colonel Watson stating that he intended to advance on Toma at 5-0 a.m. under cover of the guns of the \"Encounter\". At 6-0 a.m. the \"Encounter\" shelled the ridge well. A message was received from the Flagship that the Governor General, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, had forwarded a message of congratulations to the Admiral, and the latter also congratulated the Brigadier. At 10-30 a.m. information was received that a force of about 400 Germans and 600 Natives was retiring from Baining towards Pondo or Torlu on the North West Coast (both places are in open Bight) where it is believed the \"Komet\", \"Planet\" and \"Cormorant\" are waiting to take them off to Friedrich Wilhelmshafen. They are supposed to have a considerable quantity of food stuffs and 350 head cattle. A road has been cut through South-west of the Baining Mountains and another one into these mountains. It is thought that this information is to a certain extent correct, but the size of the force considerably exaggerated.\n\nAt 11-0 a.m. the Rear-Admiral came on board and conferred with the Brigadier. It is the intention to send the \"Sydney\" around the North-west Coast to see if the foregoing information is correct, and from there she will she will proceed direct to Australia. Later the Flagship will leave for Australia, the \"Encounter\", Destroyers and Submarines remaining here. The Destroyers will later on make a thorough reconnaissance of the North-west Coast.\n\nInformation has also been received that signal communication by way of the North Daughter, Ratabul, Watom Is., Natava Point and Baining is being kept open. Lt.-Col. Paton is investigating this.\n\n6-30 p.m. Message received from Commander Beresford to the effect that no word had been received fromCol. Watson, and that the residents at Herbertshohe intimate they will receive no opposition as the enemy is retiring for many miles inland.\n\nDuring the day all the Government Officials at Rabaul were placed under arrest and sent on board \"Berrima\" under Brigadier's instructions. These (with the exception of 2) and the 12 brought on board on Saturday, are being sent on the Flagship at 6-0 p.m. to be deported to Sydney. All were allowed an opportunity of getting personal effects together before leaving.\n\nA mail wasdespatched at 4-30 p.m. including despatches by the Brigadier to the Chief of the General Staff.\n\n\n\n\nSUNDAY - 13TH SEPTEMBER '14\n\nNo report received from Commander Beresford of operations of 11th and 12th instant. Reminder sent and report promised to-night.\n\nThe ceremony of breaking and saluting the flag and reading Proclamation was carried out with due ceremony inthe presence of the Admiral and Officers of the Fleet, German and Native population. A temporary flag staff was erected in a cleared space or park in the town close to the wharf, and all available troops and native police were formed up in three sides of a square facingthe flag. The programmecarried out was as followed: -\n\n2-15 p.m. Markers on parade ground.\n2-45 p.m. Parade formed up under Lt.-Col. Watson V.D.\n2-50p.m. Brigadier arrives - General Salute.

Infantry under Lt.-Col. Watsonsent to Herbertshohe by \"Encounter\" to reinforce garrison.\nAttack was made on garrison but not very serious. \n\nAt 5-0 p.m. Cyclist Orderlyreturned with letter from Acting Governor at Baining in reply to Brigadier's letter. As such reply was unsatisfactory and Governor appeared to be merely temporising, Brigadier decided to instruct Col. Watson with 4 Companies Infantry and 2 Machine Guns to march from Herbertshohe at 5-0 a.m. to-morrow to Tomaand effect arrest of Governor. The Admiral concurred in this proposal and Colonel Watson instructed by wireless through \"Encounter\" to act accordingly.\n\nAt 9-0 p.m. Brigadier conferred with Lt.-Col. Paton O.C. Garrison, Capt. Twynam, (Police), Capt. Manning (Judge Advocate), Capt. Ravenscroft (Provost Marshal) as to the work of the day.\n\nBrigadier directed that all German Government Officials in town be arrested early to-morrow morning and sent on board the \"Berrima\" as prisoners. These men are now unemployed and are an element of danger and are suspected of conveying information\n-over-\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n-information-\nto Governor and German Troops who are still in the field.\n\nAll reported quiet in the town. Admiral sent two Officers from fleet to select site for wireless station and erect same.\n\nSATURDAY - 12th September 1914.\n\nThe wireless station was occupied by our troops at 7-30 last night - 19 Germans and 56 Natives being taken prisoners. This station is at Bita-Paka or Bebra, and is 8 miles inlandfrom Kaba Kaul. The masts were destroyed before our arrival, but the entire plantotherwise is intact. It was decided to withdraw all troops from the wireless station and Kaba Kaul, and to transfer them to Herbertshohe and garrison that place as was originally intended. Colonel Watson was ordered to withdraw his troops from Herbertshohe with theexception of two Companies and re-embark on \"Berrima\"; and Commander Beresford was ordered to move to Herbertshohe and relieve troops there. The \"Berrima\" which was off Herbertshohe, proceeded to Rabaul, and 4 Companies Infantry, M.G. Section and 1 Naval Reserves under Lt.Col. Paton garrisoned the town at 6-0 p.m.\n\nNo report has yet been received of yesterday's operations from Commander Beresford. The Intelligence Officer returned to the ship at 7-0 p.m.; he remained theprevious night at the wireless station and reported verbally on the situation there to the Brigadier.\n\nBrigadier wrote letter to the Acting Governor, German New Guinea, demanding surrender and asking him to come in. This letter was sent by Motor Cyclist Orderly under white flag from Herbertshohe to Toma. Orderly was met on the way and was given a letter from another Official saying letter would be delivered to Governor and reply would be ready at Gire Gire at 4-30 p.m. following day.\n\nReceived letter from Admiral enclosing copy of communication sent him previous day by Acting Governor German New Guinea in reply to his demand for surrender of theColony, and also rejoinder from Admiral to Governor for delivery to latter.\n\nLt.-Col. Paton reported occupation of town, seizure of post office and Government Administrative Buildings - posting of outposts and town guards and placing of sentries on residences of German Officials.

In other respects town quiet.\n\n\n\nFRIDAY - 11TH SEPTEMBER 14:\n\nAt 7-15 a.m. the Flagship signalled - \"Stop engines\". We were then in Keravia Bay, an inlet of Blanche Bay.\n\n7-17 a.m. Flagship signalled - \"Send motor boat\", and at 7-17 a.m. further signalled: -\n\"Picket boat will signal to you when the passage into the anchorage has been swept.\"\n\nAt 7-38 a.m. the Brigadier received the following message: -\n\"Captain Fry embarked in the Fantome at Townsville morning 10th September for passage.\"\n\n9-50 a.m. the \"Warrego\" reported that the wireless station was said to be defended by rifles and guns.\n\nThe 50 men who were sent on the 9th instant to the \"Sydney were landed - 25 at Kaba Kaul and 25 at Herbertshohe - with instructions to seize the wireless stations. As they met with strong resistance at Kaba Kaul the Admiral directed that 100 men drawn from the garrison intended for Herbertshohe should reinforce Kaba Kaul party. Two Companies under Commander Elwell and Commander Beresford, also 1 Infy. M.G. Sec. under Capt. Hercus were landed. At about 11-15 a.m. request received fromshore for a Surgeon to be sent to Kaba Kaul to attend a wounded German; at 12-25 a.m. message received that Capt. Pockley, A.M.C., and naval Brigade man had been seriously wounded (N.B. man named Williams); the three wounded were brought to \"Berrima\" in charge of Capt Donaldson, A.M.C. At the same time two German Officers were received as Prisoners - Capt. Wuchert and Lieut. Mayer. At 1-45 p.m. message received from \"Sydney\" that nothing had been heard since early morning of the 25 men landed at Herbertshohe and suggesting that strong force should land there. Instruction immediately issued to Lt.-Col. Watson to land with 4 Coys. Infantry and 2 Machine Guns. At 2-15 p.m. Admiral offered field gun from \"Sydney\" to land with Infantry; this was accepted and sent with Col. Watson's force at 3-0 p.m.\n\nBrigadier visited Admiral and conferred on situation, and recommended that balance of force on \"Berrima\" be landed at Kaba Kaul to reinforce Commander Beresford; that at daylight on the 12 instant guns of fleet should shell with shrapnel ridge between Kaba Kaul and Herbertshohe, which appeared to be strongly held, and that on completion of shelling the forces at Kaba Kaul and Herbertshohe should attack simultaneously. Admiral concurred in Brigadier's dispositions, but directed that \"Berrima\"after landing troops at Kaba Kaul should return to anchorage at Herbertshohe alongside the \"Sydney\". As Captain Stevenson wasof opinion \"Berrima\" could not complete landing and return to Herbertshohe before dark (there being no anchorage at Kaba Kaul) it was determined to defer this until next morning and to utilize time at disposal to land supplies for Herbertshohe Garrison. Instructions were issued to Col. Watson and Commander Beresford as to next morning's work.\n\nIn the afternoon Captain Pockley, A.M.C.,and A.B. Williams succumbed to their wounds on board \"Berrima\" and were buried ashore. Report also received that Commander Elwell, A.Bs Courtney and Moffat had been killed and Lieut. Bowen, RAN, wounded.

The \"Encounter\" had previously gone ahead under the White Flag and sent off a steam cutter with Staff Captain Travers and the Interpreter (Mr. Lyng) with flag of truce to meet the principalOfficial and handhim a letter from the Admiral and also copy of the terms of surrender by Governor of German New Guinea. Captain Travers returned with 3 German Residents who gave an assurance that the place was not mined and was undefended. The channel was swept for mines. The 3 German residents, together with Administrator, visited the Flagship and had an interview with the Admiral when the original agreement was explained to them.\n\nAt 11-0 am the \"Encounter\" and the \"Berrima\" entered Wilhelmshafen. As soon as the \"Berrima\" had dropped anchor the Administrator and Staff went on shore and removed the German Imperial Flag which was flying on the Administration Buildings, and hoisted the Union Jack in its place. In the meantime the Garrison Troops, consisting of 1½Coys, Infantry and ½Coy. Naval Reserves under command of Major Martin, also a detachment of the A.M.C. under Captain Byrne, were landed and guards posted. All German residents were taken prisoner numbering 4 Officials and 13 others. All took the oath of neutrality.

Two months rationsand other stores for the garrison were landed and the \"Berrima\" and \"Encounter\" left the Harbour at 5-15 p.m. \n\nAt 3-30 p.m. the Administrator sent the following signal to the Admiral:-\n\n\"Garrison posted, all in suitable quarters. Flag hoisted, Proclamation read. 17 Germans surrendered; 4 of these are Officials who will probably be employed. theothers are Planters, Missionaries and business men, all of whom have taken oath of neutrality. Chief Official not yet in but has been sent for.\"\n\nThe Admiral replied \"Congratulate you on rapidity and satisfactory result.\"\n\nAt 7-0 p.m. ther Administrator sent the following message to the Minister for Defence:-\n\n\"Troops under my command occupied Kaiser Wilhelmsland today without opposition. Flag hoisted, Proclamation issued; principal Official absent; 4 officials and 13 other Germans surrendered; all subscribed oath of neutrality. The Officials will be temporarily engaged assist administration; others are Planters, Missionaries, Business Men; 40 fighting men left Wilhelmshafen fortnight ago reinforce German Troops New Britainbut arrived after capitulation - now prisoners at Rabaul. Found private stores well stocked. Health of troops excellent. returning Rabaul - \"Holmes\"\n\nAt 8-40 a.m. the following signal was received from the Admiral:-\n\n\"I cannot guarantee anyfacilities for deporting prisoners from the Islands.\"\n\nThis message has evidently been sent Administrator because the latter could not see his wayyesterday to fall inwith the Admiral's views as to modifying at Friedrich Wilhelmshafen the provision in the agreement of capitulation as to placing no obstacle in the way of Officials returning to\n-Germany-\n\n(2)\n\nGermany, which provision was questioned by Australian Government. However, as the whole of the German residents at Friedrich Wilhelmshafen surrendered and took the oath of neutrality, and the 4 Officials will be engaged, the Admiral's message did not affect the position in any way as none of the Officials required to be deported.\n\nThe Administrator still sees no reason forthinking the provision referred to was an unwise one, and it forms part of a colemn compact and cannot be altered or varied in anyway.\n\nP.M.O. reports the health of the troops on board excellent. Fro 12 midnight to the time of arrival at Wilhelmshafen the ship has sailed 98 nautical miles, making a grand total of 525 miles since leaving Rabaul. On the return journey from Friedrich Wilhelmshafen the ship sailed 72 nautical miles up to 12 midnight.\n\nWEDNESDAY - 23RD SEPTEMBER 1914.\n\nAt 9-15 a.m. Administrator received a signal from Vice-Admiral intimating that at 9-30 a.m. the ships of theSquadron would stop engines and request Administrator to come on board flagship in reference to an important message received by the Admiral the previous evening.\n\nWhen the ships stopped the flagship sent a boat for the Administrator, who left the \"Berrima\" about 9-45 a.m.\n\nThe Admiral handed the Administrator a telegram from the Minister for Defence, which ran as follows:-\n\n\"From Minister for Defence to Vice-Admiral Commanding:\n\"Pleaseinform Administrator with regard to his telegram to Chief of General Staff 20th Septr:\nIt does not appear from telegram whether terms set out are merely proposals or whether they are terms on which surrender has actually been accepted. Commonwealth Government considers terms as stated unduly advantageous to the enemy. Governor should be held as prisoner of war and should not under any circumstances be allowed to return to Germany. Civil Officials whose services are not required or who refuse to take oath of neutrality not allowed to return to Germany. Sufficient reasons for allowing surrender with military honors do not appear. Payment of salaries of deported Civil Officers and travelling expenses of families to Europe appear unjustifiable. if terms mentioned are those which Governor and his force has agreed to surrenderand have actually surrendered different conditions arise. So far as conditions granted relate to surrender of forces and are conditions which Brigadier has authority to grant they must be scrupulously observed. Government, however, not aware that Brigadier had authority to promise that any of the enemy's forces or Civil Officers should be allowed to returned to Germany, in whichcase conditions are void and may be disregarded. Brigadier had no authority to pledge Commonwealth Naval Board Revenue for salaries of Civil Officers and expenses of their families.\"\n\nThe matter was then discussed between the Admiral and the Administrator. The Admiral showed the Administrator a telegram he proposed to send to the Minister through the Naval Board, pointing out that he did not give the Administrator authority to make the terms he did. The Admiral also suggested that in view of the objection of the Government to the terms and conditions as arranged, when the Administrator reached Friedrich Wilhelmshafen next day that it be explained that as the Government did not agree with the proposal toallow Officials to return to Germany, this portion of the agreement would be cut out as far asFriedrich Wilhelmshafen Officials were concerned. The Administrator said he could not agree to this as the agreement in question was solemnly entered into and subscribed to by both sides and applied to the whole of the possessions formerly administered by the Governorof German New Guinea, and to make this alteration now would be making fish of one and flesh of another; he could not, therefore, consent to any alteration in the terms and conditions of the treaty of capitulation. He admitted that the Admiral had given him no authority to make the terms he did, and stated that he did so in the best interests of the Empire and was quite prepared to accept full responsibility for his actions. The Administrator pointed out that as a matter of fact he had received no instructions from Head Quarters how he was to\n-act-\n\n\n(2)\n\n-act-\nin case of surrender, but the occasion arose and he had to meet it and he did so in what he considered the best way and was quite prepared to stand by it, and would do the same again to-morrow.\n\nThe following reply to the Minister's telegram was then prepared by the Administrator and the Admiral promised to despatch same:-\n\n\"The terms mentioned are those of actual surrender and have been signed. The Governor and Officials are Civilians; all are to be sent to Australia; no guarantee that facilities will be afforded for return to Germany. Payments under agreement are from fund of German New Guinea in my possession and are to be refunded out of German Colonial Subsidy. Have not pledged Commonwealth revenue. Immediate action was necessary, and, having in mind the future of the Colony under Britishrule I adopted terms considered to be most advantageous to the Empire, using my judgment from the conditions I found prevailing on thespot. Arrangements made already provising very satisfactory.\"\n\nAdministrator\n23\/9\/1914.\n\nThe Administrator returned to the \"Berrima\" at about 10-45 a.m. and the voyage was resumed.\n\nP.M.O. reports the health of the troops on board excellent.\n\nAt midnight the ship had sailed 259 nautical miles, making a total of 427 miles from Rabaul.\n\nTUESDAY - 22ND SEPTEMBER 1914;\n\naT 7-0 A.M.

Col. Paton, representing the Brigadier. Lt.-Col. Paton was instructed to inform the Governor there would be no objection to his remaining at Herbertshohe until the return of the \"Berrima\" fromFriedrich Wilhelmshafen.\n\nAt 9-33 a.m. a message was received from V.A.C. stating it would be much better if a German Officer were placed on board the \"Encounter\" so that he might accompany Captain Travers on shore with flag of truce. A reply was sent that the German Officer declined to so act and an Interpreter had been sent in lieu.\n\nAbout 9-45 a.m. the ships moved in single line ahead inn the following order:-\n\"Australia\"\n\"Montcalm\" (French)\n\"Berrima\"\n\"Encounter\"\nat a sped of 12 knots an hour.\n\nThe two German Prisoners (Capt.

Since that date, however, despatches containing full particulars have been received by ordinary mail in Australia which, together with the facts I have herein stated, will place matters in their correct light and cause honor and credit to be rendered where due.\n\n\n\n5\n\nG.R.\nPROCLAMATION\n\nProclamation on behalf of His Majesty George the Fifth, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the Dominions Overseas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.\nBy Colonel WILLIAM HOLMES, D.S.O.,V.D., Brigadier Commanding His Majesty's Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force.\nWHEREASthe Forces under my command have occupied the Island of New Britain;\nANDWHEREASupon such occupation the Authority of German Government, has ceased to exist therein.\nANDWHEREASit has become essential to provide for proper Government of the said Colony, and for the protection of the lives and property of the peaceful Inhabitants thereof.\nNow, I, WILLIAM HOLMES, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, Colonel in His Majesty's Forces, Brigadier Commanding the aforesaid Expeditionary Force, do hereby declare and proclaim as follows:-","35":" From and after the date of these presents, the Island of New Britain and its Dependencies areheld by me in Military Occupation in the name of His Majesty the King.","36":" War will be waged only against the armed Forces of the German Empire and its Allies in the present War.","37":" The lives and private property of peaceful Inhabitants will be protected, and the laws and customs of the Colony will remain in force so far as it is consistent with the Military situation.","38":" It the needs of the Troops demand it, private property may be requisitioned. Such property will be paid for at its fair value.","39":" Certain Officials of the late Government may be retained, if they so desire, at their usual salaries.\n(6) In return for such protection, it is the duty of all Inhabitants to behave in an absolutely peaceful manner, to carry on their ordinary pursuits so far as is possible, to take no part directly or indirectly in any hostilities, to abstain from communication with His Majesty's Enemies, and to render obedience to such orders as may be promulgated.\n(7) All male Inhabitants of European origin are required to take the oath of neutrality prescribed, at the Garrison Head Quarters; and all firearms, ammunition, and war material in the possession or control of Inhabitants are to be surrendered forthwith, as is also all public property of the late Government.\n(8) Non-compliance with the terms of this Proclamation, and disobedience of such orders as from time to time may be promulgated, will be dealt with according to Military Law.\n(9) It is hereby notified that this Proclamation takes effect in the whole Island of New Britain and its Dependencies from this date.\n\nGiven at Government House, RABAUL, this twelfth day of September, 1914.\n\nWILLIAM HOLMES.\nBrigadier Commanding.\n\nWitness:\nFRANCIS HERITAGE.\nBrigade Major\n\nGOD SAVE THE KING.\n\nWireless telegraphy.\nThe capture of the Wireless Telegraphy station at Bitapaka put out of action the last of the four stations forming the German Pacific chain. These stations were situated at Yap, Bitapaka, Naru, Samoa.\nYap was destroyed by H.M.A,S. Hampshire, Naru was put out of action by a landing party from H.M.A.S. Melbourne, Samoa was put out of action by the Germans, on thelanding of the New ZealandExpedition at Apia. The importance of these stations for the defence of theGerman possessions in the Pacific was of no little value, and from a Government and commercial aspect a convenience, but not to the extent as to justify their existence. The Bitapaka station was, on the outbreak of the war, in the early stages of construction and up to the time of its capture had been working on low power only. Thereappears to be little doubt that military considerations were the primary object of these stations, but the establishment of a chainof High PowerStations without sufficient military protection has proved, in the Pacific, a failure. It might be regretted that sufficient time had not been given to our friends the enemy to provide a garrison at all these stations. Great credit is reflected by the enterprising spirit exhibited in their establishment.\n\n6\nGovernment Gazette.\nRabaul, 15th October, 1914.\n\nThe Military Government of New Britain.\n\nADMINISTRATION ORDER No.1.\nBy Colonel W.

MIROW AND TAIFERT:\n\nOn Saturday, 17th October, the Administrator had an interviews with Messrs. Mirow and Taifert, who acted as a Deputation from thevarious German Merchant Firms in Rabaul, in regard to the distribution of supplies provided they purchased the same from Mr. Lucas, representingBurns, Philp Coy. Ltd. They pointed out that Mr. Lucas had informed them that certain quantities of goods had arrived by the S.S. \"Moresby\", which he was prepared to dispose of to them on certain terms and conditions. The prices at which the goods were offered by Mr. Lucas were fairlyreasonable, and they did not anticipate any difficulty in regard to definite arrangements being made in payment for same, but it was useless for them to purchase thesegoods unless they had facilities for forwarding the same to their various stations in the different Islands.\n\nThe Administrator pointed out that the goods in question had been shipped from Australia by the \"Moresby\" at his instance, on representations made some time ago by the Merchants themselves, who stated that they were getting short of supplies and had asked the Administratorto help them in obtaining supplies from Australia, which they undertook to purchase on arrival.\n\nThe Administrator intimated that he was anxious that normal conditions of trade should be established at the earliest possible moment. He realised that as the outlying stations were in need of stores, andas the administration had been taken over by the British, it was incumbent uponhim to do all in his power to assist the Merchants in distributing their goods. He, therefore, gave the deputation his assurance everything would be done to facilitate this distribution by the Merchants. All that would be necessary was, when the Merchants wished to forward supplies to their stations, to make application to the Administrator stating when they desired their vessel to leave, where they were going to, and when they would return. He would then direct the King's Harbour Master to issue the necessary permit topass them out of port. This course was necessary, as it was desirable for obvious reasons that traffic of this kind must be kept under control. With this assurance, therefore, they would be perfectly safe in negotiating with Burns, Philp and Coy's Representative, for the purchase of the supplies which they needed.\n\nThe Deputation stated that the Motor Boats at present in the Harbour at Rabaul would not be of sufficient capacity to convey goods to theStations, and asked that they might be permitted to call in various vessels belonging to them at different places, to assist in the distribution.\n\nMr. Taifert, Manager of theNew Guinea Company, was very anxious to know whether he could send word for the Steamer \"Siar\" to come to Rabaul. The Administrator informed him that this was a question he could not answer at present, as he understood that the \"Siar\"\" had just had justrecently come from Macassar loaded with rice and other supplies, a portion of which had been surreptitiously landed at Vuna Paka on the North Coast at one of New Guinea Coy's Stations. Seeing that no authority had been given for thissupply of goods to be landed there, and no duty had been paid on the same, he (the Administrator) had come to the conclusion that the goods in question had been smuggled into the Colony, and had, therefore, given instructions to the Provost Marshal to impound all that had been landed, and this had already been done.\n\n(2)\n\nIn reply to the Administrator, Mr. Taifert admitted that the \"Siar\" was in hiding somewhere in the vicinity of Kaiwieng, and was practically acting as a distributing centre from which the goods referred to as having been landed at Vuna Paka had been sent by the Motor Boat \"Sente\". He, however, stated that the goods in question had not been smuggled as he had declared the cargo at the first port of call viz., Eitape in Kaiser Wilhelmsland; he admitted that no duty had been paid, and that according to German laws it was not necessary that such duty should be paid until 30 days after declaration. This had been the practice in the past, and his Company had a running account with the Government of the Colony.\n\nThe Administrator stated that he was not prepared then to deal with individual cases of the kind; he could not give any reply in regard to the \"Siar\" for 3 or 4 days, but he repeated the assurance he had already given that facilities would be offered by him for the distribution of any supplies which might be purchased fromBurns, Philp & Coy's Agent.\n\nThe Deputation did not seem to regard this as sufficient, and it seemed to the Administrator an attempt to force his hands to release or give permission for the \"Siar\" to come to Rabaul was being made, which, however, he declined to do.\n\nOn Monday, 19th October, the Administrator had an interview with the Provost Marshal, when the latter informed him of all the circumstances connected with the surreptitious landing of goods at Vuna Paka, and pointed out that Mr. Taifert had made several statements which he afterwards admitted were incorrect, and that Mr. Taifert stated that he had made these incorrect statements in order to gain time for his boat to get away.\n\nImmediately afterwards the Administrator had another interview with Mr. Taifert and his Assistant (Mr. Kuhn). The Administrator referred to the mis-statements which had been made by Mr. Taifert in regard to the \"Siar's\"cargo, and stated that in view of this fact he could not accept Mr. Taifert's assurance in the absence of documentary evidence, that he declared in Eitape, and he (the Administrator) intended to regard the goods put ashore at Vuna Paka as smuggled and impound the same. He also told Mr. Taifert he proposed to put on as a temporary measure a larger Steamer on the New Ireland trade, so that if Burns, Philp & Coy. should arrange to run a monthly service to Rabaul, this Steamer would be able to distribute any goods purchased by the Merchants at the various places, and at the same time collect Copra from the outlying stations and bring it to the central depot at Rabaul, for conveyance to Australia or elsewhere. He asked Mr. Taifert to convey this information to the other Merchants, and assure them that they would be perfectly safe in making arrangements to purchase goods from Burns, Philp & Coy's Representative.\n\nOther matters referred to at the interview were the Note issue, which the Administrator had decided upon, and Mr.Taifert was informed that these notes were to be regarded as legal tender during the Military occupation, redeemable at the termination of such occupation. Mr. Taifert alluded to certain claims which he deemed himself to have against the late Government of New Guinea, and was advised by the Administrator to put such claims in writing so that they might be investigated by Captain Fry, Treasured. Mr. Tailfert also stated that certain monies had been seized at the Offices of his Company at Rabaul and Herbertshohe. These monies, he stated, were not Government monies, but the property of the Company and he asked that same be refunded. The Administrator pointed out that considerable difficulty had been experienced in getting any information from the Company as to the transactions of thelate Governor, and unless the Company could prove that the monies in question were not Government monies, he would not be prepared to refund same. However, this would be a matter for further investigation.\n\n(3)\n\nAt 4-30 p.m. Mr. Lucas, Representative, Burns, Philp & Coy. called at Government House and stated that the whole of the Merchants led by Mr. Taifert - who seemed to act as their Spokesman - had declined to agree to support a monthly service if put on by Burns, Philp and Coy. and also refused to purchase any of the goods which had been brought up by the S.S. \"Moresby\". \n\nAt 9-0 a.m. on the 20th instant, the Administrator sent for Mr. Taifert, and informed him that he had given consideration to his case and had decided to arrest him and senthim aboard a ship in the harbour with a view to his being deported from the Colony, and the grounds that he regarded him as a disturbing element and altogether an undesirable man to retain at Rabaul.\n\nMr. Taifert pointed out that he had already taken the oath of neutrality; the Administrator replied that he was aware of this, and he also knew that such oath had since been broken as Mr. Taifert had lied to him in connection with the landing of the goods at Vuna Paka, and having found his word was unreliable he could not accept his statement that he had pass entries for the goodsbrought by the \"Siar\" from Macassar, unless documentary evidence were produced. Itwas not, however, all together on account of his actions with respect to the \"Siar\" that he (the Administrator) was now taking this action. It was principally because, as previously stated, he regard him as a disturbing element and undesirable to retain in the Colony.\n\nMr. Taifert was then handed over to the custody of theProvost Marshal, who was instructed not to allow him to have communication with anyone on shore, but to place him on board the \"Meklong\" under guard until such time as a vessel can be arranged for him to leave the Colony.\n\nMONDAY - 19TH OCTOBER 1914:\n\nThe Administrator interviewed the Manager of the New Guinea Coy. and informed him that the \"Moresby\", at the request of the Rabaul Merchants, had brought supplies, and it now rests with the Merchants to accept these supplies as every facility will be afforded for the disposal of same to outlying stations.\n\nReport of the Board of Enquiry into the accident resulting in the death of Pte. Wates has been received and a finding of \"accidental death\" was returned.\n\nThe Enquiry into the explosionon the 7th instant, resulting in Ptes. James and Guard sustaining severe injuries, has been postponed until such time as the two injured men are able to give evidence.\n\nReport of O.C. Troops regarding looting by Troops at Mioka is also being held in abeyance owing to absence in the \"Nusa\" of certain Troops who are implicated.\n\nReport in respect to Enquiry held into robbing of the R.C. Fathers at Malakoona has been received, but the Administrator has returned the papers to O.C. Troops in order that a Court Martial may be held to deal with the accused.\n\nAt 4-0 p.m. Mr. Lucas called on the Administrator at Government House, and reported that the whole of theMerchants, led by the General Manager of theNew Guinea Coy., (Mr. Taifert), had declined to support a monthly service offered by Burns, Philp & Coy., and had refused to purchase any of the goods which had been brought from Sydney by the \"Moresby\". The Provost Marshal verbally reported to the Administrator the circumstances connected with the surreptitious landing of goods at Vuna Paka on the North Coast from the \"Siar\".\n\nThe Administrator ordered the following message to be despatched to the Minister for Defence: -\n\"Merchants here decline \"Moresby's\" cargo; delay departure of \"Matunga\" until further advised. \"Moresby departs Suva Wednesday.\"\n\nThe following message was received from Port Moresby: -\n\"Telegram received from you 17th instant in 5 letter groups. Cannot decipher. For whom is it intended and what code are you using. etc.\"\n\nThis refers to message despatched in Sliding Alphabet Code, thanking Military Authorities at Suva for their congratulations on the capture of the \"Komet\".\n\nEngineer-Lieut. Creswell, F.W.T.O, requested by wireless permission to hand over to the Administrator copy of Emergency Vocabulary and Long Distance Code.\n\nNo news received from Major Heritage on board the \"Nusa.\"\n\nHealth of troops at Rabaul and Herbertshohe satisfactory.\n\n \nDIARY OF EVENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE AUSTRALIAN\n . \nNAVAL AND MILITARY EXPEDITION UNDER THE COMMAND\n . \nOF COLONEL WIL LIAM HOLMES, D.S.O., V.D.\n\n \nFORTNIGHT ENDED 15THNOVEMBER 1914\n:\n (2-11-14 to 15-11-14).\n\n \n \n\n\n\nSUNDAY - 15TH NOVEMBER 14: \n\nLieut.

Owing to shipping difficulties it was learned that the \"Messina\" would not be able to leave until the 5th instant.

So it is very necessary for every man to learn the simple art of keepinh heath. I say simple, because if we only follow certain plain rules and take a few precautions, we can all guard against those milder forms of disease, and even the serious disease which so quickly cripple a fighting force, and turn it from an efficient fighting machine into an invalid's home. Therefore, it is important to learn, and more important still to practice the simple art of healthy living. If we own a valuable horse or a good dog we take great care to keep it clean, see it gets good food regularly, and given in a proper manner, and that its living quarters are clean and sanitary. But, unfortunately, many men who will cheerfully and willingly do this, neglect the most obvious of their own and their comrades health.\n\nIn this article I propose to point out some of the simplest and most important facts in connection with this subject, so that you may help yourselves to keep healthy. It should be the pride of a soldier to do everything in his power to avoid being sick in hospital, his ambition should be to beat duty in the ranks. Your officers will help you, the Army Medical Corps will help you, but the greatest part lies with yourselves, Therefore make your motto always \"KEEP FIT.\"\n\nIf I were asked to name the one thing above all others which men should remember if they are going to \"keep fit\" and be healthy, I should unhesitatingly say \"Cleanliness,\" This applies not only to men as individuals, but also to men as a body. Working as we are as a force, the importance of cleanliness cannot be exaggerated, for the carelessness of one man may cause the ill health of a dozen innocent comrades who are doing all in their power to keep fit. Unfortunately the culprit not infrequently escapes the results of his regard, and so every man should see that those around him are doing their duty to him as well as to themselves.\n\nWhen we speak of cleanliness, we infer the presence of dirt which has to be removed. Now what is dirt? Dirt is simply matter which is in the wrong place. Sand in the street is clean, but if it gets into the works of a machine it is dirt and must be removed. The most dangerous form of dirt from our point of view is the refuse and waste that accumulates about men and their dwellings, for this is the main cause of preventable disease; for nearly every disease that cripples an army is preventable, and yet very many more men are put out of action on service by disease than by\n\nwounds. In the South African War, five men died of disease to every one killed in action, and 20 were admitted to hospital for illness to every one for wounds. The Japanese recognised this and in the Russo-Japanese War they reduced these figures enormously by training their men to look after themselves. You can do the same by intelligent application of ordinary rules of hygiene.\n\nNow we must consider the question of cleanliness and how to obtain it and preserve it, for that is the task we must all set ourselves if we are going to remain an efficient fighting force. Let every man make it a personal matter, and then the whole force is directly concerned. Personal cleanliness then is he first thing to be sought. This must be considered under the headings of (1) The Skin (2) The Clothing (3) The teeth (4 ) Food and feeding (5) Quarters.\n\nTHE SKIN forms a covering for pretection, but it is a most important organ for getting rid of impurities which have been cast out of the body or soak into and dry in the clothing, it becomes irritating and unhealthy, besides being offensive. So you see the necessity for the daily swim when it can be obtained. For if the skin is dirty it can't do its work, if the pores are clogged with sweat, the impurities that should get out are locked in, and the health must suffer. But if the swim or bath is unobainable every man should make an effort to wash those parts of the body where sweat and dirt are especially liable to collect. These should be washed every day if possible.\n\n(a) Between the legs and buttocks.\n\n(b) The feet and toes.\n\n(c) The arm pits.\n\nThis can be done with a little water, in a spare quarter of an hour. Use a small piece of rough cloth or towelling as a rubber. Don't use too much soap, and wash it all off before drying. The daily bath is very necessary in the tropics, but if unobtainable do not neglect these simple precautions. The rubbing that accompanies washing and bathing helps to keep the skin active and healthy.\n\nThe hands should always be washed before eating whenever possible, for germs and dirt may be conveyed to the food and to the mouth by this means. The nails should also be kept cut short and clean.\n\nThe hair should be kept closely cut, especially in this climate, and the head frequently washed.\n\nTHE CLOTHING: As it is so necessary to kepp the skin clean and active it is equally necessary to keep the clothing in contact with it clean. Hence the reason for frequent change and washing of under-clothing. Do not wear the same shirt night and day: keep a spare one and change them. If possible keep extra ones clean and change them frequently. Socks require careful attention, for if neglected the feet become soft and unfit for marching. A dirty foot is an unsound foot. Change socks frequently and keep them clean and washed.\n\nTHE TEETH need careful attention for all solid food has to be ground up by them. Use the tooth brush daily, using boiled water for this purpose.\n\nFOOD AND FEEDING: This is a most important question, for much of the sickness on service comes through neglect in this quarter. Every man is personally concerned in this and should see that those who handle his food do so properly. The hands and clothes of all persons who handle food or cooking utensils should be clean. The bread and meat stores should be kept clean and tidy, well ventilated and free from flies. Mess tables, eating utensils, knives, forks and spoons should be thoroughtly clean. The latter should be washed in boiled water only, and dried on clean towles. Chew your food thoroughly, and do not swallow it in lumps.\n\nQUARTERS: This includes mess rooms, sleeping quarters, surroundings, latrines, refuse pits, etc. Rules are laid down for the care of these, and all men should make it their business to see that they are carried out, not only because they are orders, but also because neglect of these will surely bring sickness amongst you, and, as I have said, it is usually the innocent ones who suffer.\n\nRemember that on active service the chief danger to you is not from the enemy, but from disease bred in one's own camp. The most serious disease arising from sanitary neglect are typhoid, (enteric) fever and dysentery: and these spread from infected water, and from dirty and neglected latrines. Look to these things and bear in mind the great importance of cleaniness. If every man does this, the Australian Naval and Military Expedition will establish a record for health and sanitation, and by proud of the great number of men who alsways \"KEEP FIT\".\n\nGovernment Gazette.\n\nLiterary contributions for publication in future issues of the Government Gazette are invited from members of the Expeditionary Force, to be addressed to The Editor, Government Gazette, ADministration Headquarters, Rabaal.\n\n3\nGovernment Gazette.\nRABAUL, 1st NOVEMBER, 1914\nThe Military Government of New Britain\n\nADMINISTRATION ORDERS.\nBy Colonel W.

In addition, my instructions were to search for and capture the steamer \"Siar,\" which had been engaged in smuggling cargo into New Britain, etc.\n\nThe Expedition reached Kawieang on the afternoon of Saturday, 17th instant; the flag was hoisted and saluted, the Proclamation published and steps taken to release Mr. Jolley, and get the German Commissioner in.\n\nI could obtain but little information regarding the \"Siar,\" but had the impression confirmed that she was in hiding at Garden Island, some 70 miles south-east of Kawieang. Accordingly I put to sea, at 9 o'clock the same night, leaving Lieutenant Basil Holmes with 10 men for a Garrison at Kawieang, and steamed for Garden Island. This place was reached in a thick haze about 11 o'clock Sunday morning, 18th instant. From a knowledge of Island customs I anticipated that if in harbour, the officers of vessel would be breakfasting at the Trading Station. This surmise proved to be correct, as on coming abreast of the Station, white men were noticed hurrying from the verandah. Proceeding at full speed, the \"Nusa\" was headed for the little harbour of Tekeriki, where the steamer \"Siar,\" the large motor schooner \"Senta\" were found anchored. Before the officers could reach their ships, prize crews were placed on board and all the arms seized and ships papers taken into custody. P.O. Clark was put in charge of the \"Siar,\" together with A.B. Courtman as Engineer; the engines of this vessel were found to have been temporarily dismantled. As daylight on Monday, 19th Instant, the \"Nusa,\" towing the \"Siar,\" and motor schooners under their own power weighed anchor for Kawieang, reaching that place the following morning at 8 o'clock, where the \"Siar's\" engines were placed in working order, and fuel taken on board. Mr Jolley had in the meantime been released, and the German Commissioner came in at noon and surrendered himself, at the same time formally handing over New Ireland to the British Government.\n\nI arranged for Lieutenant Basil Holmes to remain at Kawieang in temporary charge of the Administration, with a detail of six soldiers, it being understood that a permanent garrison would be dispatched within a week from Rabaul.\n\nOn Wednesday, 21st instant, the Fotilla put to sea, \"Siar\" being under her own steam, the German Commissioner, also the German Treasurer and one reservist as prisoners of war on board, and Mr Jolley as a passenger. It was found necessary for the \"Nusa\" to tow the motor schooner \"Matupi\"; \"Senta\" under her own power.\n\nThe expedition came to anchorage at Rabaul early Friday morning, 23rd inst.\n\nThe services rendered by Captain Strasburg were very valuable, and it was his local knowledge which enabled the captured ships to be found so quickly, I would further desire to bring under your excellency's notice the good work done by P.O. Clark, placed in charge of the \"Siar,\" and A.B. Courtman, in charge of the engine room of that ship.\n\nIt is submitted that the captured ships are legal prizes.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n(Sgd.) FRANCIS HERITAGE; Major.\n\nRatavul Pass\nThe tunnel through the hill at Ratavul on the road from Rabaul to Tallili Bay, which was blocked owing to large quantities of material having fallen from the roof after the fire which destroyed the timber lining, has been cleared, debris removed, and traffic restored. It is not proposed at present to replace the lining either with timber or concrete, but steps will be taken to remove all material as it falls and thus keep the road available for wheeled traffic. The question of dealing with this spot in a permanent way will be considered later.\n\nCinematograph Theatre.\nAn enterprising New Zealander, Mr. W. R. Lauri, opened a cinematograph theatre in Rabaul about two months ago. Owing to the War operations is was, however, closed. On Sunday 25th the theatre re-opened and henceforth two performanances per week will be given, one on Wednesday evening for the troops, and one on Sunday afternoon for the general public. The admittance for military persons is 1s. For the general public it is decided by color:- whites pay 2s., yellow (including Japs, Chinese and Malays) 1s., and brown (that is natives) 6d.\n\nLOCAL NEWS.\n\nBritish Vice-Consul.\nIt is a matter for congratulation that the British Vice-Consul (Mr. Jolley) has been restored to his home at Rabaul. At the outbreak of the war Mr. Jolley refused to give his parole, and was therefore arrested and secretly removed to another part of the possessions. The sympathy of all has been with him and his family.\n\nThe expedition dispatched to Kawieang on the 16th October, effected his release and Mr. Jolley returned to Rabaul on the 23rd October. It is hoped that he is little or more the worse for his experience.\n\nThe Garrison Bakery.\nA garrison bakery has recently been opened in connection with the store in Rabaul, and the troops are now supplied with fresh bread daily. This is a new proof of the comfort and welfare of the troops being continually studied. The bakery was designed and erected by Lance-Corporal W.T. Field of \"A\" Company, and is in charge of Sergeant C.W. Taylor, ably assisted by Privates J. Corroy, J. Szablowski, and J. Read, all of \"C\" Company. Baking goes on continually and 1,000lb of bread is produced daily.\n\nShipping.\nThe permanent Garrison for New Ireland, under command of Captain Grant Thorold, was dispatched by the S.S. Meklong on the 28th instant, and, on the same date the S.S. Messina conveyed the troops to occupy Naura. The Administrator and Staff Captain accompanied this Expedition.\nDuring His Excellency's absence Major F.B. Heritage will act as Deputy Administrator.\n\nTrade.\nIt is anticipated that normal conditions of trade will shortly be established.\nMessrs. Burns, Philp & Co,'s steamers, \"Moresby\" and \"Matunga\" have already arrived at Rabaul with Government stores and merchants' supplies. The \"Meklong\" has been utilised for inter-island commerce with New Britain by the Government and the \"Matunga\" has made her first trip to FredericWilhelmshafen carrying passengers and supplies.\nThese ships are bringing back large cargoes of copra which will be dispatched to Sydney by the Burns, Philp vessels.\n\nRight and Left Halves at Soccer.\nRepresentative teams from the Right and Left Halves of the Battalion met on Saturday afternoon (24th October). The match resulted in an easy victory for the Left Half, the score were:- Left Half 4; Right Half 1.\n\nCapture of the \"Samoa.\"\nOn 24th inst. the \"Madang\" which was commissioned by the Administrator, and put in charge of Lieut-Commander R.S. Lambton V.D.,R.A.N.R., left Rabaul in search of the \"Samoa\" Steaming along the western coast of New Ireland for about 50 miles the \"Samoa\" was discovered on the morning of the 25th in Kalibi Bay. On firing a shot the German flag was hoisted. The \"Samoa\" surrendered without resistance, a prize crew was put on board and she arrived under own power in Rabaul later on in the day. The captain, being ashore at the time, escaped. The captured ship is a three masted schooner 260 tons, with a 110h.p. Standard motor engine, and was owned by \"Deutsche Handels and Pflanzung Gesellschaft.\"\n\nThe Weather.\nThe spell of dry weather continues and water-carting for domestic purposes has been resorted to.\n\nPOST OFFICE NOTICES.\nMail closes for Sydney 7th November, 1914.\nStamps are now available, and may be obtained at the Post Office.\nPostage to Australia and British Possessions: Troops, 1d; Others, 2½d.\nPostage to adjacent Island,1d.\nThe troops' attention is drawn to clause 3 of the Garrison Orders,","55":" dealing with mail matters.\nMail left for Wilhelmshafen on the 30.10.14. per Matunga.

Therefore","57":" was practically a holiday and all who were freefrom duty attended at the sports ground. The participants in the events were members of the Expeditionary Force at present situated in Rabaul. A large entry was received for each item on the programme and every event was most evenly contested. The concluding item was an attractive one - beiing a Rugby football matchbetween representative teams from the Right and Left Halves of the Battalion. The following are the results of the day's sports :-\nSquad Drill and Rifle Exercises (teams of 25 men and a Sergeant from each Company; \"F: Company (18 points). 1; \"H\" Company (17 points). 2. Teams from \"A\", \"C\", \"D:. and \"G.\" Companies also competed. \nTug-of-War: \"B\": Company. 1; \"D\" Company. 2. Teams from \"A\", \"F\", \"G\" and \"H\" Companies and Naval Reserves also competed.\nRelay Race (teams of 8 men fromeach Company, each torun 100 yards): \"H\" Company, 1. Teams from \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"F\" and \"G\" Companies also competed.\nOne Hundred Yards Championship: Private O'Donnell, \"C\" Company, 1: Private Davey, D\" Company, 2.

Great excitement was manifested in connection with this event, and from start to finish the ardour of either side's supporters never wavered. The match was very evenly contested and resulted in a draw, each side scoring a try. The first score was by the Left Half, when Private Redmond forced his way across the line. Sergeant Crombie missed the kick at goal. This was the only score in the first half. In the second spell the Right Half had matters much their own way,but their efforts lacked the finishing touch. The Left Half managed to keep their line clear until towards the end of the game when Private Hawkes was successful in securing a try. Private Mulford missed the kick at goal. The closing stages were most exciting, for both sides were attacking strongly in turn. The Left Half lasted a little better than their opponents. When full time arrived the play was right on the Right Half's line. It is difficult to single out any player as outstanding but Lieut. Kirke and Private Hawkes in the forwards and Private Chalenor and Private Driscoll in the backs of the Right Half showed good form. For the Left Half, Lieut. Sampson, Private Watson and Private Ballerum, in the forwards, and Lieut. Sherbon and Private Cooper in the backs, were always prominent. Lieut. Sadler proved an efficient referee.\n\nBy Authoroty - Lieut. J.

Messina,\" with a force consisting of two officers (Captain Norrie and Lieutenant Fisher), fifty rank and file, a machine gun, and a detachment of the Army Medical Corps, under Captain Donaldson, to take possession of and occupy the Island of Nauru.\nThe ship's course was first shaped to the British possession, Ocean Island, which is distant only 160 miles from Nauru. These two islands have very valuable deposits of phosphate, which are being extensively developed by a British company, known as the Pacific Phosphates Company.\nThe \"Messina\" arrived at Ocean Island on the 3rd November, when is was learned that all the British employees of the Pacific Phosphates Company, about 40 in number, employed at Nauru, had been deported by the Germans to Ocean Island on the 6th September.\n\nThe Administrator decided, after conferring with the British Resident Commissioner (Mr. E.C. Eliot) and the manager of the company, to take all the deported officials back on the \"Messina\" to Nauru.\nThe ship left Ocean Island on the 5th November, a guard of honor of four officials and 40 others for the Administrator being formed by the Resident Commissioner, consisting of British Volunteer Reserves, Japanese soldiers, and Native police.\nNauru was reached at daylight, and after signalling Government House, Captain Travers, after landing under a flag of truce, brought the Resident Commissioner on board the \"Messina,\" who gave his assurance to the Administrator that no resistance would be offered. The troops were then landed and all Germans arrested, the British flag taking the place of the German flag on the Government House flagstaff. The passengers from Ocean Island, together with their belongings, stores and rations for the troops were then landed.\n\nOn the 7th inst. the Administrator held a leveeof the Native Chiefs on the Island, 14 in number.\nIn the afternoon Captain Norrie officially hoisted the British flag; all available troops, together with the Native Police, were paraded, a large attendance of white people and natives being present at the ceremony. After three cheers had been given for His Majesty the King and the National Anthem sung, the Proclamation was read, and then interpreted to the natives.\n\nThe \"Messina\" left at 4 o'clock p.m. on the 8th inst., returning to Rabaul with the Administrator. Twenty-six of the 30 Germans on the Island have been deported, and are now on the \"Messina\" which left for Sydney on the 14th inst.

The Caroline, Pelew and Ladrone Groups were purchased from the Spaniards after the Spanish-American War for 850,000l.\n\nOf the above group Bismarck Archipelago - better known as German New Guinea - is the most important. It comprises a large slice of New Guinea and includes New Britain, New Ireland, New Hanover, and numerous small islands - the Admiralty, Natty, Exchequer, Hermit, Anchorite, French, Gervit Denys, Sir Charles Hardy, St. John, St. Mathas, Squally Islands, and others.\n\nAn English missionary, Dr. Brown, tells us that when he arrived in the Bismarck Archipelago in 1875, there was not a single white man there. A little trade with Sydney had commenced - by Sydney vessels calling off the coast and Purchasing food and tortoise-shell from the natives, who put off to them in canoes. Shortly after, Captain Hernsheim, a German, came along and settled in the islands and that was really the commencement of German trade in that part of the world.\n\nMost of the German Pacific possessions fell into her hands between 1884 and 1899. Dr. Brown, in a recent interview with a newspaper representative in Sydney, expressed regret that it ever became German property. \"In 1886,\" he said, \"we worked up a very strong agitation. We pleaded with the British Government to annex the whole of the islands, not in a spirit of earth hunger, but for the protection of the natives. We warned the British Government about the danger of German annexation. The only result of our agitation and our pleading, however, was that we were openly laughed at in the House of Commons. Lord Berby replied to us to say that he had the most authentic information that Germany had not the faintest idea or intention of stepping in to annex the islands. And yet the ink was hardly dry on the official cablegrams before the news arrived that Germany had annexed them.\"\n\nYet the veteran missionary spoke well of German rule in the Pacific. He said the military caste of Germany had not shown its head in the Pacific. The great advantage to German rule was that they sent peaceful methodical men as administrators - Dr. Solf to Samon and Dr. Hahl to New Britain, and the system of government initiated by these two men has, invariably, been fair to all classes, natives Germans and British alike.\n\nThe high opinion expressed about Dr. Hahl is, we believe, shared by the native population, in whom the Doctor took a fatherly interest, considering it a sacred trust to raise these ignorant, primitive children of the wilds to a higher plane. The same view, however, is not held by the German residents. In their opinion, Dr. Hahl's philanthropic ideas greatly checked the development of the possessions, and on him is also thrown the blame for Rabaul not being fortified and garrisoned with Germany troops. However that may be Dr. Hahl's influence in Berlin had been undermined, and when he went to Germany some time ago on a 12 months'holiday, it was considered that he had left for good. His place was temporarily filled by Dr. Haber, the official in charge of affairs at the time of the British annexation.\n\nTo what extent Dr. Hahl's efforts, in elevating the native population, succeeded is perhaps hard to say. They have partly been transformed from cannibals to an apparently peace-loving people; noris the general opinion of a decline in number verified by statistics - just the opposite; they have so far been kept fairly clean from venereal diseases. The experimental attempts in introducing the German language amongst them has, however, utterly failed, whereas most of them can speak a quasi English - \"Pigeon English\" - as it is called. probably from \"Beach English,\" signifying the fragments of English picked up by the coast population from early traders. It is extremely interesting that a German in speaking to his native servant must resort to English, and it proves that also in regard to languages - \"the fittest survive.\"\n\nWith regard to the development of German New Guinea from a purely commercial point of view, it appears to us that the Germans have done remarkably well, and, although the German Government in its colonial politics has often spent money more lavishly than wisely, considerable progress has certainly been made. One need only look at the beautiful plantations scattered all over her Pacific possessions, one of them so huge that it employs 1000 native labourers, or pay a casual visit to places like Rabaul, Herbertshohe, Friederick Wilhelmshafen or Kawieang. Take Rabaul, the capital, as the most striking sample - beautifully laid out, fine Government and private buildings, a splendid jetty, boat building establishment, spacious warehouses, a well rega-\n\nSPORT AND AMUSEMENTS.\nFootball Match.\n\nOn Saturday, the 14th inst., the Naval Reserve Soccer Team under Petty Officer Lonergan, journeyed from Herbertshohe, and played a representative team from \"D\" Company. The visitors were met on arrival by the secretary, Corporal Graham. After a keenly contested match, and much to the surprise of the local lads, the visitors won easily, the final scores being: Herbertshohe, captained by A.B. Stubbs, 4 goals; \"D\" Company, captained by B. Bullock, 1 goal. Arrangements are being made to play the Naval team a return match at Herbertshohe on the 21st inst., and as \"D\" Company's team are doing plenty of hard training for this match, it is almost certain that the scores will be easily reversed when the teams meet again.\nAt the conclusion of the match the visitors were entertained at a banquet and smoke social, held in the Signalers' Quarters. Sergeant T.L. Gitsham, chairman of \"D\" Company's Sports Club, occupied the chair.\n\nThe chairman, in a few well chosen remarks, welcomed the visitors to Rabaul, and trusted that the short time they spent in Rabaul would be a pleasant one, also when \"D\" Company visited Herbertshohe, the same sportsmanlike spirit would prevail, and that the best team would win. After the usual toasts were drank an adjournment was made to the balcony when a musical evening was given, at which the following contributed items:- Petty Officer Lonergan. Sergeant Gitsham, Messrs. Bullock, Stubbs, McGlashan, Milne, Brown, Martin, Besson, Johnson, and Loan. The accompaniments were played by Bugler Chapman in his usual first class style. The singing of Auld Lang Syne and the National Anthem, brought a very pleasant evening to a close.\nEntertainment by the Flying Column.\n\nTwo concerts have been successfully carried out by the Flying Column since our last issue. At both of these the individual turns were of a very high order and would have been enjoyed by any gathering of music lovers. The structure in which the concerts have been given - styled as the \"Cafe-de-Tray-Bit\" - was far too small to accommodate the would-be patrons. Great difficulties had to be surmounted in order that a suitable stage might be made and the results reflects great credit upon those responsible for the work. The first half of both these entertainment comprised a lengthy list of solos, recitations, monologues, etc., and every item was well received - encores being in great demand. The second part of the programme on both occasions brought to light original dramatic sketches. These proved to be thrilling and nerve-tingling. The piece staged at the second night's show had a local setting and was quite in keeping with present surroundings, being a realistic and up-to-date military episode - the title being \"Lost and Found.\" The authors of these sketches - Privates Davis, Martin, Thompson, Poynting and Ballington - are to be congratulated upon the good work they have put into these pieces. Space forbids a detailed account, but one and all present voted the entertainment as excellent and hope that the men of the Left Half will not be content to rest on their laurels but will Endeavour to surpass these efforts to entertain their comrades.\n\nNOTICES.\n\nBritish Consul.\nIn the last issue of the \"Government Gazette\" the British Consul, Mr F.R.

A message was received from Frederick Wilhelmshafen to the effect that the health of the Troops there is unsatisfactory; there are two cases of black water fever, one serious.\n","81":"\n\nThe \"Yarra\" and \"Elax\" arrived at 7-0 a.m. Commander Keatley immediately called on the Administrator, and was handed the coded message referred to in yesterday's diary, the interpretation of which is as follows:-\n\n\"From Rabaul you are to proceed to Frederick Wilhelmshafen with \"Elax\", arriving there on Decr. 4th; \"Warrego\" and \"Parramatta\" will meet you there with orders.

The \"Gabriel\" referred to in the message is at present in dock at Vulcan Island. The troops will be despatched by the \"Nusa\" and \"Siar\" with the \"Yarra\" as escort, and will leave at daylight to-morrow.\n\nResignations of all the German Officials at present acting in an advisory capacity for the present Administration were received by the Administrator. This step has evidently been taken as a protest against the public flogging of certain Germans which took place yesterday. The Administrator will interview these Officials at 9-0 a.m. to-morrow.\n\nCaptains Ralston and Twynam returned from New Ireland at 6-0 p.m., having with them Herr Wienand, one of the principal offenders in the assault on the Rev.

The Administrator requested the Captain not to leave for Sydney until 4-0 p.m.\n\nThe punishments awarded by the Administrator to the Prisoners implicated in the assault on the Rev. Mr. Cox, and enumerated in diary of the 28th instant, were publicly inflicted. Prior to this Dr. Weber had written to the Administrator asking that the sentence to flog the prisoners be not carried out. A petition signed by all the German residents in Rabaul was also handed to the Administrator, who publicly announced that the punishments decided upon must be awarded. After being dealt with the Prisoners were sent on board the \"Morinda\" under a guard.\n\nThe \"Siar\" returned from the Hermit and Admiralty Islands at 11-0 a.m. with Major Heritage and Captain Travers on board. A garrison under Lieut. Hext, R.A.N.R., consisting of 12 men was left at the Government Station Loringow, Manus Island.

Landing at Herbertshohe.\"\nThis man was brought to Rabaul and placed in guard tent pending further action being taken.\n\n\n\n(2)\n\nThe Court enquiring into the shooting of Private McGill at Namatanai, found that this was purely accidental. McGill was returned to Australia in the \"Morinda\".\n\nAt 8-0 p.m. the following message was received from the Chief of the General Staff:-\n\"Send names of Officers, and numbers and ranks others recommended by you and willing to remain to end of war: similar information yourself and staff and Naval Unit, so that relief force may be organized at once.\"\n\nand at 8-0 p.m. from Navy Office:-\n\"His Majesty the King directs that in view of the war salutes are not to be fired, and ships are not to be dressed on the occasion of the birthday of her Majesty Queen Alexandra.\"\n\nA message in cipher 'R' for H.M.A.S. \"Yarra\" to be delivered to her on arrival was also received.

The ship's course was directed first for Lambutju Island.\n\n20th November: Nil\n\n21st November: Lambutju was sighted at 4-0 p.m. On this island there is a plantation belonging to Captain Komine. It was here ascertained that the vessel \"Lloyd' was at Hermit Islands. At 6pm the \"Siar\" left for Komuli of the St. Andrews Group. this is the head station of Hernsheim and Coy. On arrival at 10pm the oath of neutrality was administered to 5 Germans by Capt. Travers and cargo for that station was landed.

Left Komuli at 6-0 a.m. for Loringow, Government Station Manus Island (Seeadler Haven), which place was reached at 1pm, Captain Travers taking charge of force landed under Lieut. Hext. The arrival was a complete surprise, and as soon as the Government Officials noticed soldiers they gathered all the Native Police, and taking arms, ammunition an provisions made for the bush. Captain Travers was successful in capturing the head Official and explained the terms of capitulation to him, and directed him to go out and bring the other Officials and Native Police. At first he refused to do this, but finally consented, and being placed on parole was sent out to bring in the whole force. During the interval all buildings were seized and placed under guard; the German Flag was hauled down and the British Flag hoisted in its place. Within half an hour the whole force had returned and were disarmed. Government books and money were handed over. The amount of 634 M. 42 Pf. was found in the Treasury in addition, besides stamps and post cards to the value of 1295 M. 97 Pf., together with 405 M. in the Post Office. The stamps and post cards will be taken to Rabaul and surcharged. All rations and stores were landed, but some delay was occasioned owing to the breaking of steam crane on the \"Siar\". the Super-cargo (Burguart) has been the cause of some considerable trouble. One hundred bags of Government rice were left on board and will be discharged on our return. Driver Maynehan, machine gun section, was placed under arrest for being drunk while on duty. The \"Siar\" left for Pitelu, a small Island on the opposite side of Seeadler Haven at 5-0 p.m., leaving garrison in charge at Loringow. Pitelu was reached at 7pm; this is a small island where Capt. Komine has another plantation. Cargo for this plantation and for the Catholic Mission was discharged and sufficient water to last 6 days was taken on board.\n\n23rd November: Finished watering at 11-30 p.m. During the morning Major Heritage, although still suffering with fever, landed and with Captain Travers breakfasted with Mrs. Komine. A Native 'sing sing' was held in honor of the British occupation, and Captain Travers addressed the Natives and explained the situation to them. Driver Mayneham was given 2 days detention and stoppage of pay for being drunk and disorderly at Loringow. Left Pitelu for Hares Haven at noon. Arrived of Naro at 5-0 a.m. and signalled for boat.

In the meantime the \"Siar searched for the boat already referred to, which proved later to be a motor boat. The ship returned to Maron at 2-0 p.m. It was ascertained from Herr Schilling (Manager of Whalen's Plantations) that the Cruiser 'Cormoran' (old Russian) was at Maron on the 5th and appears now to be in hiding somewhere in New Guinea.

Took on board 321 bags copra, and left at 12pm for Loringow. At 4-0 p.m. in mid-ocean passed a Native canoe flying the British flag. We stopped, and the Native Chief (Lului) explained that the flag had been in his possession for some considerable time, but he was prohibited from flying it under German Law. Hearing of our occupation he was flying the flag. He was given 10sticks of tobacco. At 5-30 p.m. Captain Komine was landed in a boat at Pitelu; he will return to Loringow to-morrow. At 6-30 p.m. arrived at Loringow. Captain Travers landed and found all things quiet at the garrison.

Captain Komine put off in the Ship's boat. It was feared that the Native Crew (3 Boys, 1 Mary and a Piccaninny) would be found dead, but there were no signs of the crew. Evidence of the construction of a raft being present. The engine and all removable parts were taken out of the Schooner, and the ship proceeded at 5-0 p.m. direct for Rabaul.\n\n29th November:\n It was expected that the ship would arrive at Rabaul late this evening, but owing to the heavy seas and head wind, we will not arrive until to-morrow.\n\n30th November:\n Arrived at Rabaul at 11-0 a.m. 3 Officials from Loringow, together with the Wife and Child of the Head Commissioner (Herr Kraft) were at once transferred to the \"Morinda\", which leaves at 4-0 p.m. for Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nDIARY OF EVENTS IN CONNECTION WITH AUSTRALIAN NAVAL AND MILITARY EXPEDITION UNDER THE COMMAND OF COLONEL WILLIAM HOLMES, D.S.O., V.D.\n\nFORTNIGHT ENDED - 27TH DECEMBER, 1914\n:\n\n(\n14-12-14 to 27-12-14\n) \n\n\n\nSUNDAY - 27TH DECR. 1914\n\nChurch Parade was held at Rabaul and Herbertshohe.\n\nCommander Jackson reports that he has received a wireless signal from the \"Fantome\", stating that the vessel was unable to get in touch with the \"Eastern\", being continually jammed by wireless signals of a ship with a pure telefunken note, which was considered to be mot more than 20 miles distant. Commander Jackson dispatched a reply to the \"Fantome\" from the \"Una\", without reference to the Administrator, instructing her to intercept the \"Eastern\" from Nauru, and direct her to return direct to Rabaul without calling at the Admiralty Islands.\n\nThe \"Matupi\" returned from Kaiwieng, and Captain Thorold reports that the \"Fantome\" had informed him of the jamming of W\/T signals by strange ship.\n\nPatients in hospital are progressing as well as can be expected.\n\nSATURDAY - 26TH DEC. 1914:\n\nThe \"Meklong\" returned at 11-0 a.m. with relieved garrison from Kieta. Lieut. Maughan, who has been in charge, reports all quiet in that locality.\n\nDuring the outward voyage, Lieut. Holmes, representing the Administrator, relieved the Master of the \"Meklong\" (sub-Lieut. Sparling, R.N.R.), for endangering the lives of those on board on account of his being in a state of drunkenness. Sub-Lieut. Sparling has been brought back to Rabaul and is at present under arrest. He will be brought before the Administrator on Monday morning next, 29th instant. Copy of Lieut. Holmes' report on the expedition is attached.\n\nFresh cases of Malaria have been admitted to hospital.\n\n\n\nRABAUL, 28th December 1914.\n\nThe Administrator:\n\nDIARY AND REPORT OF RELIEF EXPED. TO KIETA:\n\nS.S. \"Meklong\" left Rabaul at 4-30 pm on Sunday, 20th Dec. under the Command of Sub-Lieut. Sparling, R.N.R., having on board 28 soldiers all told, who are to relieve Lieut. Maughan at Kieta, under the command of Capt. Ogilvie, Lieut. Laycock, 2nd in command and Capt. Ford, Medical Officer. I was detailed to represent the Administrator and gave Lieut. Maughan his instructions, etc. at Kieta. Also had on board a German namedZoeller who took the oath of neutrality in Rabaul, and is being returned to the nearest place we call at to Soraken. Stopped at Herbertshohe to pick up 19 returned labor boys for H.S.A.G., three of these boys to be returned to Numa Numa and 16 to Kieta. Heavy rain all night.\n\n21st Decr:\n Made a good passage across, sighting Buka at about 2-30 p.m. The Captain decided to go through the Buka Straits, so we entered the Straits at 4-30 p.m. and anchored for the night off the island of Pilato, where there is a store of Hernsheim & Coy. run by a Chinaman. The German Zoeller was put ashore here as we received word that a cutter from Soraken was expected next day recruiting boys.\n\n22nd. Decr: Got under weigh from Pilato at 5-30 a.m. and safely negotiated the remainder of the Buka Straits. Just as we cleared the Straits, the Captain of the Ship (Sparling) was noticed to be under the influence of liquor, and kept the ship on a course N. by W., all the time talking wildly about reefs in the vicinity and saying that the chart was incorrect. The chart shows no reefs in the locality and Capt. Strassburg on my trip with him assured me there were no reefs here, and that the North Coast of Bougainville was free from reefs altogether, and Strassburg kept the ship within 20 yards of the shore all the way. The Captain came on the bridge at 9-35 a.m. still under the influence of liquor and talked to the 2nd Mate in Pidgin English about the reefs off the points on the North Coast of Bougainville. At 9-50 a.m. the Captain giving such rotten sailing directions and threatening to fight boys at wheel, I took charge of the ship and altered course to E. He was steering into Banio thinking he was going to Numa Numa.\n\n10 a.m. interviewed Captain in his cabin and told him that I would remain in charge of ship till he stopped running on such erratic courses. 10-30 a.m. had another interview with Captain in his cabin and told him that I was in charge of ship, and until further orders he was to remain in his cabin, and that I would consider what I would do with him when he was sober. He asked me to give him a chance and not report him. I said I would talk to him when he was sober. 11-0 a.m. appointed A.B. Jackson Mate, to take charge of ship, and wrote down in ship's log all that had taken place till this time. 11-15 a.m. course altered to E.S.E. 11-45 a.m. Tinputz abeam. 11-55 a.m. Officially informed the Engineer that the Capt. was relieved of his command, and until further notice disregard any instructions he might received from Captain. Informed Engineer that Jackson was in charge of ship. At 12-50 p.m. interviewed Sparling again and he pleaded with me to give him back command of the ship and not to report him as it would break him. I told him that the matter had already been logged, and would be reported in Rabaul on our return, and that I had placed Jackson in charge of ship till further orders and told him he was to keep off bridge and he was a passenger till we got to Kieta, where I would consider the matter again. Numa Numa abeam at 3-30 p.m. It was found that we could not reach Kieta tonight, so it was decided to anchor off Cape Le Kras inside the reef; the passage through\n\n-1-\n\n-through-\nthe reef was safely negotiated and ship anchored in 15 fathoms at 5-50 p.m. Wind and rain storm encountered off Numa Numa at 3-30 p.m. Three returned labor boys put ashore here at their own request and left to find their own way back to Numa Numa.\n\n23rd Dec.:\n Weighed anchor 5-45 a.m. and got under way for Kieta, going outside the reefs and islands in this locality. 8-50 a.m. at the Captain's request had another interview with him when he again pleaded with me not to report him. He said he had two whiskeys and a rum coming through the Straits and the mixture of spirits made him drunk. I told him that I would not be doing my duty if I did not report him. I told him that I would explain that he navigated the ship through the Buka Straits in an excellent fashion. Arrived at Kieta at 9-15 a.m.; went ashore and gave Lieut. Maughan his instructions. Capt. Ogilvie and Lieut. Maughan spent the day in talking things over. At 2-0 p.m. Lieut Cooper, A.B. Jackson and self went over to Kobuan Bay to have a look at the place where the Buka was sunk, which was located by Lieut. Maughan's men. We found she was sunk in 96 feet of water close to the shore in a small Bight in Kobuan Bay. Returned to Meklong at 4-0 p.m. and noticed that Sparling was walking about the main deck and under the influence of liquor, notwithstanding that he gave me his word of honour that he would not take another drop of liquor on the voyage. Went on board the Meklong again at 7-0 p.m. and found Sparling hopelessly drunk lying in his cabin. Col. Sergt. Mostyn (of relieving force) was with me, and I instructed him to search the cabin for any liquor. He did not find any whatsoever. I then asked Sparling where he kept his beer and whisky, and he replied in a very dunken voice that it was all gone. I then instructed Col. Sergt. to remove the Ship's chronometer and the Sextant, which is Sparling's private property, and put them in a safe place for the night. I informed Sparling that I would commandeer his Sextant till the Ship got back to Rabaul. To-morrow morning when Sparling is sober I will clear him out of the Captain's cabin into a cabin on the main deck, and put the Mate in the Captain's cabin. At my request Capt. Ogilvie placed a guard on ship for the night to prevent any soldiers going on board and also to guard certain provisions which are on the ship to feed Lt. Maughan's men on the return journey. Gave Hernsheim & Coy's representative permission to put on Meklong about 10 tons copra and 30 bags rice consigned to Hernsheim & Coy. Rabaul.\n\n24th Dec:\n I slept in Commissioners' residence last night and proceeded on board Meklong at 9-15 a.m. Interviewed Sparling and told him to shift all his gear on to the main deck and take up his quarters there. Ordered the Mate (Jackson) to take up his quarters in the Capt's cabin. The ship was all ready to sail at 10-30 a.m. but owing to Lt. Maughan's Police Master being on an exped. down the coast, had to delay the time of sailing indefinitely till he returned. Lt. Maughan sent out an exped. to bring him back at 6-0 a.m. 12 Noon sent word to Jackson to have steam up and be prepared to sail at 3-30 p.m. Everything on board and ready to sail at 3-30. 3-30 p.m. Meklong drew out from wharf and got under weigh, having on board 54 soldiers, 3 Officers (Lts. Maughan, Cooper and Self), two German Prisoners, one who took the oath of neutrality and has been giving trouble (Pleiffer) and the other a German Missionary who refuses to take the oath. Sparling is also located aft with the prisoners but is not under arrest. 4-40 p.m. cleared Noto Reef outside Kieta and set course N.W. Heavy sea running and ship rolling a lot. I am going to keep watch and watch with 2nd Mate on return voyage. Left with Capt. Ogilvie M2000 to carry on administration. This money was in Kroning's box, which was left behind when he was removed.\n\n(3)\n\n25th Dec\n: Rounded North Cape of Buka at 7-30 a.m. Heavy swell running all day. Altered course into St. George's Channel at 11-0 p.m.\n\n26th Dec:\n Before closing my report, I would like to bring under your Excellency's notice the splendid services Rendered me by the Mate, A.B. Jackson, who, since Lieut. Sparling was relieve of command of the Ship, has proved himself a capable \"Captain\" and a competent and trustworthy navigator.\n\n(Sgd) Basil Holmes, Lieut\nA.D.C.\n\nFRIDAY - 25TH DECEMBER 1914:\n\nChristmas Day was observed as a general holiday.\n\nChristmas Cheer received by the \"Matunga\" and \"Eastern\" was distributed amongst the garrisons at Rabaul and Herbertshohe.\n\nThe Administrator gave an Official Dinner to Lieut.

Nelson for the relief of Garrison at Frederick Wilhelmshafen, and Posts at Eitape and Kaiserin Augusta River. Major Martin has been requested by the Administrator to remain at Wilhelmshafen as District Officer.\n\nCaptain Byrne, A.M.C., proceeded to Frederick Wilhelmshafen by the \"Matunga\" in order to make the necessary arrangements for handing over to the Medical Officer from Colonel Pethebridge's force. He will return to Rabaul by the \"Matunga\".\n\nMajor Martin has been asked to communicate with Commander Cumberlege (Destroyers), and request that the \"Siar\" and \"Nusa\" be returned to Rabaul as early as possible.\n\nThere are several cases of Malaria at Herbertshohe and Rabaul.\n\nWEDNESDAY - 23RD DECEMBER 14:\n\nA message has been received by a Schooner from Kaiwieng, stating that the \"Eastern\", after anchoring at that place, had swung around on to a reef.

Decr., other Officers, on hearing that the Administrator had decided to remain, asked to be allowed to reconsider their case, and an amended return is now being prepared.The wireless message to the Minister giving particulars of Officers and men willing to re-engage, not having been despatched, has been cancelled.\n\nThe following wireless message from Colonel Pethebridge to Minister Defence has been prepared for despatch:-\n\n\"Eastern\" and \"Una\" arrived Rabaul 17th; all well. After conferring with Administrator, and in view of the altered conditions due to absence of the enemy's ships, consider total force not exceeding 350 ample for whole of acquired possessions South of Equator. Understand about 50 Colonel Holmes force willing re-engage; that would therefore mean on that account, one more company of 100 need be sent from Australia.

The message referred to is that received from Secretary, Defence Department, on 25th November, and quoted in diary of that date, the correct translation of which is as follows:-\n\n\"Administrator: Colonel Pethebridge will administer as Commissioner, the Pacific Islands lately German North of Equator, \nyour\n jurisdiction (incorrectly shewn in previous message \"formal jurisdiction\") extending to all newly acquired possessions South of the Equator. What action do you propose as to further service of troops after completion of the six months term of enlistment; do you propose that a portion should be retained and the remainder return to Sydney? Additional supplies for troops will be despatched December.\"\n\nThe Administrator has now decided to remain and administer these Islands until the end of war, unless sooner relieved.\n\nPay to amount of £4,500 for troops was received by the \"Eastern\".\n\nMr. McDonald, Wireless Expert, arrived by the Eastern\" and has received instructions to report on and take charge of the erection of new wireless stations and re-construction of existing Stations in these Islands.

Comm. Bracegirdle, R.A.N., Lieut. Marsden, Gunner Young, R.A.N.R., and Seaman Peach R.A.N.R.\n\nThe position of the mine was found to be about 150 yards in front of the first trench. The electric wires leading to it were carried underground for fifteen feet. These were followed up until the mine was found in the middle of the road. The charge was found to be packed with dynamite in an iron pipe 4 in. in diam., laid about 4 feet below the crown of the road.\n\nI fired the mine by exploding a small dynamite charge against the end of the pipe. The crater resulting from the explosion was 27 ft. long (in the direction of the road), 15ft. wide at the top, 7 feet deep, and 'V' shaped in section.\n\n(Sgd.) B.T. Goadby. Lieut. R.A.E.\n\n9th January 1915.\n\nDear Travers\n\nOn Tuesday last, 5th inst., Lieut. Comm. Bracegirdle, R.A.N., Lieut. Goadby, R.A.E., and Lieut. Marsden, M.G.S., went out on the Bitapaka road and blew up one of the mines which we passed over on 11th Septr.\n\nThey placed a detonator at the end of the tube with about 4ft. fuze; the explosion that followed could be heard distinctly at Herbertshohe about 4 miles away in a direct line.\n\nI went out the next day, Wednesday, 6th inst., with a party to fill in hole made by the explosion, and found a hole 27 ft. long, 15ft wide and 8 ft. deep, but they had only exploded one of the mines, so I followed the wires of the first mine from a log at the side of the road, by digging a trench across the road, to the mine, which consisted of an iron tube 21ft. long, 12 in. in circumference packed loosely with 'Nobel's' dynamite. On top of the tube were placed between 2 and 3 cwt. of bolts and nuts, and above this was packed with solid blocks of coral.\n\nI carefully removed the coral, bolts and nuts and had the mine carried into the bush; Lieut. O.W. Gillam, R.A.N.R., S.W. Cameron, R.A.N.R., arrived on the scene, and I had the mine exploded with a detonator and about 3 ft. of fuze. The explosion was enormous, and small pieces of pipe were picked up 200 yards away; it made a very large hole, knocked over trees, and made a black cloud 200 ft. high, with a circumference of about 600 ft., within which it was absolutely dark for some minutes. One could not see their hand held up in front of one's face. The report was distinctly heard at Herbershohe.\n\nThe mines were 75 feet apart, placed along the road (not across). I attach a rough sketch of howthey were laid; if they had let them off when we were over them, we would not have known anything about it, there being enough explosives to blow a whole battalion to pieces.\n\nMidshipman William took a photograph of the one I unearthed as it lay in the trench. If possible I will send you a copy of it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n(Sgd.) T.A. Bond, Lieut. R.A.N.R.\n\nH.M.A.T. \"Eastern\"\nAt Sea - Jany. 10th 15.\n\nTo Colonel W. Holmes. D.S.O., V.D.\nCommanding 1st Aust. N. & M. Exped. Force.\n\nSubmit:\nOn Jan. 5th I was detailed by Lieut. Comm. L.S. Bracegirdle, R.A.N. Commanding Naval Garrison, Herbertshohe, New Britain, to proceed with Lieut. Bond. R.A.N.R. to restore that part of Kabakaul-Bitapaka road damaged by German mine, exploded by Lieut. Goadby, R.A.E. on previous day.\nI have to report that, while lunching, Lieut. Bond accidentally unearthed an electric lead.On investigation, we found that it led to a hitherto unknown German mine, 30 yards on Kabakaul side of the mine\nexploded by Lieut. Goadby.\nThe mine consisted of a cast iron pipe, 21ft x 3in. diam., packed with \"Noble's\" gelignite. Mine was buried longitudinally in middle of road, at a depth of approx. 2 ft. 6in., being covered by stones, coral, bolts and nails.\n\nLieut. Bond had mine removed into bush on left hand side of road leading towards Bitapaka - distance from road being about 50 to 60 yards.\nWhen mine was exploded, it caused a column of earth, etc. to be hurled about 150 ft. high. Surrounding trees were lacerated up to a height of 60 ft. Dirt and debris fell at a distance of 200 yards from scene of explosion. The explosion caused an excavation 30 ft. x 12ft. x 6ft. in depth approx. Explosion was heard at Herbertshohe, a distance of about 5 or 6 miles.\n\nYours obediently,\n(Sgd) R.S. Veale, M'man R.A.N.R.\n\n\n\n\n\nHERBERTSHOHE,\n8\/1\/15.\n\nMajor Heritage:\n\nSubmitted herewith report on German Mines, exploded 4th January, 1915, on Kaba Kaul - Bita Paka road, for your information.\nLieut. Goadby and myself, having been instructed by C.C. Herbershohe Garrison to report on the advisability of blowing up the mines that were believed to be in the vicinity of the first trench proceeded to Kaba Kaul on the morning of the Jan 4th.\n\nMr. Young (Gunner R.A.N.) was also of the party, and, with his assistance, the wire lead of No. 2 Mine was found in the bush close to the road. This wire had been cut just above the ground, and about 6 feet from the roadway.The lead was uncovered, and found to run along the bottom of a trench, about 3ft. 6 in. below the surface, and in the direction of the centre of the road.\nWhen the charge was reached, it was found to consist of Noble's dynamite, placed inside a hollow steel tube 4 in. in diam. and 21ft. in height (length). The tube was completely filled with dynamite - I should say approx. 1 cwt.\nThis tube was placed in the bottom of a trench, about 4ft. deep, running down the centre of the road, and was covered with a large quantity of stone and scrap iron. The mine was laid to fire by electricity, and I am of opinion that it failed to fire owing to bad insolation.\n\nIt was decided to fire the mine for the sake of safety, and a Commercial Cap (No. 6) and Fuze had to be used. When the explosion took place stones and scrap iron were thrown clear above the tree tops (at least 200 ft. high) and a large hole 28ft. long and 15ft. wide, and about 9ft. deep torn in the roadway.\nA second mine, shown on sketch as No. 1, was found by a working party under Lieut. Bond while repairing the road. Its position was only 25 yards from No. 2 Mine, and I should think it was the intention of the Germans fire both mines at once. It was laid in the same way as No. 2 Mine, in a trench dug down the centre of the road, and consisted of approx. 1 cwt. of dynamite enclosed in a similar steel tube and covered with stones and scrap iron. This mine was removed and exploded in the bush some distance from the road.\n\n(Sgd.)

The administration of the Colony will be handed over to Colonel Pethebridge to-morrow, and on the following day the Administrator will go one board the \"Eastern\" and return to Australia by that vessel. The \"Eastern\" will not leave Rabaul until the arrival of the \"Morinda.\"\n\nAt 11-30 a.m. the Administrator interviewed the Officers who have been in charge of the various Administrative Departments. He explained fully the situation, and he asked them to give every possible assistance to Colonel Pethebridge on his taking up as Administrator. Colonel Pethebridge will interview these Officers to-morrow regarding their respective Departments.

D.S.O., V.D.\n\nFORTNIGHT ENDED -","94":"\n\n28\/12\/14 - 10\/1\/15 \n\nSUNDAY - 10TH JANUARY 1915:\n\nOrders for the general discipline of the Ship were issued, and fire and boat stations were allotted to each member of the Force.\n\nOwing to heavy rain, Church Parade was abandoned.\n\nAttached are copies of reports submitted relative to mines placed on the Kabakaul-Bitapaka Road prior to the arrival of our Forces in September last.\n\nThe undermentioned Medical Officers and Nurses were on board the S.S. \"Morinda\" for Rabaul:-\n\nCaptain J.F. Hayes\n do P.S. Parkinson\nNurse F.M. McIntosh\n do I.C. McIntosh\n do E. Henry\n do N. Gibbons\n\nP.M.O. reports upwards of twenty cases of Malaria on board. Large doses of quinine are being administered.\n\nAt midnight the ship had sailed 272 nautical miles - 322 miles since leaving Rabaul\n\nLands Office,\nHerbertshohe,\nJany. 7th 1915.\n\nActing in accordance with a Garrison Order issued at Herbertshohe, giving me instructions to inspect and destroy a German land mine on the road from Bitapaka W\/T Station to Kabakaul, I proceeded to the place, accompanied by Lieut. Comm. Bracegirdle, R.A.N, Lieut. Marsden, Gunner Young, R.A.N.R., and Seaman Peach R.A.N.R.\n\nThe position of the mine was found to be about 150 yards in front of the first trench. The electric wires leading to it were carried underground for fifteen feet. These were followed up until the mine was found in the middle of the road. The charge was found to be packed with dynamite inn an iron pipe 4 in. in diam., laid about 4 feet below the crown of the road.\n\nI fired the mine by exploding a small dynamite charge against the end of the pipe. The crater resulting from the explosion was 27 ft. long (in the direction of the road), 15ft. wide at the top, 7 feet deep, and 'V' shaped in section.\n\n(Sgd.) B.T. Goadby, Lieut. R.A.E.\n\n9th JANUARY 1915.\n\nDear Travers;\n\nOn Tuesday last, 5th inst., Lieut. Comm. Bracegirdle, R.A.N., Lieut. Goadby, R.A.E., and Lieut. Marsden, M.G.S., went out on the Bitapaka Road and blew up one of mines which we passed over on 11th Septr.\n\nThey placed a detonator at the end of the tube with about 4ft. fuze; the explosion that followed could be heard distinctly at Herbertshohe about 4 miles away in a direct line.\n\nI went out the next day, Wednesday, 6th inst., with a party to fill in hole made by the explosion, I found a hole 27 ft. long 15 ft wide and 8 ft. deep, but they had only exploded one of the mines, so I followed the wires of the first mine from a log at the side of the road, by digging a trench across the road to the mine, which consisted of an iron tube 21 ft long, 12 in. in circumference, packed closely with 'Nobel's' dynamite. On top of the tube were placed between 2 and 3 cwt. of bolts and nuts, and above this was packed with solid blocks of coral.\n\nI carefully removed the coral, bolts and nuts and had the mine carried into the bush; Lieut. O.W. Gillam, R.A.N.R., S.W. Cameron, R.A.N.R., arrived on the scene, and I had the mine exploded with a detonator and about 3 ft. of fuze. The explosion was enormous, and small pieces of pipe were picked up 200 yards away; it made a very large hole, knocked out trees, and made a black cloud 200 ft. high, with a circumference of about 600 ft., within which it was absolutely dark for some minutes. One could not see their hand held up in front of one's face. The report was distinctly heard at Herbertshohe.\n\nThe mines were 75 feet apart, placed along the road (not across). I attach a rough sketch of how they were laid; if they had let them off when we were over them, we would not have known anything about it, there being enough explosives to blow a whole battalion to pieces.\n\nMidshipman William took a photograph of the one I unearthed as it lay in the trench. If possible I will send you a copy of it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) T.A. Bond, Lieut. R.A.N.R.\n\n\n\nH.M.A.T. \"Eastern\",\nAt Sea - Jany. 10th 15.\n\nTo Colonel W. Holmes, D.S.O., V.D.\nCommanding 1st Aust. N.& M. Exped. Force.\n\nSubmit:\n\nOn Jan. 5th I was detailed by Lieut. Comm. L.S. Bracegirdle, R.A.N. Commanding Naval Garrison, Herbertshohe, New Britain, to proceed with Lieut. Bond, R.A.N.R. to restore that part of Kabakaul-Bitapaka road damaged by German mine, exploded by Lieut. Goadby, R.A.E. on previous day.\n\nI have to report that, while lunching, Lieut. Bond accidentally unearthed an electric lead.\n\nOn investigation we found that it led to a hitherto unknown German mine, 30 yards on Kabakaul side of the mine exploded by Lieut Goadby.\n\nThe mine consisted of a cast iron pipe, 21ft x 3in. diam., packed with \"noble's\" gelignite. Mine was buried longitudinally in middle of road, at a depth of approx. 2 ft. 6in., being covered by stones, coral, bolts and nails.\n\nLieut. Bond had mine removed into bush on left hand side of the road leading towards Bitapaka - distance from road being about 50 to 60 yards.\n\nWhen mine was exploded, it caused a column of earth, etc. to be hurled about 150ft. high. Surrounding trees were lacerated up to a height of 60ft. Dirt and debris fell at a distance of 200 yards from scene of explosion. The explosion caused an excavation 30 ft. x 12ft. x 6ft. in depth approx. Explosion was heard at Herbertshohe, a distance of about 5 or 6 miles.\n\nYours obediently,\n(Sgd) R.S. Veale, M'man R.A.N.R.\n\nHERBERTSHOHE,\n8\/1\/15.\n\nMajor Heritage:\n\nSubmitted herewith report on German Mines, exploded 4th January, 1915, on Kaba Kaul - Bita Paka road, for your information.\n\nLieut. Goadby and myself, having been instructed by O.C. Herbertshohe Garrison to report on the advisability of blowing up the mines that were believed to be in the vicinity of the first trench, proceeded to Kaba Kaul on the morning of the Jan 4th.\n\nMr. Young (Gunner R.A.N.) was also of the party, and, with his assistance, the wire lead of No. 2 Mine was found in the bush close to the road. This wire had been cut just above the ground, and about 6 feet from the roadway.\n\nThe lead was uncovered, and found to run along the bottom of a trench, about 3ft. 6 in. below the surface, and in the direction of the centre of the road.\n\nWhen the charge was reached, it was found to consist of Noble's dynamite, placed inside a hollow steel tube 4 in. in diam. and 21ft in height (length). The tube was completely filled with dynamite - I should say approx. 1 cwt.\n\nThis tube was placed in the bottom of a trench, about 4ft. deep, running down the centre of the road, and was covered with a large quantity of stone and scrap iron. The mine was laid to fire by electricity, and I am of opinion that it failed to fire owing to bad insulation.\n\nIt was decided to fire the mine for the sake of safety, and a Commercial Cap (No. 6) and Fuze had to be used. When the explosion took place stones and scrap iron were thrown clearn above the tree tops (at least 200 ft. high) and a large hole 28ft. long and 15ft. wide, and about 9ft. deep torn in the roadway.\n\nA second mine, shown on sketch as No. 1, was found by a working party under Lieut. Bond while repairing the road. Its position was only 25 yards from No. 2 Mine, and I should think it was the intention of the Germans to fire both mines at once. It was laid in the same way as No. 2 Mine, in a trench dug down the centre of the road, and consisted of approx. 1 cwt. of dynamite enclosed in a similar steel tube and covered with stones and scrap iron. This mine was removed and exploded in the bush some distance from the road.\n\n(Sgd.)
