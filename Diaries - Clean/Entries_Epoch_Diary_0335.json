Starting a new Diary from the 10th – one I bought in Amiens on the 9th.\n\nThis is a very scrappy Diary – written in all kinds of places and under all kinds of conditions. Some of the parts are written in pencil & are almost faded or rubbed out. You will notice that I have been trying to ink it over in some of these places. But although it is very scrappy & dirty & untidy I will be able to tell you lots of things with it to refresh my memory that I might not otherwise be able to think of. I hope it will reach home safely.\n\nLove from Your EM\n\n"}}
