The night of the 25th was spent at Liverpool Camp, all kits had been sent to A 35, the Berrima.\n\nThe last night in Australia was very cold indeed and a roll call was made at midnight. \n\nAn early rise was made amid a kind of silent excitement, a roll call taken and the blankets rolled up ready to be taken to the Depot.\n\nAt 8 A.M. The 20TH Battalion paraded for the last time and were inspected by the Colonel. Shortly afterwards the Battalion with machine guns, signallers and band marched off in full marching order with bayonets fixed, and scabbards on.\n\nThe Battalion was cheered all along the route and there was a lot of shaking of hands. The entrainment was very rapid, it being done in 10 minutes.\n\nIt was a stiring and memorable time, we were cheered and waved at all along the line and at length arrived at Sydney Station. The march down to the boat was a very sad one and for ever will be remembered by all the 20th. The ladies got into the ranks and there was a very deep feeling amongst us all. It made one inclined to cry as lads dragged themselves away from their people, girls and etc and pass through the gate to the wharf.\n\nAfter a short delay in order to form up the men we went on board the Berrima were allotted messes and remained down below until the District Commandant, Colonel Wallack inspected us. My parade state being ready and the inspection being over I gave the words Go on deck\", there was a mad rush for the deck all being very anxious to get a last look at their people. The cheers were loud and long which caused a ships officer to remark those people are loyal alright\". You could read in every mans eyes deep feelings working and many could not help giving way to tears. All those over strength were sent back by a waiting tug as the ship had pulled out into the harbour. When we got outside the Heads the sea became a little rough which caused most of the troops to feed the fishes. During officers mess hurried leave to be absent was obtained from the Colonel. Before going outside the heads we were anchored off Rose Bay. \n\nThe pilot boat signalled Good luck and a safe return\" It was 5 pm the clock on the","2":" \n\nThat night was spent in settling down, the men learning how not to swing their hammocks.

The propeller shaft broke and we drifted at the rate of 50 miles an hour. When we got near the Island of Socotra the natives saw that we were helpless and tried to board us but were kept off with a horse whip and the life boat launched which brought us help in time.

It is very rocks and devoid of any kind of vegetation. Officers from the Indian troop ship\n\nJuly 24th (continued) Teesta visited the Berrima and had mess with the Military Officers on board. The night was spent at anchor in the harbour.\n","30":" We are in doubt as to whether we are to go by rail to Cairo or through the Canal.\n\nJuly 26th Disembarked at Suez and left for Cairo by rail. There are three classes on the Egyptian state railways, the 3rd class is used exclusively by the natives. Our rout lies through the desert with occasional oases at which the Stations are built. Stations show signs of European workmanship although they are very small and alive with natives selling all kinds of tropical fruit. Made a half way at a place called Zigazag at which we all hoped to get drinks as it was very hot. The train being late we are unable to get drinks and anyhow are informed that the canteen had been closed owing to some of the soldiers who had already passed through playing up. We were all very amused at the natives who tried to sell us grapes, melons and etc-. The native police tried their best to keep them off with big sticks but no sooner was the policemans back turned than they were at it again. The young natives who are nearly nude are first rate beggars and call out Backshies\" as they run along by the side of the train which passes by the edge of the road in places with no fence between.\n\nAfter a run of 6 hours we arrive in a very sleepy condition at Benhar ? at 11.30 a.m. and march to our camp which is about 2 1\/2 miles from the Station. Our camp is nothing but desert and the dust is beastly. The remainder of the Brigade are camped nearby and also the","31":" Light Horse, with some Artillery.\n","32":" The Officers Mess is started and the catering is very unsatisfactory, and also the natives, who wait on us, are miles too slow although they keep themselves clean. The bread is a very dark colour with a peculiar flavour which nobody likes.\n\nC\" Company was due for duty and we spent most of our time pitching tents. The tents are very fine and have an inner lining to make them cool, they hold 25 men. Some of the men are accommodated in huts built of match wood by the natives. Each is provided with a long table, one for each section.\n\nThere is a Mahomidan cemetery near by which we are requested to keep sacred. No green is visible anywhere, nothing but sand in view. The sun is very hot indeed and so it is arranged that we parade from 6 to 9 and from 5 to 7 at night. We have a lecture or indoor parade at 11 o’clock.\n","33":" We are inspected by Brigadier ,General Holmes who gave a very fine address on military subjects. He said we had three things to do in the way of training. Shoot, march and dig. The weather is very hot and oppressive and requires a lot of getting used to. We are al issued with shorts at 10 o’clock at night and informed that General Maxwell was to inspect the Battalion at 7 o’clock in the morning.\n","34":" General Maxwell inspected the Battalion and afterwards gave an address chiefly concerning discipline. A native boy came to the camp and gave an exhibition of rifle exercises and bayonet exercises showing very remarkable aptitude, it was impossible to give him an order which he could not correctly carry out. I gave a lecture on discipline to the Company. We four Subs have a tent to ourselves, it is a large E.P. Tent and one sleeps in each corner.\n\nWe all rushed out of the tent in order to obtain a photo of a native Corporal of Police who came along to the camp. The Native Police Corporal looks quite grand on his black horse and is delighted at the idea of having his photo taken. They carry a carbine slung over his shoulder.\n","35":" The shorts are a great improvement and are very comfortable. We have now all settled down to the conditions and are fairly comfortable. The sand and glare of the sun is very trying for the eyes. The climate is not quite so bad as we were led to believe and the general physique of the men as long as they keep away from the drink and women is good. There are wet canteens for all ranks. \n","36":" Nothing\n","37":" Visited the pyramids and Tombs. Mena House is ¾ of an hours ride from Cairo in the electric tram. We left the camp I the morning in a native four wheeled vehicle called a Garry accompanied by a native guide who we had engaged for the day for 1 pound, 100 Piastres. The guide paid all expenses. The day was very hot and we did not like the idea of getting out of our drill dress of shorts. \n\nArriving at the trams we had a soft drink and the guide asked us if we required anything to eat but as it was so early we said no. We went straight out to the Pyramids passing over the river Nile and some of its tributaries and finally finished up at the base of the pyramids, hired a camel each and rode up as far as we could get.\n\nIt was my first experience on a camel and in early got pitched off when the camel got up and down, their stride reminds one of a small boat on a rough sea although they can get up a fair pase. The one I had was ten years old and I was informed that they live about as long as a horse. \n","38":" continued We has our photo taken after the guide and the owner of the camels had argued for a considerable time and to which we had to put an end or they would have come to blows. The Sphinx was a few yards to our right, the Pyramids which are said to be 450 feet high a little further on. The guide got donkeys for us and we got aboard and speaking for myself I felt ashamed to get on the poor little animals, the saddle nearly slipped off as I got on and I found difficult in keeping my balance especially when the donkeys began to gallop. \n\nThe guide did not say where he was going, so we followed him blindly into the dusty desert all mounted on donkeys with native boys running behind us with sticks to make the donkeys go. The sand was very difficult for us to walk in but the donkeys did not seem to be bothered in the least. We passed sand dunes and mounds, a native cemetery, villages and some Indian wheat cultivations which were irrigated from Sarduffs, these are scattered all over the place and are about 12 to 30 feet deep and from 6 to 10 feet in diameter. When we passed one large brick building well covered in with trees, the guide informed us that it was an English Company.\n\nOur guide was fairly intelligent but his English was far from perfect. He told us that the natives work by piece work and not time, they have two harvests in the year. After a long and rather tedious journey on the not overly comfortable mounts we arrived near some ruined pyramids and our guide took us up to the tombs of the old Kings of Egypt who had died hundreds of years B.C. The walls were covered with carvings of all kinds of animals, donkeys, camels, cows, cows being slaughtered which by the way means that they pull its tongue out.\n\nThe vaults which contain the bodies are carved out of solid granite of great weight and covered with a massive lid of same material, the sides have carvings and are polished. We visited four of these tombs built underneath the ground and then went to a native house close by and refreshed ourselves with a large water melon.\n\nOur return journey was uneventful but rather wearysome , McDonalds saddle slipped round when he was offering the guide a cigarette. The guide had not eaten anything all day and did not smoke till 7 of the clock, he then looked at the sun and asked for a cigarette saying he had come to the end of the fast of Ramadon.\n\nOur guide also had a long drink of water which he obtained from the first native village he came to. We had travelled at least 19 miles on the poor donkeys over the rough sand. We then returned to Cairo by tram and had dinner. The guide kindly informed us that if we required a good lady\" he could get us one. A card by some means was placed in each officers tint with a name and address on. \n","39":" 2nd.3rd.4th.5th.6th.7th.

First we had as issue of colours, our colours being a diamond shape with green on the lower half and white the upper half, green standing for the Bde. and white the Battalion. They are to be worn one inch below the shoulder. We were issued with Enfield revolvers which are out of date and misfire now and again. Orders were issued that we were to take nothing more than could be carried on our backs. We wore our shorts, tunics and hats and full wed equipment, Officers as well as men.\n\nForms had to be filled in as to next of kin and so on to be left at the base in case we were among the unfortunate ones not to return. Our boxes packed we sent them to Messers. Cooks, Cairo for safe keeping and I hope mine will be safe as all my papers are in it, certificates and credentials. Our departure was unexpected and rather hurried. If I remember right it was on Sunday that a full Parade of Officers and N.C.Os. was ordered and we were all marched to the parade by the Adjutant and formed into a square with the Officers and N.C.Os. of the other Battalions of the Bde. General Legge Commanding the","47":" Division gave us a very fine speech and wished General Holmes (Brigadier) and the Bde. the best of luck and hoped he would join us soon.\n\nAll leave was stopped and a careful roll call taken. Major O'Halloran was sent to the","48":" training Btn with Liet. Mc Donald. Captain Arnold was sent to the","49":" and Captain Ross came to C\" Company of the","50":"\n\nThe change was in some ways advantageous but we all very much regretted Mc Donald leaving us and are assured that it was only ill feeling that caused the change to be made. For a Company to go into action for the first time short of two officers appears to me to be idiotic and the action of ignorant people.\n\nAugust continued. We were told that we were to relieve the 1st Division on the Peninsular and we all felt pleased at the idea of going into action. The Battalion was never very pleased with Heliopolis or Cairo after the novelty had worn off and the thought of being really in it made one feel pleased with things in general.\n\nThe 17th 18th and 19th Battalions left late in the day and the 20th, I think formed up to leave about 1a.m. We three Platoon officers packed everything and lay down to try and get a little sleep which I am afraid was a failure. We at length fell in and very carefully called the roll and made a minute inspection of each man. We moved out amid cheers and wishes of good luck\".\n\nNearly at the end of a hot and uninteresting march we met an officer on a motor cycle who said something about the train leaving later but it turned out it left soon after we entrained. The entrainment was made in good order and saw the men fixed up as well as possible in an Egyptian train.\n\nLeaving PALAIS-DE-KUBEIH railway station we tried to find room to put our packs. the Officers car was not much better than those used by the natives, it had electric lamps but we found that they would not light and so we had to use candles.\n\nWe passed through Cairo and shortly afterwards arrived at Alexandria wharf and embarked on the Saturnia. The old tub was packed with troops and the 19th Btn had already boarded. Everything was in a filthy dirty condition and the N.C.Os. had a bad time in regard to quarters until some were admitted to part of the Officers mess.\n\nTimes and dates\n\nLeft Helliopolis 11.30 pm","51":"\n\nArrived at Alexandria 7.30 am 16th\n\nLeft Alexandria 6.30 pm 16th\n\nOn the 17th life belt parade.\n\nArrived Lemnos harbour on \n\nThursday the","52":" at 5.30am\n\nAmmunition and iron rations issued.\n\nArrived Anzac 11.30 pm on 22nd\n\nLanded that night or early morning.\n\n We now go back to what happened on the transport Saturnia’. We had no idea how long the trip would last as they do not take the usual route, and only had a vague idea of our destination. The ship had only just arrived back from a trip to the Dardanelles, so the Captain of the ship informed me, and so had no time to refit.\n\nAugust continued. They could not even provide drinks for the Officers mess and the food was very short and it took a long time to get it served up. We did not complain as we had made up our minds to put up with anything that came along. I managed to get a cabin to myself opposite to the one occupied by Hoskins and Evans. The heat became oppressive and I much appreciated the extra freedom a 4 birth cabin allows for one occupant. We did not yet know what kind of an O.C. we had struck and wondered who was going to take charge of No 9 platoon and also who was going to be 2nd in Command of the company. The ship took on a lot of A.M.C. stores and ammunition which was afterwards issued to the men.\n\n At the wharf native, men and women came asking for backshis\" meaning money and some of the men pitched them money and soon their numbers increased. The native police in their red hats and blue uniform chased them away with a thick stick which they carry. It was quite hopeless as no sooner was one lot chased away than another lot would take their place. One old woman with a baby I remember particularly was most persistent and when she was hit with the stick she made a terrible fuss. I wondered why the wharf authorities did not complain to the O.C. Troops , I could not make out. The civil authority tried to stop with all their might just what the troops were encouraging.\n\nAlexandria was full of ships, and at least 6 Hospital ships could be seen and one came in while we were there. One or two Battleships were there, one being a French boat. We loaded two iron clad small boats, one on each side fore and aft. We all wanted to know what they were for, some said to clear the narrows of mines but of course they were only guessing. I remember little of the journey acRoss except that we had an armed guard on the boat deck each end and two machine guns ready to shoot at submarine if it appeared. It was certain that if we did get hit by a torpedo that half of us would be finished as the boats would not carry half the men, if they were seaworthy which was very doubtful.\n\n Boat drill alarm was held and each Officer had charge of a boat. All ranks had to wear a life belt, and also to carry it about with him for the remainder of the voyage. To be orderly officer on Saturnis was just about the worst job I have ever had, everything was so mixed up that it was impossible to get satisfaction of any sort. Lack of proper organisation and method would have caused great inconvenience had the voyage been longer. If we had been hit by a torpedo I am sure I do not know what would have happened and did not like to think about it.\n\nBy this time we had found out that we were to land near the Salt Lake, make a road and connect up with other troops. The Salt Lake is just to the right of Suvla Bay.\n\nAugust continued. 1915\n\nThe country was said to be very rough and so we had orders to put on breeches instead of shorts. This order was cancelled shortly after everyone had taken the trouble to get the breeches out of the packs and do them up again. This caused a considerable amount of grumbling. Some of the foolish men had thrown their shorts away. All ranks were issued with 200 rounds of ammunition and two days rations. Water was said to be very scarce and so we were ordered to fill all available tins with water ready to take off with us. No one appears to realise that water carried in open tins on a small boat and carried down ladders and over all kinds of obstacles will certainly be spilt. It was on this famous ship that I learnt to my horror that the sun rose in the south in the Northern Hemisphere. I hope this officer will soon find out his mistake or he may lead his Battalion in the opposite direction to the one required.\n","53":" We arrived at Lemnos, but land was first sighted at 6.45 on the 17th. The country was rocky with light barren soil, without any kind of vegetation except around small villages. Passed a burning mountain about 8 hours sail from Lemnos, the locality or name of which I do not know. As we entered Lemnos Harbour we counted 20 War ships, 10 Hospital ships, an over 100 other large steamers including transports. The Flag the Blue Ensign was raised as we passed the first War ship and all on board cheered. The flag was lowered after we passed. \n\nWe remained at anchor for three days and then changed over to another ship called the Osmaniah a small 20 knot boat, which before the war traded between Alexandria and Constantinople. She was fortunate to leave Turkish waters a day or so before war was declared. A dispute arose over the Officers mess. The English Officers managed to get a good meal served up to them and refused the Australian Officers admittance.\n\nBefore leaving Lemnos everyone managed to get a swim and some swam over to some of the other transports. The Staff Officer on the Osmaniah before the boat had hardly been made fast, called out through a megaphone The 19 Battalion and the number of men and officers, the 5th Field Ambulance will disembark on to the Osmaniah. The","54":" Btn will remain on board for the time being. The Osmaniah soon got going and we passed lines of Warships, French and British, and also many transports from all we received cheers with occasional signalling and waving of hats. The fast boat with her Greek crew made the water fly away from her stern and we expected to arrive at the Peninsular that night. Some of us lay down on deck to try and get a few hours sleep after making many trips round the ship to prevent smoking, or any kind of light.\n","55":" continued. I found the electric light full on in the wheel house and reported it to the Captain of the ship. Soon the guns could be heard in the distance and in a short time rifle fire, the flashes could be observed on the hills, there appeared to be a fight on. Shortly afterwards bullets began to fall on the deck, and a Greek standing on the bridge was hit in the stomach. A hospital ship loomed up and we anchored near to one of them and prepared to disembark. As usual everything was in a mess, no method and everyone in charge. The reserve of ammunition, medical stores, tools and etc had to be got off and it was found very difficult on the crowded ship and narrow passages on to the barges. A landing officer through his megaphone made a few attempts to prevent so much talking and to hurry us up with Will the officers in charge, kindly hurry them up\".\"Pack up close\" His English affected speech rather annoyed the Aussies. At last we came to a small low wharf at Anzac, and after some difficulty landed. The sea was a little rough and it was no easy matter to jump on to the wharf with full pack, 200 rounds of ammunition, and two days rations. On getting to the beach we made a rather uncertain march along the beach to a Gully which we afterwards found was called Rest Gully. It was a very hard pull up as it was very rough and steep. As soon as we were given the order to halt we lay down exhausted and attempted to go to sleep for a few hours till morning, it was then about 3 of the clock. Major JENKINS was in command of the Battalion as Colonel was taken ill and remained behind in hospital. At daybreak most of us got up and had a look round, some tea and bully beef and biscuits.\n","56":" Several men were wounded on the beach and 4 GHURKAS reached ARGYLE GULLY.

At midnight flares saved from Gallipoli were fired up into the air. The 5th,6th and 7th Brigades were camped near the harbour, the ground was undulating, exposed and stony. Fresh water was difficult to obtain. I was in B Company at the time and in charge of No 6 Platoon. Visited the small village of Condia. Population appears to be about two thousand. People of two distinct classes. The peasant class dress in sheepskins, baggy pantaloons, black hair, sallow complexion, slow deliberate, swinging walk and older men always carry sticks. \n\nThe better class have intellectual faces, and a quick brisk walk. Dress like Europeans. Police look very smart in their blue uniform, black leggings, silver buttons and braid. They come from the mainland.\n\nHouses built of stone and wood, two storeys. Cows particularly odd looking. All structures are in a simi-dilapited state. Cemeteries crude. A rough wall of stone painted white on top represents the boundary of the cemetery. Poor attempt at grave stones. Churches small, roughly ornamental, tower contains small bell, inside Similar to other churches, seats are of the old fashioned style.\n\nStreets narrow, paved with kidney stones. Sanitation bad. Water supply wells and springs. Windmills are seen in every direction. They have no carts. People polite and keen on business. Shops sell chocolate, oranges, figs, tin-fruit, cigarettes. English money taken. Animals donkeys, goats, chickens, camels, dogs, cats, sheep. Women draw water. Use plough made of wood which can be carries away on a donkey after use. They do not plough deeper than six inches. Products-figs, oranges, cabbages, dates and nuts.\n","141":" Orderly Officer. Trouble about the lights in the camp.

Still in the same spot.\n","145":" Bde Headquarters sailed in the Similar, the ship has a sea going torpedo boat for escort. The Islands which abound in this part are constantly patrolled by the Allied fleet. A concert was held in the Officers cabin, Sgt Mongomery played the piano and Pte Leeming the violin, these two provided most of the entertainment. All lights are put out at night in order to prevent any submarine from seeing the ship. The Lewis machine guns are mounted in order to use them against any suspicious object.\n\n The Manitouhas a 1909 pattern 12 pounder mounted on aft of the ship. This gun had been used 3 times against German torpedo boats, one of the German boats was chased by a British and went aground. A British Aux. Cruiser signalled\"follow me at 14 knots\". The Manitoucould not do this so she signalled back cannot do it to which the cruiser replied follow at best speed. The Manitoumanaged 13 knots.

His name is Mahmet Abhar Khan Chief of Hoti. Said to raise 10000 Indian recruits. Sea is rough. \n","147":" Nothing unusual has happened, we are expecting to arrive at Alexandria.\n","148":" Arrived Alexandria harbour at 1500, It was noticed that the water had changed to a much more pronounced blue. The harbour is large and covered with low breakwaters, the entrance is guarded with two small guns mounted in the lighthouse at the entrance to the breakwater.\n","149":" Anchored in the wharf. Men escaped from boat to Alexandria. The battleship anchored near (the Magnificent). Tommies on board.\n","150":" Disembarked and entrained for TEL el KEBIR. Left 3 p.m. arrived 10p.m. Country passed through, low and flat and highly cultivated. CRossed NILE twice. The peculiar cow ,water buffalo drew much attention. It is of a dark Brown colour, bony, and has a hump on the back and very little hair. Large number of natives employed in deepening irrigation channels as we passed through. The native villages are built of mud and wood, all clustered together. Very insanitary. Cows, donkeys, chickens and dogs live in the same houses.\n","151":" When we arrive at TEL el Kebir late at night we had to bivouac. Parade in the afternoon and then pitched a small number of tents.\n","152":" Ammunition handed in. Took N.C.O’s. class. One man per Company allowed leave to Cairo.

Molaska is about one mile from Ismalia. We commenced a very trying march on the desert, it rained and we could not reach our destination had to pitch tents enroute.\n","165":" The Officers Mess was opened in record time. The wind became strong and some of the tents were blown down. Marched out towards Australia Hill. We soon came to the end of the made road. The rest of the route lay over the desert. Stones were being carried by the camels to make the road. Long streams of these camels appearing at intervals on the crest of a hill. We at length arrived at Pinch Gut Gully in an exhausted condition, to add to our discomfort it commenced to rain and the camels carrying the tents had lost their way. The camels at length arrived and a number of tents were pitched in the dark.\n","166":" Our camp is situated on a slight rise in the desert. There is no vegetation to be seen anywhere. The canal and lake are just in view from Australia Hill which is close by. In places a kind of hard white clay can be dug up out of the sand. The roads are made from this. In places there are tufts of course grass which the camels appear to like. The camels, of which there are a large number, carry a load of five mounds equal to 400pounds, some carry more than this. The Officers stove was brought by one camel, which also had another box on the other side to balance it. It took 8 men to lift the camel up. Once on its feet it carried it five miles. The long swinging stride of the camel takes along at a pace of about 5 miles an hour. \n","167":" The 30th. Battalion are camped near Australia Hill. Lt. Wark is a 1st Lieut. in the 30th Btn. It rained heavily this morning. Weather is most uncertain. Half-holiday. Men are very discontented over the food. B.and C. Companies parade to, the Colonel over the matter.\n","168":" Starting musketry instruction. I shaved off my moustache which I have had ever since I have been on service.\n","169":" Party of Turks reported three miles away. Turks also reported sixty miles away signalling. The Battalion band parades.\n","170":" Sgt-Major Alexander becomes regimental S.M. Cpl. Brown is tried and let off for using obscene language. Sand bags were used to build huts and cook-houses. Just as these works were complete all sand bags were called in. The O.C. has drunk the Officers Mess dry. Weather changes and turns fine and hot. No sand storms yet. Mount Sinai or Mosesis not a great distance away. It is said to be 7000 feet high.\n","171":" to","172":" Lieut Rae goes to the machine Gun School. The Battalion 82 reinforcements, no Officers. Nothing of interest has taken place.\n","173":" Church Parade. Visited Ferry post. Took a photo of the camels loaded up with sick men.\n","174":" Nothing of interest takes place.\n","175":" Battalion changes camping ground. A\" and B\" Companies remain near Australia Hill C\"and D\" went to a place called Lithgow 1 ½ miles away.\n\nAn inquiry is commenced into the conduct and work of Lieut Rawlingson, he is charged with neglect and being drunk.\n","176":" A Company goes trench digging, the trenches are not far from the camp. The sand makes it very tedious work as the sand keeps falling in, they are dug out extra large to allow for this. 4feet 6 inches deep Traverse lift at base and 9 at top fire step 23 feet long. The 5th Australian engineers have the construction of these trenches in hand, they are not the original engineers who were on the Peninsular with us but they were formed in Aust. and have not long arrived.\n\nMail received and the Battalion was paid. Captain Ross is very funny when paying the men, some he sends back to have a shave others to have their hair cut.\n","177":" I have come to the conclusion that the bump of organisation is not highly developed in the Australian, the bump of pleasure is however very prominent. \n\nBeing Orderly Officer I was ordered out on a 3 hour parade at night. I am doing all the censoring. Received another mail. \n\nThe men are treated without the slightest consideration by the Officers, they do not appear to me to understand how they treat educated volunteer soldiers; for one thing the difference between familiarity and congeniality is unknown. Good fellowship does not exist between officer and men. The true idea of discipline is not understood by the Australian. Far too much criming goes on and at times the men are made criminals by the bad management they receive.\n\n Drill is never by any chance made progressive or interesting. Generally speaking they are worked too hard. The Officers cannot judge character, this refers particularly to the younger ones.\n","178":" Major Ross informs me that I am to be Captain and second in Command of A\" Company.\n","179":" Sent a remittance of 27 pounds, 17 pounds to Mother and Dad, to be given to Percy.\n","180":" Sand storm. Trench digging discontinued.\n","181":" Gambling, boxing is the chief means of amusement. Deviation of railway commenced. Drew maps of trenches. While the officers were at mess, some men called out loud enough for all in the mess to hear who is a bastard? Ross\". The cause of this was that a man had been ordered to carry a pack filled with sand, which caused him to collapse. \n\nSeventeen guns were left behind on Gallipoli, six French, and eleven British. Surplus ammunition was exploded by being fired at by the war ships. All the guns were successfully blown up.\n","182":" Out-post was placed in front of Australia Hill to intercept possible Turkish raiding party. An aeroplane circled round and round the camp and dropped a message stating that the camels carrying a party of Arabs had been fired on 10 miles away. Out-post caught Arab behaving suspiciously, saying that he wanted to go to the 9th Battalion and then had no mission.\n","183":" Raining heavily. It is rumoured that we are to go to France. Lt. Baily has been given the D.S.O. and Sgt. Brennan the D.C.M.\n","184":" Weather very unsettled, strong wind.\n","185":" Visited out-post. Five men reported five miles from HOG’S BACK making a reconnaissance. Light horse went out to investigate. It is considered possible that the Turks may make a raid. We hear the news of the fall of ERZEROUM. General Townsend is said to be in difficulties at KUTE-AMARATHE which is just the other side of Bagdad. Large Turkish patrol said to be in the neighbourhood.\n\n19th. General Legge reviews the Battalion and gives an address chiefly regarding discipline. He considers one man who misbehaves himself is a pro German and is equal to seven Germans owing to the trouble he causes and the guards which have to be mounted over him. He says that though they do not know it Australians are bashful about saluting. That English officers are reticent with regard to the Australian soldiers.\n\nGeneral Legge also mentioned that some Australian soldiers tried to cause damage to the trains by cutting the signal wires on the railway line a most outrageous and dastardly act. Being drunk is no excuse for committing crime. This is an amateur Army with all classes mixed and all trying to do their bit for their country.\n\n At Maltaan Italian lady was good enough to take Australian wounded soldiers out for drives in her motor, when she was forced to run away to avoid insult. There are few tyrannical Officers in our forces.\n\nWar Diary continued\n","186":" The question has been asked, is it safe to let Australian soldiers into Belgium would they be as bad as the Germans themselves?\n","187":" Church Parade. Weather dull, cold and windy.\n","188":" Two hundred mounted on camels reported fifteen miles away. A Turk tried to swim the canal but was caught. 3rd Brigade report a man three miles our acting in a suspicious manner. A Turkish reconnaissance in force may be expected. If this arrives by day they are to be resisted outside main line of defence. General Holmes is annoyed at the gay life the","189":" Battalion Officers have been living, and particularly dislikes gambling.\n","190":" Battalion comforts distributed. Three cases have been stolen in transit. Colonel Lamrockis most impartial in all his dealings. There are a large number of defaulters. The Cameroons have been captured. General Holmes, Colonel Wisdom, Major Viney and Lt. McCallum have dinner with us. A very fine menu is arranged. Major Viney remarks these Englishmen are no damn good\". Lt-Colonel O'Halloran is to be in charge of a training brigade.\n","191":" There is supposed to be a very strained relationship between U.S.A. and Germany. Colonel Lamrockwas the last Batallion Commander to leave the Peninsular. General Holmes was the last Divisional Commander. Captain Ross was the last to leave the trenches at RUSSEL’S TOP.\n","192":"\n","193":"\n","194":" Nothing of importance\n","195":" Lt. McCALL joins the Battalion.

Sub-Lieut. two Petty Officers and six sailors come to stay with the Battalion. Severe sand storm. Lt Hoskins promoted Captain. Cpl.Jenkins promoted to 2\/Lt.\n","198":" Visited out-post and got lost.\n","199":" Nothing\n","200":" Move from KANIMBLA VALLEY to FERRY POST WEST. A hard and fatiguing march as the men had full pack and blankets to carry.\n","201":" Left FERRY POST WEST 9am. The march through ISMALA was very tiring even the sight of the green foliage and habitation did not revive us. We continued to march for hours in the hot mid-day sun. En route we passed by various hospitals, among which was an Indian Hospital under the shade of the trees. A GHURKA stood guard with his drawn knife. Arrived at MOASKAR about 2 pm and very glad to find tents already pitched.\n","202":" Battalion marched to the lake for a swim, band leading. Every one inoculated including myself. A general Officers Mess meeting held. Major Paul moved that all spirituous liquors be cut out of the mess. Mess showed a profit of 46 pounds A lecture was given to the Officers on the use of gas helmets.\n","203":" Volunteers are asked for the Divisional Cyclist Corps. All clothes are fumigated.

Ismalia is a very pretty little town, at present full of military hospitals. Reported that there are drums there, and our men are said to line up, 30 deep and await their turn. The club is a very fine building and is thrown open by the people of Ismalia for the use of all Officers.\n","209":"\n","210":" Nothing\n","211":" Received marching orders. Corporal Murray is awarded 12 months imprisonment by Court-Martial. Tin box arrived from COOKS. Entrained at MOASKAR station 1700. All travelled in horse trucks.\n","212":" Arrived at wharf at 4.30 and boarded INGOMA. The INGOMA is the best troop-ship we have yet travelled on, tonnage 4000, speed 12 ½ knot. Stewards are Laskars. My cabin is No 20 on the starboard side. Spent a few hours in Alexandria and visited the museum and had dinner there. Alexandria is a fairly nice town as towns in EGYPT go. As is usual there are two distinct quarters, the European and the native. The European quarter is quite good and up to date; the native quarter is dirty and dilapidated. There are electric trams, garries, taxi cabs and motors. The streets are narrow. The museum is chiefly full of mummies and broken images.\n","213":" Left Alexandria at 1500 with a strong wind and a rough sea. At mess nearly every one had to leave owing to nature’s call. Men’s quarters in a fearful mess.\n","214":" Sea still rough.\n","215":" Band played on the boat deck.\n","216":"\n","217":" Expecting to arrive at Malta. Did not call at Malta. Turned off towards Cape BON. Passed within easy sight of the Island belonging to SICILY called PANTELLARIA, 45 square miles. A wireless message came through from the S.S. MINNEAPOLIS that a submarine has been sighted and later on the S.O.S. The MINNEAPOLIS was sunk at the same spot at which we were at 7 o’clock yesterday morning. Later in the day another wireless came through that a submarine had been sighted off VALETTA Island, which spot we also passed yesterday. Cape BON sighted at 4.30p.m. Can see the ruins of an old Moorish Castle. The famous town of CARTHAGE destroyed by the Romans can be seen in the distance. Am OFFICER of the watch and on duty from 10 to 2. Ship golf, forms the chief amusement. \n","218":" Sighted SARDINIA. Men medically examined.\n\n25th Arrived Marsailles. Marched through streets of Marsailles to the station. The march was a disgrace. Men straggled all over the place and officers did not appear to know the different traffic rules. The accommodation on the train is comfortable.\n","219":" We passed a place called ORANGE a town about the same size as ORANGE in N.S.Wales, we remained here ¾ of an hour and obtained something to eat. This was our first experience of the French way of serving up meals. This first days journey was very interesting to all and every one was struck by the beautiful scenery and the French girls with their high colour and good features. The strong smell of flowers also attracted much attention. The electric trains were a novelty to the Australians. German prisoners were working in different places in route; the men did not show any signs of hatred to them outwardly. \n\nThe bright green vegetation called forth much comment, some remarked this is a country worth fighting for\". At every place we passed the French people turned out to welcome us, their manner showed every good feeling and the Australians much appreciated this and showed their appreciation by cheering all the time. The train as is usual with troop trains was very slow.\n","220":" Passed through VERSEILLES, MARSEILLES,LYONS and within sight of PARIS. The boys turned out and asked for souvenirs from the Australians who freely gave them anything they had.\n","221":" Major Ross, Captain SINGLE, Lieut BYRNE and myself travelled down in one ordinary carriage and during the trip I had a heated argument with the Chaplain.\n","222":" Saw the palace of VERSEILLES in the distance and also PARIS in the distance. Arrived at the end of our journey and marched to our billets at STEENWORK.\n","223":" Went to BERTHEN Trench Mortar School and about nine miles away, travelled in motor buses and had a very interesting trip. Passed some of our own transport and as we were the first to arrive in FRANCE much enthusiasm was shown by both the transport men and ourselves. We were soon observed by the hats we were wearing. The troops passed on the way cheered and we all enjoyed the trip.\n","224":" Had mess with some English Artillery Officers at BERTHEN. Attended the school and found it very interesting. Weather cold. The firing can be heard from here and enemy TAUBES fly over at times.\n","225":" All the","226":" Bde officers think that the Trench Mortars are no good and so interest is not very keen.

The General was very business like and asked me no end of necessary questions, to which I was able to give satisfactory replies. The General said that he would see General Holmes to substantiate my statements, and if all was well he would transfer me. I called to see him the next morning at EQUINGHEM and he said that everything was alright,\"do you think that you could manage the Heavy Battery\" to which I replied yes\". He told me that I would have V 4 A Bty. And to put in my application for a transfer and he would sign it there and then. I went to SAILLY the next morning in the car to 4th Artillery Headquarters.

On taking over the","308":" Div. many of the Medium Trench Mortars were buried by shell fire. Our Artillery are continually shelling with guns from 18 pdrs. to 15 inch. In SAUSAGE GULLY the 16 pdrs. are practically in the open and only a few yards apart and they keep up an incessant bombardment.\n\nGerman dug-outs are exceedingly well built, anything from20 to40 feet deep, spacious and lighted with electric light. In some cases the steps are made in a zig-zag manner in order to prevent the possibility of bombs falling down. Divisional Artillery Headquarters are situated at a place called TARA HILL which was originally part of the French main line of defence and is shelled occasionally particularly at night.\n\n14thAugust Brought the remaining gun from Chalk Pitto billet. General NAIRNE sent for me and gave orders for the Heavy Gun to be fired between the hours of 6 and 7.30 p.m. Lt. Pinder Sgt-Maj. Wheeler and party left about 3 p.m. to prepare the gun for firing. Myself, Sgt. Russel-Davison and two men left later, after obtaining the special charges.\n\n We took the opportunity of riding as near the line as possible in a box car. The driver was game and so we went well in the danger zone with the car. Eventually after an exciting trip we arrived at the gun-pit. \n\nEnemy shell fire was intense. We found no one at the gun-pit, and quite expected that PINDER and his party had been blown out. Having overcome so many difficulties we found that we were unable to fire the gun owing to the absence of clinometer and prismatic compass, which Lt.PINDER and party had. The Bosche bombardment intense. \n\nWe waited half an hour in the hope that the others would turn up. Then Sgt. Davison went to try and obtain a clinometer, with instructions not to be away more than half an hour. In half an hours time two men turned up with a clinometer, and as Sgt. Davison had not returned in the time given him,\n\n I made an effort to align the gun by the row of trees which were marked on the map along the road leading to Mouquet Farm. After scrambling about for some time I found there was no line of the road or trees to be seen. I then went to Battalion Headquarters and was knocked over on the way and quite dazed. Arriving at the 50th Battalion Headquarters I was delighted and surprised at being able to obtain a prismatic compass.\n\n I then scrambled back to the gun-pit, and found that Sgt. Davison had returned. I then aligned the gun by compass, which entailed three things;-going some distance from the gun to avoid contact with the iron, to remove steel helmet, and to remain perfectly still in the open while Fritz was shelling. The lip of the pit had to be cut away and the men worked like Britons in the open, pushing the earth down into the pit. \n\nThe German bombardment rather increased in intensity. Three rounds only were fired. This does not sound much, but those who were there can realise what those three rounds meant. After firing the three rounds we left hurriedly, making a dash for the only remaining good sap which was about a quarter of a mile away.\n\nHaving arrived safely at the sap we all felt exceedingly thankful. Somehow I felt very weak in the knees and found difficulty in getting along. Sgt. Davison who was leading the way, commenced to roil about in an uncontrollable manner, and at length broke into a frantic rush, cursing and swearing at the Huns. He was apparently suffering from over strain, and the part of the trench from which we had on the way up thrown out one of our own men just killed, started Davison on his headlong career. He at length fell exhausted in the trench, and recovered sufficiently to be able to walk. His memory had gone, and we had difficulty in getting him along. He recognised me and said Is that you Capt. Fox. I will follow you to death, no one ever yet found Davison a coward\". We at length arrived at the junction of the trench and the road, where Davison would persist in sitting down and talking to a man who apparently just died on a stretcher.\n\nWe here found an infantry man who had lost his way and was demented. We brought him along with us. Davison again started a charge all on his own, charging down the road at full speed, fortunately in the right direction. He came acRoss some Tommy machine gunners whom he started to lash into, fortunately he was unarmed.\n\nWhen the others came up he set upon them as well, and gave one man a vigorous smack in the mouth. I rode ahead on a bicycle and obtained an ambulance wagon to take us all home to the billet. We were all considerably shaken and heartily glad to get back. Davison’s memory improved and he asked after Mr Pinder and party.\n","309":" General NAIRNE sent for me, as he was anxious to know how we got on. I did not feel at all well, but shaken up from the day previous. The General was very kind and thoughtful and expressed satisfaction at what had been done. I asked that Sgt. Davison’s work receive recognition. I returned to the billet and rested and went to bed early. I learnt that the attack which took place the previous night had failed, owing to the fact that the Germans attacked at the same time. The bombardment which was taking place while we were firing the gun was their preliminary to an attack.\n","310":" 1st. Div.

I observed three shots the third of which went right into Mouquet Farm. The burst of the 240mm shell can be distinguished from all other bursts by its greater height and the tremendous amount of earth and stones it throws up. I then returned to the gun and we fired 5 more rounds, when we received a note stating that some of our shells were falling near our infantry trenches. The concussion from the gun, when fired is tremendous, in a covered in pit or dug-out. The place is filled with dust, the ground shakes and large pieces fall from the walls. This was the first time that we had used the No 31\/24 D.A. fuse. It was successful. The Huns were putting a few shells over but there was no intense bombardment. Our infantry made an attack at 6 p.m. and gained their objective.\n\n DAILY MAIL report- Gradually the British troops are pushing nearer to Theipvalle. In LEIPZIG SALIENT yesterday they advanced to within a thousand yards of the town, while near Pozieres they made considerable progress, advancing on a front of half a mile and establishing themselves just outside Mouquet Farm which is almost due east of Theipvalle and overlooks it.

There were two Stokes Guns in the position and a large quantity of ammunition stacked in an unsafe position, the cap end of the cartridge facing the enemy. \n\nWe returned and visited the heavy gun pit. They have made the KAY DUMP within a few yards of the pit, connecting it by a tram line. We obtained our bicycles from the engineers dump at FRITZ’S WELL and returned. I had a clean up and then went to see the C.R.A. with regard to the possibility of placing the gun in the Quarry. I came back and gave instructions to Y4A Battery to get one gun and 15 rounds into the Quarry. X4A Battery had instructions to fire one gun from their position, but when they got up there they found that everything had been buried.

Owing chiefly to L.E. mechanisms getting out of order and one of the beds giving out it was found that the 100 rounds could only be fired from one gun.

Artillery surprisingly quiet. Stokes and M.G. co-operation good throughout. Enemy Mortar, thought to fire shells about 12 to 15lbs. from smooth bore, range at least 800 to 1000 yds. came into operation towards end dropping 40 or 50 shells along OLD KENT ROAD. They appeared to have delay fuze but did little damage. In addition to torpedoes and rum-jars, the enemy used the original rum-jar. \n\nWar Diary continued\n\nY4A Bty. Covered HOLLANDSCHESCHUUR SALLIANT,BOIS QUARRANTE,SUNKEN ROAD SALIANT and CROONAERT CHAPELLE. Front line, supports and communications were systematically strafed. Much material observed to be displaced, duck boards, wire and ravetting. Much trouble encounter with rifle mechanisms. Cpl. BLAKE particularly commended for firing greatest number of rounds in spite of having to remove rifle mechanism at least six times. Mechanism eventually burst also clamping band. Retaliation consisted of a feeble volley of rum-jars and a few rifle grenades.\n\nAmmunition expended as follows:-\n\nNo 1 70 rounds\n\nNo 2 66 rounds\n\nNo 3 56 rounds\n\n No 4 58 rounds\n\nZ4A Bty.No 1 and 2 guns on PICADILLY FARM, Front line and supports.\n\nOne round from No 2 gun fell just out of the mortar and fortunately failed to explode. This was put down to faulty cordites. No 3 gun fired on F.L.T., supports and wire. Trouble experienced with four joints of extension frame and the gun overheating. Enemy mortar retaliation damaged parapet of No 1 gun. Several 5.9s fell in the rear of the pits doing no damage. \n\nAmmunition expended as follows:-\n\n No 1 gun 31 rounds\n\nNo 2 gun 60 rounds\n\nNo 3 gun 56 rounds\n\nNo 4 gun 70 rounds\n\nV4A Bty. Very careful preparations had been made for the registration of the heavy gun on RUINED FARM. The mortar was trained on the Farm at a range of 1000 yards, 200 yards more than the actual range, to obviate the possibility of a short round falling in our own trenches. The barrel was cleaned, sponged and warmed. The first round was observed by Captn.Sherwood to fall about 15 yards from the pit, and did not explode. The second round travelled about 450 yds. And was likewise a dud. Fourth round just reached German front line (600) yds. and detonation was observed to be perfect. Fifth round was a repetition of the fourth. Sixth and seventh rounds dropped 600 and 300 yards short of the point aimed at. As all these rounds were fired at the same range and elevation, Captn.Sherwood considered it unwise to expend further ammunition and therefore ceased firing at 3.30 p.m. The erratic shooting was considered due to defective charges. It afforded great satisfaction to those who had spent so much time and labour on construction of the pit, to know that the bed proved in every way satisfactory. \n\nThe failure of the heavy guns to prove satisfactory was most annoying but the same thing was experienced by the 47th Division who had relieved us on the BLUFF front and again in a few days time the firing of the gun was stopped from Headquarters.\n\n I made arrangement for another stunt straight away. The Battery Commanders had done very well and they soon managed to get up more ammunition with authorised help of the Infantry. \n\nHerewith a report on the second operation:-\n\nBattery X4A.

A field clinometer was used with this gun. Great damage was done all along the line to enemy trenches and wire at 0.4.a.5.51\/2, the enemy front line is breeched for 30 yards and the support line for 10 yards.\n\nThe bombs fired from No 4 gun threw up timber, wire bags and etc. The damage was far in excess of the expectations of Lieut. ANDERSON the Battery commander.\n\nEnemy Artillery retaliation was very feeble except on the craters where he put over numerous whiz bangs. Enemy Mortar retaliation was heavy, particularly on ESTAMINET LANE and OLD KENT ROAD. ESTAMINATE LANE was blown by torpedoes for about 20 yards. Several enemy torpedoes air burst occurred. No casualties to personnel. The battery commander reports that his men worked in excellent fashion and hopes that they have carried off the championship from the other T.M.

Sgt STAFFORD observed.\n\nNo2 gun:- during the firing of this gun one charge ignited as soon as it was placed in the piece, owing to the overheating of the gun and scorched one of the men’s eyes. This caused a delay of 10 minutes. The bed gave trouble near the finish and it had at least 14 inches of play lengthwise. A heavy minenwerfer operated around the gun firing 12 rounds.\n\n2\/Lt BARRON observed.\n\nNo3 gun:- on firing the","354":" round the rifle mechanism blew out. All that could be found of it being splinters of wood. The thread of the piece was damaged and firing had to be discontinued. Shrapnel was fired at this gun.\n\n Lt.Hirst observed\n\n No 4 gun:- Surplus ammunition from No3 gun was transferred to this gun. Rifle bouts had to be exchanged several times. This gun was in a new and well constructed emplacement and had the only Newton bed in the Brigade. Without this bed the result of 125 rounds fired in 59 minutes could not have been obtained. Retaliation consisted of fishtails on supports and field guns on CHICORY LANE, fifty yards of which was badly damaged. The rate of fire caused an almost constant ascent and decent of debris in the enemy territory.\n\nThe time that the gun was firing was checked by Lt Hirst who was observing.\n\nTargets engaged were: Wire F.L.T. and supports on HOLLANDSCHES-CHUUR SALIENT. Wire at N12d02. Wire and trench at 07c63, supports with T.M. positions at 07c59 and 07c61\/291\/2, and front line wire at 07b65to 22.\n\nRetaliation- 35 rounds from two heavy mortars falling to right of POPPY LANE. 80 rounds from small T.M.(fishtails) on POPPY LANE and around the four positions.\n\nNo 1gun Cpl. Young 40 rounds\n\nNo 2 gun Bdr. Brooks 7 rounds\n\nNo 3 gun Cpl. Blake 125 rounds No 4 gun Cpl. Beck 78 rounds\n\nAverage per gun 61 rounds.\n\nZ4A Battery operated on Craters, PICADILLY FARM and wire. No 1 gun in charge of Bdr. Dawson fired 102 rounds in 55 minutes, at which stage ammunition was expended. This gun was worked from an open spot and retaliation was severe. No 2 and 3 guns were\n\nOccupied on craters and considerably damage appeared to have been done, according to the quantity of material dislodged. Unfortunately a short round from this gun which fell only eight yards from the gun and exploded caused the death of Gnr. Vogel. \n\nThis sad circumstance, cast a shadow over the shoot.\n\nNo 4 gun fired 54 rounds and the emplacement was wrecked by the continuous firing and the water-logged condition of the ground. The mud splashing up over the gun each time the gun was fired.\n\nNo 1 gun Bdr. Dawson 102 rounds\n\nNo2 gun Bdr. Smith 34 rounds\n\nNo 3 gun Cpl. Sutton 54 rounds\n\nNO 4 gun Sgt. Conkey 45 rounds\n\nAverage per gun 58 rounds\n\nCasualties:- 10590 Gnr. Vogal killed\n\nWar Diary continued\n\n|The D.T.M.O. of the 41st Div took over on the","355":" and we then went to VICTORIA CAMP near RENINGHELST and with great difficulty in obtaining accommodation. The Town Major told us that we could have what the British Cyclist Corps did not want, the idea being that the Australians could have what the British did not want.\n\nOn the","356":" we left VICTORIA CAMP travelling in 10 motor lorries of the","357":" Aust. S.A.P. At ABELLE we joined the rest of the Park. The convey consisted of 44 lorries. We travelled south all that day passing through STEENVOORDE, HAZEBROUCK,LILLERS, RERNES, ST POL, FREVENT and to BOUQUEMAISON at which point we stayed the night, after having great difficulty in obtaining billets for the men and myself, but none for the other officers. Next morning we resumed our journey at 8 o’clock and passed through Doullens, BEAUVAL, TALMAS, ARMIENS and thence to Albert leaving the remainder of the lorries parked en route. I reported to Anzac Headquarters and was instructed to go to BELLEVUE CAMP. Arriving there after dark we found insufficient accommodation for the men and very poor accommodation for the Officers. I slept in a tent. Bellevue Camp we found to be an example of perfect organisation (I don’t think). Infantry arrived there when there was no accommodation and not possessing any blankets, and had to sleep out in the open. The weather was very cold on the journey and is very cold still. The next day I went out and tried to find Div. H. Qrs. and found they were at POMIER’S REDOUBT just past MAMETX WOOD to which place I got by walking and riding on motor lorries. Roads and surrounding country in a fearfully boggy state. I reported the condition of BELLEVUE CAMP to General COX and asked to be removed elsewhere. The General promised to do what he could and ordered a report on BELLEVUE CAMP to be sent in. On the second day in Bellevue Camp we got up to find there had been a light fall of snow during the night. Obtained billets in Albert from the Town Major, and moved into them and found them very much more comfortable than the sheds, and also we had not to supply fatigues to the Camp Commandant. I obtained my two horses from D.A.C. after much argument. The Batteries were distributed among the D.A.C. and F.A. Brigades for duty. Lt.Anderson goes on leave and Lt. Pinder goes to hospital. General GLASFORD killed in sunken road near GUEUDECOURT. Went to AMIENS and got a petrol lamp. \n","358":" detailed Lt. Hirst and two other ranks to instruct at Corps T.M.school. Fritz is shelling Albert occasionally, and yesterday killed two men who were going on leave, at the railway station. He also hit the hospital and tore up a bit of the railway line.\n","359":" Bdr DAWSON T.E., Gnr PENDLETON F., Gnr MARTIN G.F.W. have been killed while working on a railway line at the","360":" Bde and Gnr BUDGE W.H., Gnr DENNY W.E., are wounded.\n\nOne officer and 18 other ranks from D.A.C. are at Albert awaiting to proceed to CORPS Trench Mortar school at FREMONT which is under the Command of Captain Brown D.T.M.O. of the 1st Division. Lt Hirst and Sgt STAFFORD and Cpt Selby.\n","361":" (Cpl Selby) are going as instructors.\n","362":" Lt. Hirst, Sgt Stafford, Cpl Selby and one officer and nine other ranks from D.A.C. left by motor lorry for T.M.School at FREMONT Mr Lloyd George premier. Hill 304 at Verdun retaken by Germans.\n","363":" Made arrangements to move up to live at C.R.A French report having retaken HILL 304 from the Huns.\n","364":" Moved to Headquarters in the morning and attempted to make ourselves comfortable. The condition of the ground is such that it is impossible to keep ones feet dry and clean. It has been raining off and on all day.\n\nThe Huns made a raid last night with aeroplanes and dropped a few bombs, damage unknown.\n","365":" Proposed new was council, Lloyd George,Henderson,Carson,Bonar Law. Seven disabled Tanks in the neighbourhood of Flers and Guedecourt. \n","366":" Visited Trench Mortar School at FREMONT. Also NAQURS,AMIENS at latter place we had lunch. The KAISER informs his army that he has actually proposed terms of peace, but in the statement of the REICHSTAG, which was also made in VIENNA, SOLIA, and CONSTANTINOPLE, Bethmann-Hollweg only said that Germany was ready to negotiate with a threat that if the Allies do not listen, worse horrors would be let loose on the world. The cause of the German peace trick are clear, the German losses on the SOMME, put officially by the French at 700,000 (it is known that they have been surrendering pretty freely lately) their other losses, and their peoples empty stomachs.\n\n14\/12\/16 FRITZ put over about 12 shells into POMMIES REDOUBT, they did not do any damage but it was distinctly uncomfortable. The size of the shells is unknown some say that they were 9-4 inches and others that they were","367":" It is supposed they came a distance of 16 miles, a good many of them were duds and one of them they are digging for and find that it is down about 16 feet. Received a report that Sgt STAFFORD and Cpl Selby are inefficient as instructors.\n","368":" I go to Albert and MAULTE on the way to Mericourt but was taken ill on the way and had to return and recover at the billet in Albert . Peace talks still continue.\n","369":" Went to Albert an sorted out 2 complete 2 inch guns to go to the Trench Mortar School at FREMONT. The French have captured 9000 prisoners and 81 guns near Verdun.\n\nCommenced the duties of Staff Captain so as to be ready to take the place of Captain Forrest while he is on leave. I am very comfortable at Headquarters and think I shall like it better than being with the Battery Officers.\n","370":" Nothing\n","371":" Visited front line on front of Flers in company of General Rosenthal. Flers is nothing else than a mass of ruins. We have two Batteries of 18 pdrs. In Flers. The country is undulating and bespattered with shell holes. Two tanks,(male and female) are stuck on the main road between Flers and Ligny-Thilloy and about a quarter of a mile from Flers. The Hun can see them and shell them. There are a great number of dead mules about Flers.\n","372":" The Staff captain went on leave, and I took over his duties.\n","373":" Again visited the line in company of the General. When we arrived on the right of Guedencourt the enemy commenced shelling with 5.9s. Some pieces of a shell flew past us and the General was hit in the right thigh. He was able to walk and insisted on going on although there was still considerable shelling and some were coming unpleasantly near. \n\nAlthough we got within a hundred yards of the front line trench there were no communication trenches leading up to it . An enemy aeroplane flew not more than a hundred feet from us and directly over us. The pilot was easily distinguishable and we all stood and gazed at it in surprise. There are a great number of dead in front of Guedencourt not yet buried. The country is undulating and many good places for battery positions were found.\n\n We returned to Bernafay Wood after a fatiguing walk of about twelve miles. The General’s wound having been properly dressed we returned in an ambulance wagon. The medical officer who attended to the General’s wound was the very same one who first attended to his wound on Gallipoli. The General also had the same pair of breeches on that he was wounded in then. Met General Holmes on the return journey and also Cpt Norman\n\nSgt Crook came to Pommiers and I met him in the C.R.Es hut and lent him one of the horses to go and find the 4 Battalilon. The General went down to an ambulance to have a piece taken out of his leg and did not return. He will be back on Friday it is expected. The General is a man of wonderful energy quite fearless and keen on his work. A little action like this serves to illustrate what kind of man he is When walking on the duckboards where there is not room to pass the General id he sees that a man has his pack on will get off the duckboards himself and let them go on in spite of mud etc and in the case in point when he had a bad leg.\"\n","374":" Nothing of importance has taken place\n","375":" Nothing of importance has taken place. The General has returned from the Hospital\n","376":" I am finding the work a little trying and heaps to do. The Brigade Major and myself will not agree, I am very much afraid he is inclined to be snobbish and arrogant but it may only be his peculiar manner. The A.D.C.2\/Lieut Halford seems a decent chap but is at present new to his job. He is as far as I can gather an artist or a teacher of art and an Englishman.\n","377":" again and it passes the same as any other day and work of course continues the same. Went down to Albert and also to the 14th A.S.C. to arrange for a supply of wood for Xmas day.\n","378":" This being Xmas day it recalls the last Xmas day which I spent on the Island of Mudros after the evacuation. At 11.30 am the Left Group0 of the Anzac Artillery gave the Hun 2 minutes gun fire as a Christmas box, the Heavies gave the quantities of iron rations earlier in the morning. The weather is beastly raining, blowing and generally miserable. We had a very good dinner of turkey and etc but I was not very bright as I had a bad turn in the morning through eating fish I think.\n\nCaptain Style an expert horse master came, his job is as far as anyone knows to see to the horses and that care is taken of them, but he has not been out here before it does not seem to me much good sending him as he cannot understand the conditions under which they exist at present. The poor horses have as bad a time as anyone, the mud and the cold cause a very heavy mortality. \n\nThe N.C.Os and men on Headquarters have arranged a nice dinner with champagne and other wines. The General went to see how they were getting on, they drunk his health.\n\n"}}
