notes yesterday with Photos of Turkish Officers etc., - enclosed. Rough night & No. 1 Pier & a Steam Trawler are wrecked just like Anzac over again. Our efforts always seem so puny against the Sea – am Prosecutor on a Court Martial today.\n\nWeather cleared up & we have a sunny New Years Day.\n\nEvening, 3 planes bombed Al Arish while Court sat. Some men stand up & try & photo, but I’ll admit if I hear the bomb coming through the air I like to lie down – but in the sand bombs are more demoralizing than effective. DUST STORM blowing tonight everything sand, & the Horses move & are reformed.\n","2":"\n\nBig Khamsin last night & sand dunes are formed & others blown away. \n\nSome Scotchmen I knew in the King’s own Scottish Borderers came over & gave me a bottle of Whiskey for New Year celebrations. We sat on the edge of our bunkers and drank it with sand. Sand better than mud tho’.\n\n I note dear old Day is sending me new Bed Soks – I am still wearing the ones she made me last year, quite good. Big mail in – Letters from Mother, Joe & Day., redirected from England & also one to catch me here. Many people wrote, some sent Xmas cards!! a silly idea, to a man in the Desert in the Wet. I hope Mother you will go to Melbourne soon & get out of the heat, with Day.\n","3":"\n\nStill cold & wet. I have plenty of Kit if a man can carry it that is the trouble.\n\nWe are off again on another stunt in 12 hours – but hear the infantry are to be given a chance of some fighting this time.\n\nTwo A.S.C. men were killed by bombs yesterday. My house of Bags, oil sheet & blankets lets in the wet but I don’t take off any clothing you may be sure & we had a Rum issue last night.\n\n Aunt Louise wrote, & so many others it is good of them but I can’t possibly answer all.\n\nI get a lot of writing as Adjutant, apart from letters. Have just had a long yarn with Jim Ayre, he wishes to be remembered to you all.\n","4":"\n\n Dorothy does not sing or play but she can SKATE, DANCE, & play HOCKEY, eat, never sick, & is as strong as a horse quite ready to come into the Bush with me, she is not too happy at home I am afraid Father & Mother don’t get on well together. Of course she will love you little Mother & it will be a great day when I come home!!! Just wrote some letters.\n\nIt is still cold wet & raining. 2 Scotchmen dug themselves a Bivy in the sand and last night it fell in & smothered one, the other is in Hospital. We expect to go on a stunt tonight again – it will be cold, but no mud & am very fit & well. \n\nJim is thin but well - & we talked HAY till late.\n","5":"\n\nEl Arish\n\nThe Railway will be here today – wonderfully quick work considering the weather. Stunt postponed owing to RAIN – Rail made 1 & ½ KILO per day.\n\n Health of men not too good. Barcoo Rot very prevalent owing to poor Tucker.\n\nVery lousy camp this owing to Turks& Bedouins being here so long. Food is the great trouble here. 2 lbs per man of green stuff & often not that is allowed, so the men ride miles for a few Bushes etc. to cook with. This is a poor Country & the Bedouins are starving. They sift the horse manure for the few grains to be got out of it.\n","6":"\n\nEl Arish\n\nStill raining one gets nearly dry by midday only to get wet at night. The country here is better than nearer the Canal, 1000s of acres of wheat have been planted in the Sand & Fig Trees are everywhere.\n\nWell water can be got at about 12 feet & pretty good at that. No grass only edible bush that camels graze on. My notes are scribbled in all places & bear their gypsy begetting, but if they are of interest to you & afire others I am well repaid.\n\nHad a wash in the sea – cold - 1000s of Gypsy \nEgyptians I suppose\n labourers are building the Railway & the Station is just being formed. 1st TRAIN tomorrow.\n","7":"\n\nFine & warm again. Mule watching an enemy plane flying over – a big mob of PELICANS came along in their usual PHALANX formation & as one wag \nsays\n said \"the Orderly Sergeant behind to see they keep their \"dressing & don’t fall out\". Very few game birds here except a few ducks & plover.\n\n Parcel from Selfridges sent by Lance - I have been very lucky of late in receiving letters & parcels.\n\nBrigadier inspected lines always know Sunday by his visits.\n\nChurch Parade – Padres could tell us a lot of interesting stuff about this Country if they knew. Am sorry to see by Papers \"Carbinder\" is dead – I rode GUNSHOT at Romani a good horse.\n","8":"\n\nReal Riverina winter’s day.\n\nBombed during day – 22 Killed, 15 wounded out of Egyptian Labor Corps & a few horses – 2 L.H. At 9 o’clock last night 4 TAUBES came over in the moonlight & dropped 40 odd bombs & played their machine guns on us. I don’t know results yet but they rattled about our Bivouacs & \nyet we are told we have the supreme say in the air.\n Uncanny at night one Officer called out LIE down & inadvertently dropped into a Bucket of Water.\n\nGoing out tonight on our postponed Stunt, should be a good scrap.\n\nA Bedouin Dog stole our Bacon, that is worse or as bad as a Taube. \nBivouaced at Sheik Zowabin.\n","9":"\n\nOn Frontier.\n\nDivisional Hd. Qts. were quite surprised that no Funk Holes were made in their Brigade to get into when being Bombed. As John Thorpe has written our men turn round, & \"call the Bomb a Bastard\" and then go on with their work.\n\nLeft Sheik Zowabin at midnight & attacked Rafa 1st L.H. in advance, after riding all night we were not too fresh but our boys kept up their tradition & after a long day’s fighting we captured the position by 5 o’clock together with 4 guns 2 machine guns & all personnel & Slova.\n\nThe N.Z.M.R. we must admit did the ‘best’ job, getting the main redoubt.\n\n Our Casualties 2 Officers wounded 4 men killed 28 wounded.\n","10":"\n\nRafa.\n\nMy mate Major \nIrwin\n is shot through the arm – this time I escaped. Without doubt the ANZAC Mtd. Division are a fine lot of men – we bivouaced last night at Sheik Zowabin for 3 hours to rest & then got back to El Risa with PRISONERS. I & Major O’B & another had \na bottle FIZZ\n on our return presented (& kept for the occasion) by our Merchant in Port Said. After tendering Returns to B.H.Q. I shall sleep tonight.\n\nMy cob did well on Bedouin wheat, but had no drink for 36 hours!!! Among Turkswe got several German Staff Officers but missed General \nVON\n - I took a Belt off a Turk & will get the BUCKLE silver plated \nfor Dolly\n. All ranks feel well pleased with their work & themselves altho’ we’ve lost a few good men.\n","11":"\n\nEl Risa\n\n\"Pow Wow\" at B.H.Q. re our action – General \nChauvel\n rode alongside coming home & said \"The boys did well\" a little courteousness & thanks go a long way when all a mans nerves are on edge & he’s dog-tired.\n\nWe brought in a number of Bedouin & their Camels along with Turkish prisoners. Prisoners were fat & fit. What I have told you is only a part of proceedings. The 1, 2, 3 Regts. & N.Z.M.R. were all in it with Tommy Batteries of 8 guns. Will give you more particulars later, busy reorganising. 5th Mtd. Brigade of Yeomanry were on one flank & got badly cut up. Gloucesters Warwicks & Worcestershire brids. did well & many died gallantly.\n","12":"\n\n Posted an old Pay Book & some photos to you today.\n\nA few wounded have died. I’ll give you more particulars later on. We had no time to get anything except Rifles as Turkish Reinforcements are all coming up & we were 20 miles from food & water & first dark, so we collected our Prisoners & guns & got 1470 Prisoners counted 120 Prisoners wounded 200 buried in field & left behind. 1790. Bombed again today & the broken shells from our Anti Aircraft fell around us. Our BUS always arrives too late & we have not the supremacy of the air here YET.\n","13":"\n\nHear a mail is in. Still getting a few Turksby our Patrols. Had the Turksused Barb wire at Maghdabad Rafa we would not have done so well. We are not amused BOSH on my neck – fancy as soon as a man gets on the Desert these things start.\n\nI have been given a good book found at Maghaba – \tGreen Mantle by John Buchanan . You should try & get it.\n\nTried to sleep on a Turkish Officers Stretcher last night but found I did better on the sand. Some of the Turkshave Medals that were given them for their Desert March to Romani!!! in Aug. these things will \nsell\n for 20\/-.\n","14":"\n\nThat is proved by the way our men behave when they get the Trenches they do not go on Killing. One German Officer kept firing after the White Flag was put up – he was Court Martialled today & shot.\n\n Scotties are now up with us & one chap said \"This is El Arish! & alls ‘ell out this way.\" A good mail from England has been lost at sea so I’ll miss the wifes & Lauras.\n\nEnemy planes over again.\n\n All mails between Dec. 18th & 23rd December from England are Lost. I received tonight 2 from Mother 1 JOE 1 Desborough 1 Strong 1 1 Mrs Page 11 arrived. All DEC. 10th.\n","15":"\n\nTurned out last night to chase some enemy Cavalry but did not do any good.\n\nPadre previous night roused me saying enemy were coming over the hill he was very excited & made me run out. I saw only \nBUSHES\n!!! he had been saying his Rosary away by himself & fancied he saw things.\n\nWe now have Tents & I share one with R.C. Padre. You will have my letters acknowledging PARCELS long ere this & I am writing with your pen.\n\nI was amused to see among some gifts from the Victorian Racing Club some bottles of Blue Ointment. \nAll my love.\n","16":"\n\nI got the Goggles please thank \nJOE\n, posted notes yesterday. Papers Australasian Nov. 25 & Local Papers also came today many thanks. Got a Septic Gland in my neck now like a hungry jaw bullock but will soon be O.K.\n\n The wife is making great preparations for Australia her Mother is giving her a lot of Home advice etc. I tell her don’t bring too much as I’m sure she will be happy, having many friends among all classes.\n\nSo many of our Ranks have Septic Sores like Barcoo Rot. I suppose it is the want of Vegetables. We had the same at times away in the Back country but not so bad as this.\n","17":"\n\nWeather getting warmer now, soon hot weather again. Another mine blown up on Beach. A little more peace from bombs last day or two. Our Airmen dropped a message in \nBeersheba\n to say for every Bomb the Turksdropped we would drop 5. My mind keeps thinking over the collection of worms at a spot on the Road at Rafa – so like a lot of Rabbits after you have cleaned a PIT out some jumping about others lying quite still. I’m quite used to such sights & they do not affect me now I am glad to say.\n","18":"\n\nMen by Troops go to the Beach & are \nDeloused\n!!! by the Army Medical detail. PANTS turned inside out brushed with Horse brush & powdered. My Face is like the fat boy from Manly gone Septic but soon alright.\n\nSurf here not too safe. A Doctor was drowned yesterday & several Tommies. Nearly 2 years since I landed in Egypt first.\n\n Much GRAFT exists in the way of Promotions & Decorations & I am satisfied unless a man has someone behind him either wealthy or influential he sees not much chance altho’ the Army is supposed to be so very democratic now. The Democrat dearly loves a .\n","19":"\n\n I send you with this a letter from Major Irwin written from Hos – gives an idea of what he did. Sorry love I tore it. Jim Ayre came & had a long yarn last night hope you can read this can hardly see for a septic gland swelling Face up but soon all right it is the continual TIN stuff & no vegetables I suppose. Old Camping areas, etc. etc. Jim Ayre tells me Mrs. McFarland is an Anti conscriptionist & voted NO & some of her sons have volunteered.!!!\n\nWe have many Natives from Egypt building Barb wire & entrenching, but unless they can see one of our planes in the air they down tools & run away very afraid of bombs.\n","20":"\n\nRegiment gone on Reconnaissance, & stayed in the first time on record. I’ve missed a Stunt for sickness but gland not too good, making use of time to write some letters, have posted you a Gippy paper re Rafa. I hope you & Day & Dot are now out of the heat for a bit, & change is very necessary & don’t worry about me, I’m alright & will soon be marching home again I hope. Did I tell you the simple way the gunners hide their guns from enemy aircraft – simply a nett like a Tennis net or what I had over the fruit trees at M. Any distance up quite a blank & so light & easy to carry.\n","21":"\n\nRegiment staying out at the Bivy & the rest may go out tonight. Just got letters from Mother l5\/11\/16 & Joe enclosing Diary 12\/11\/16 Diary – been to England & back, I don’t think we missed many.\n\nVery sorry poor little Blackie is dead – I know what a dog’s affection is worth. Re Bulletin Pars re self – there \nwon’t be\n any PRAM coming home with Dolly & I! Will post this as I never like risking losing or anyone finding my Diary on me.\n\n28 Turksjust be sent in by Regiment. The Bedouins kill them if they get stragglers or deserters. I suppose they would us too.\n","22":"\n\nI have about 160\/-\/- in Bank in England. \n\nI have about 293\/-\/- Anglo Egyptian Bank Cairo \n\n 453\/-\/-.\n\nMy deferred pay 100 about\n\n £555\/-\/-\n\nHow much is in Savings Bank in Deniliquin please! Interest could be entered in Pass Bk. if you have it.\n\nKhamsin blowing – odd Turkscome in they know we will treat them decently & not feed the vultures on them like they do the Armenians, some terrible stories are told of what they have been doing to these unfortunate people.\n\nOne Turk had 2 bullets in him, shot by the Bedouins who got a lot of Rifles etc. from Rafa & Magdaba.\n\nTuesday 23 January 1917\n\nWet cold night again, my trouble better but face still like a Pie Melon.\n\nScotties have taken over our outpost line once more further out. We have always been in the front line. I could not help notice how clean the Turkscamps are, far better than ours – I suppose the discipline of the Germans do it – Even Al Arish when they cleared out was left perfectly clean.\n\nGeneral Chauvel our Divisional Commander has been Knighted. We are all pleased at sound recognition, & no doubt he deserves it. Col. Meredith got his D.S.O.\n\nIf Day sent me a Khaki Tie some time ago am afraid it never arrived, I can buy one in Cairo now, many thanks.\n\nWednesday, 24 January 1917\n\nFine weather at last & we move on to \nEl Burj, Col. Meredith\n has been given 4th Brigade & he wants me to go as Staff Captain - \nMy chance of a majority here is possibly good but\n I’ll go if sent for but it means leaving the old 1st L.H. Near here the Syrians are starving & the Bedouins are out to robb & kill friend or foe, I mean Turk or English. Poor Armenians have been killed & starved to death in 1000s.\n","23":" enemy planes bombed us but our Archies bombed them, one horse hit by empty shell from Archie. These fall all around us from above \nafter missing the enemy\n.\n","24":"\n\nMoved out to \nEl Burj\n & took over Command of B Squadron the old Squadron I had on the Peninsular \nas the late Major has been sent back for a mistake he made.\n\n I am in Order as a Tempy. MAJOR at last, so am not keen to go to Col. Meredith now.\n\nHowever we will see, but I’ll wear a Crown while I’m here any way. Received letter from home – Wife & Mrs. Ferran also Papers.\n\nDon’t put much in Papers about my majority till I tell you it is in Orders, it takes time to come back from the Base.\n","25":"\n\nJust handled 2 Turkswho \ntook\n gave themselves up – I lifted the Cap of one & found he was simply crawling, one man may be lousy, but not like those fellows. They say at \nSaliel\n about 25 miles on there are 3000 Turks, 4 Guns & 23 machine guns & no wire entanglements so its not a bad job ahead.\n\nJim Ayre is in my tent doing the Cash Books. Re LICE – The DELOUSING machines we have are German ones captured from the Turksat Magdaba, so they know the curse in spreading disease. Glad to hear Charlie Tyson has the Military \nCross\n Medal. Must write him.\n\nSaturday 27 January 1917\n\nThis is the Squadron I had on the Peninsular the 2nd time I went over there, so many of the men are the same, but many have gone!\n\nMore mail sent out to us. Mother, Grace Galbraith 4\/12\/16, Joe 17\/12\/16, Note re Farm 400\/-\/-, Day Dec. 21 poor Blackie May 16\/12\/16.\n\nMrs. Galbraith please thank. The Parcel with Housewife Laura is redirecting & now en route to me. Sorry to hear of Jac’s & Mikie’s Pat death.\n\nVery glad see that you all have had a change. I’m very fit & bucked at getting MAJORITY.\n\nWill send Power of Attorney with this to JOE.\n\nTell May I got Glasses & Fly Kill useful when summer comes.\n","26":"\n\nSome Yeomanry relieve us today & we go back to El Arish for a bit of a spell. Fortunately a Camel died so we can offer them some fresh meat!!!\n\nThe seasons are reversed here you know this – mid winter now & cold at night but lovely days. Outposts are cold work but we like to think that the Light Horse are always in the front line & have been for 1 year & 9 months, beyond a months spell while I was away in England.\n\nBedouin implements are even more crude than Egyptians – Harrow – piece of wood with stone pegs – Wooden Plows etc. The well we are using is one of 7 between here & Palestine put down by ? don’t know how many years ago.\n\nMonday 29 January 1917\n\n6 of our planes just flew over en route \nBersheba\n & well laden with bombs, with the aid of Glasses, these can be seen tied on under the body of Car – poor Johnnie Turk 5 for 1 is our arrangement in bombing. Clive Norton drew out my Power of Attorney & I forward here. With love to you all.\n\nTuesday 30 January 1917\n\nEL BURG\n\nRelieved yesterday by the Yeomanry but our men are happier away in front where there is the chance of a or two & an occasional shot. I won a Rooster last night from A Squadron. We each had only 1 & as there are 4 officers in each Squadron we tossed Snakes or Pheasants on Gippy coins, not heads & tails. SNAKE won.\n\nMore letters from England re-addressed by LAURA. \n\nMother Nov. 19th \n\nJoe & Daisy","27":"\n","28":" Card of DOGGIES\n\nThank you for song. Very good – Dolly does not sing or play – I like \nDorothy\n from other people, Dolly for myself & YOU.\n","29":"\n\nEl Risa\n\nNote what you say re Laura & Mardi – woman is always looking for slights etc. & its very tricky about many things. Hence I did not see as much of Mardi as I should have liked.\n\nAnother Khamsin sand blowing & altering the landscape, dunes come & go in this country of hummocks.\n\nFancy keeping horses SHOD all this time?!! simply coz the Army says Cavalry are to be shod so work for men & misery for Bush horses & great big iron shoes at that are used.\n\nMoonlight again & enemy planes over last night, they will come every night for a week now & BOMB us.\n","30":"\n\nJust took my Squadron to Rail-Head to be DELOUSED - !! \"Modus operandi\" – Engine supplies steam to closed in van into which each man’s clothes & Blankets are put he meanwhile going through a DIP –\n\nIt would do some of those sheep owners who won’t dip their LOUSY sheep to come here & be dipped themselves.\n\nKhamsin still blowing.\n\nReported enemy with their machine guns from planes on Yeomanry at EL BURG last night – I found several copper bullets & shrapnel around our Bivies after last visit. Jim Ayre just read me a lot of HAY letters with much news of the River & Riverina.\n\nStill Bandaged up like a sore finger – pampering my neck as BAINS FATHER would say\n","31":"\n\nOne gets very tired of the eternal sand, in face, ears tucker Bed etc. One continual dust storm for a week – We must eat lbs of it cooking in the open – but again MUD is worse.\n\nTerrific sand storm. Think the worst we have had.\n\nEnemy airships over again last night. \nGot pen going again.\n\nAllanson is despatch rider now.\n\nDid I explain a new nice sort of sandal the Infantry wear in about 4 sizes bigger than boots & strapped on like snow shoes the idea is to make marching easier.\n","32":"\n\nAnother mine washed up on the Beach, it looks like a big 3 legged POT turned upside down – the legs are the percussion caps to be touched by boats & then exploded – A machine gun was played on this & up it went.\n\nNearly full moon & at 12.30 I turned out ranks just as a Plane flew over but no bombs were dropped – It gets on the nerves of some of the troops & they cannot sleep, personally I worry not KISMET.\n","33":"\n\nChurch Parade\n\nCan’t quote the Bible passage but we had something about \"Building a road through the Desert\". I reckon we know something about that. Bombed again today & the shrapnel from our Anti Aircraft guns fell around us but no damage done – My 1 subaltern got a photo of a large MINE which I mentioned yesterday was blown up on the Beach. Weather warmer & cold better but I’m still wrapped up like a SARACENS head with Bandages. Put a CROWN up today for MAJOR, if I don’t get sick or wounded it will be permanent – but you are correct in addressing me as MAJOR now.\n","34":"\n\nJust heard that U.S.A. have joined us. This must help surely with SHIPS anyway – Was on outpost all last night a lovely moonlight & starlit night, but heavy dews & cold yet, by day the sand blows, till the jam is like grit & even the ZINC ointment in the Army Medical Tent is turned to KHAKI.\n\nI always feel inclined to write down, when I get the chance to have a BATH, it is such a red letter day for a man out here.\n\nHear today that we leave the front line for a spell. 2nd Brigade to relieve us & we go back some 3 days march, all ranks are sorry as the country was improving & our boys like to be the PRIDE of the line.\n","35":"\n\nPersonal\n\n\"Sitting\" on a \nBoard\n on a horse that was killed. After hearing the evidence & visiting the Body – The Board \nhaving viewed the Body\n found that the Horse was dead!! etc. etc. thro’ anti aircraft gun no blame being attached to anyone!!! etc. etc. Since my wedding has appeared in the Papers find I get much fewer letters & fewer PARCELS, still the wife makes up for all that. Re U.S.A. we had an order to recall all American some time ago - the reason was that some Yankee bombs had been filled with sawdust, of course this may be a libel.\n","36":"\n\nI see the Walgett Spectator offers me hearty congratulations on my wedding – it seems a long time since I left the Barwon.\n\nJim Ayre is in my Tent busy doing Pay Books, he is very popular in the Ranks & among all others. I wish he had a Commission – Turksdropped a message saying \"Don’t Bomb us we will have peace in a few days\" so the Yarn goes but as I did not see the message I take it \"cum grana salis\". El Arish is changing very quickly 1000s of the Egyptian Labor Corps are employed on Railways FORTS, PIERS etc.\n","37":"\n\nPersonal\n\nWill post this all my love to you & hope before another Birthday comes around I am with you all again.\n\nCopied\n\nLetters from Dolly, Laura, Davies, from England. All well. Laura will be sorry when the War is over if her husband has no occupation, he gets a little liberty now. I am told this place is the RHINOCOLURA where TITUS the Roman Emperor halted with his Troops en route to Jerusalem. The Wady which after rain becomes a bit of a stream is supposed to be the River of Egypt mentioned in Gen. 15 18 ? as forming the Western boundary of Abrahams possession. We are 50 miles from GAZA of the Philistines. Rafa is spelt Rhaphia in the Scripture.\n\nThe JOKE among the men is that the War will be over on FEB. 29!!!\n","38":"\n\nCopied\n\nPacked & said Goodbye to El Arish, going back 4 days march for a spell on the Flank.\n\nPapers from England & magazines from the new wife. Weather warmer but still pampering my neck. And all the way from Bronte came my old African spurs & the lighter racing ones, thank you for posting both.\n\nAlso letter card from May saying how busy she is & forwarding her song. Please acknowledge if the Power of Attorney reaches Joe I posted 2 mails ago. A Parcel of Tucker from the wife also came along – We have a canteen here now & the Railway feed us.\n","39":"\n\nMazar\n\nOn our way back to \"Beyond\", the first time our Reg. has ever been behind. Now a new Hospital train runs along the road. We pioneered fresh water at different spots, but our men would sooner be going on to Palestine.\n\nWet last night & I was Field Officer, but NO enemy near us now. We are on a 60 mile Trek & find much work has been done behind, later on it would be a good spec: to open a first class Hotel & Casino at El Arish for those Cooks tourists who will go this way to Palestine. TIMMS came & spoke to me today, he’s doing well.\n\nMonday 12 February 1917\n\nTILUL \nBIR-el-ABD\n\nStill on the road & raining hard – but all hands are happy. Passed several Catipillar Tractions pulling loads of 10 tons over the sand. Country gets more Desert like & has edible bush as we go back.

You will remember me speaking of BIR-el-ABD last July – now a big military Camp, Pumping Station, Hospitable etc. & a canteen both wet & dry.\n\n2 Officers came along & offered 2 bottles of Beer (with patent costs) for some butter. After they had gone we found bottles refilled with \nWater\n - Assualt made & Bivouacs wrecked – am afraid there will be many sore heads tomorrow, so many of these chaps overdo it when they reach a Canteen.\n\nsorry after all Mother’s work but am afraid it went \"down\" a boat.\n","43":"\n\n39 today\n\nMarched on to BAYOUD – do you remember me telling you of our first fight here early in June last year 8 months ago – The sand hummocks have blown a bit but I never expected to be here again. However the Yeomanry left their Tents standing & also some SCENT Candles, a bottle of Beer etc. We were very glad to have such good accommodation. I don’t feel much older but I know I look it. I only hope ere another year comes around I may be home in Australia \nwith my new wife\n even if it is to fight Droughts, Fires, Floods etc.\n\nTELL JOE I am sure Dolly would like a letter from him.\n","44":"\n\nOn Duty last night but I don’t think there is a TURK within 100 miles of us. Raining slightly.\n\nMany were drunk from the Canteen on the Railway – Like South Africa greed is an awful curse to the young soldiers altho’ I am no wowser. (Clive Norton in trouble.)\n\nHad a bath & put on a pair of \"judpores\", i.e. (Indian riding Pants), old Tommy Orford my Batman was greatly taken by the cut \n\n& called a Tommy Officer – this is not a compliment out here. Hear a mail is coming along & our pay – neck nearly allright. \n","45":"\n\n*The New Chums\"\n\nThe Yeomanry left a few decent Papers among them. I found a ‘BULUWAYO’ Times, mentioned many places I camped in in RHODESIA, so when I leave the ‘Deniliquin Independent’ & Walgett Spectator the new comers from perhaps Canada, will find some news on Australian. Our men are always \ngiving\n barracking *the New Chums about riding. As one fellow was leaving here with Saddlery badly put on, he was hailed with – \"Put the Saddle further back, your reins are too long\".\n\nGeneral - \nJ.B.

Your letter of Dec. 31st was such a nice long one, it came last night, also May’s song, too much forcing conscription to sell & not enough about GIRLS to take on with the Soldiers.\n","49":"\n\nI was warned last night to be ready to attend a Cavalry School at Zeitoun, a suburb of Cairo for 1 month – I am glad – it means a refresher, a course for Senior Officers – BATHS, clean clothes & Tucker & a chance to get rid of my infernal NILE BOILS etc:- I go in about 3 days time.\n\nYesterday a few HATS were being issued – 1 Soldier tried one & said QUATER (meaning Q.M.S.) this hat is too small, what one is it – the Quartermaster Sergeant replied 6 7\/8. Well, give me a 9.10.11 replied the Wag (TRUE).

CHISHOLM fed all ranks at a nominal cost – MISS McPHILLAM helps & Australians & N.Z.s all very thankful for the work these Ladies do, for the SOLDIERS & officers. It is indeed practical WAR work of the best kind. STONE Railway Stations are now being built & the old places we knew in their early desert life have much changed.\n","54":"\n\nArrived at ZEITOUN, mixed crowd of English & other officers.\n\nI took the shoes off my horses to give their feet a spell while I’m away. On the old Camel lines on the Desert a small quantity of grain, Barley & LENTILS have grown up from the waste feed & my man grazes the horses here, both are fat & doing well.\n","55":"\n\nZEITOUN\n\nCavalry School on Wesminster Dragoon Horses great collar \nmaketed\n marks ½ draft animal, very suitable for Gunners or Poison Cart but awful brutes to ride. Only \n3\n 2 paces are known WALK TROT anything over Trot is called galloping!! However these are side lines & a man can learn a lot.\n\nexcept if he is told to shorten his stirrup leathers, use both hands on them, put foot in now not ball of toe, etc:- rather amusing after all these years.\n\nIN Cairo for dinner & to buy uniforms etc. I am going to lead a simple life & save my pennies.\n\nTommy Officers are united up with us.\n","56":"\n\nMore Cavalry drill trotting about, & what we should do if we had lances etc. – the old saying \"if you want to learn how not to make money out of the Land go to an Agricultural College\".\n\nLetter card from May & just heard of the evacuation of KUT by TURKS.\n\nThe S.S. \"HUNTSEND\" boat I came from England in has been torpedoed in the Aegean Sea so I was lucky to arrive here safely – 2 LECTURES a day & much Military LAW, this is soldering!!! We’ve only been fighting.\n","57":"\n\nDid an Out Post time for a change & spent an evening with an old Scotch family I know at Zeitoun, had a time on Piano etc. Quite civilized – Lectures 2 per diem keeps me writing steadily & a RECONNAISSANCE tomorrow on approved EUROPEAN lines. We are getting this training to put us alongside English Cavalry if necessary.\n\nWent Cairo for Lunch at Continental. We get 3 hours 1 in middle of the day - & Saturday afternoon & Sundays off.\n","58":"\n\nAm posting you a \"VIVE PARISIENNE\" paper you will perhaps smile at some of the Broad Jokes but this is the paper the SOLDIERS all buy in France & here & is the best French lesson possible.\n\nDid Patrols today & 2 Lectures on Dismounted Attacks such as through the scrub on Gallipoli – war news better – my notes will be useful for future reference.\n\nWent to Remount Depot to see Col. McLeish but he was out. Heliopolis is very deserted now. Glorious weather and neck alright.\n","59":"\n\nMore lectures on how to win the war. Our instructors are men who have been through the MILL in France. It would cost a man about 100\/-\/- to go through a Cavalry School like this in Australia as \na volunteer yet some Officers waste their time in a drunken stupor. If I could I should like to keep up soldiering \"apres la guerre\".\n. This School teaches one all the up to date schemes learnt from sad experience in France & elsewhere.\n\nMy weight 13 stone 7 lbs.\n","60":"\n\nI am writing this at Shepherds Hotel where I met my wife nearly 2 years ago now. Did an examination this morning & a Staff Ride. In addition to a Cavalry School, other ranks all at different courses.\n\nOne of our boys was being cursed for not saluting & the Instructor said \"You are more Trouble than any other Unit operating in Egypt\". Reply was \"That is what the Turkssay\".\n\nTOM Austin is here one of Bertie’s sons I think he is, he got wounded at MAGDAHASA, but is alright now.\n","61":"\n\nLast night I watched the dancing at Shepherds & Continental Hotels. Many of my former partners knew me not but I did not care to dance.\n\nToday I went out to the HOSPITAL & saw all our wounded men & had dinner with General Meredith our late Colonel but now commanding 4 L.H. Brigade.\n\nCairo makes me tired, much dust & windy. Khamsin blowing – I must tell you what happened at SHEPHEARDS HOTEL – A Foreign Princess who has been there a long time tucked her table napkin into her \nBust\n dress & when she had finished forgot it & sailed out of the room with the table napkin. Some of us sent the Head waiter after her.\n","62":"\n\nGot 75 out of possible 80 for Exam, very interesting lecture on methods in France. We get enough mounted work AT THE TROT to keep us healthy.\n\nHad dinner last night with General MEREDITH D.S.O. now C.O. 4th Brigade once my C.O. 1st L.H. Reg. which is now commanded by Col. Granville.\n\nAm sending by Hospital ship sailing Wednesday for Australia a Revolver I took from a TURK at El Arish with a Camel Hair cord attached, per a Lieut MILLS who had his arm shot when observing from aeroplane, a Sydney DENTIST.\n","63":"\n\nYoung ROSS son of KIM ROSS people who used to have Horse Teams in the old days is here as a Lieut. He goes into Cairo with a car every day, when I go I go by TRAM or TRAIN, plenty of L.S.D. Do not mention Revolver in notes as we are not allowed to keep any arms taken in war but I have saved so few Trophies though would like to keep this one. NECK alright now & am feeling A1.\n\nThank you for Australasian. I see a lot about DELATITE in the last.\n\n Love to you from your son Frank.\n","64":"\n\nThe Sultan is camped close here in enormous marquee Tent with gold Balls along the Top – everything in great pomp.\n\nWe have comfortable quarters & I am learning quite a lot of useful stuff besides a good spell from the Desert. I shall cable as soon as my substantive or Permanent rank of MAJOR appears in Orders – it will date from February 2nd.\n\nI hope Joe will use any of my clothes that are any good to him NECKTIES etc. etc:- as time goes on only get old fashioned. Cabled you – as follows, Promoted MAJOR Feb. 2nd.\n","65":"\n\nLetter from Mother & Joe 14\/1\/17, also letter from Mrs. Stronge to say J.A.C. was dead.\n\nNote all the news, glad all’s well.\n\nLast night met old Marine Capt. PEARSE of Pastoralists Review at TURF CLUB, Cairo , he returns to Australia in a week or so, he may mention meeting me in his Paper.\n\nToday I passed the Turksprisoners, in site of our old Aerodrome Camp Heliopolis – they are well clothed & fat & photos & Cinemas are sent for propaganda work back to Constantinople & to Syria.\n","66":"\n\nCalled on Mrs. Cuth Fetherston Hough but did not seen Cuth – Mrs. Cuth is rather a foolish woman (talks too much).\n\nOld Pearse has been running the Comforts Fund & I got 150 Billys for my Squadron out of him. \n\nMy address – MAJOR WEIR 1st L.H. now. Am feeling very fit & well again – this 3 weeks has done me so much good. Letters Mother, Daisy, WIFE, Jany. 20th. Glad alls well at home. Thanks for Parcel, no doubt following on.\n","67":"\n\nExaminations this morning – This School would cost me a lot of money in Peace time & I appreciate my luck in attending. If I could afford it I would keep up soldering after the War in Australia but am afraid I will have my daily bread to earn as usual.\n\nWent Cairo Dinner & to CASINO etc.\n\nLaura tells me Nowell Forth is on his way here again.\n\nAm giving Pearse of PASTORALISTS REVIEW some photos to take to Australia, he will send you the Paper when printed.\n","68":"\n\nWent Cairo to Hospitals to see wounded & sick. Am sure the change will have done you & (MARTHA as Daisy is) good & JOE must find the monotony killing at times, he & you all are doing more in your way than we are who live an exciting life.\n\nMet me know if you get the Turk’s revolver & the photos I send by Capt. PEARSE of Pastoralists Review. I ran into STANLEY BRAIM at Heliopolis Hotel last night, he is I think drinking more than is good for him, I am afraid. I will write Eleanor but don’t tell her this.\n","69":"\n\nWent to Mr. DEVONSHIRE a Barrister for Afternoon Tea yesterday & in the morning went to No. 14 A.G. Hospital. Saw NORMAN ROBERTSON of now a MAJOR in Army Medical Corps. He had been injured in a Railway accident on the Desert line. Engine Ran off the RAILS, pinned the driver down, NORMAN cut his arm off with a pocket knife, with steam escaping all around. Driver was Scotty soldier who held his own Artery & without anaesthetics of any sort. After he smoked a cigarette while Norman photographed him.\n","70":"\n\nRobertson should get something for his coolness in the job we all think. Had a drink with A.B. Paterson & saw Col. McLeish of Yea at Remount Depot. \"Banjo\" has written another thing called WALK THAT HORSE. Have you heard the song.\n\n\"There’s a Trail that leads to home\" a corollary to the \"LONG, LONG TRAIL\" which no doubt is in Australia ere this. Stanley Braim seemed really pleased to see me, he was going up for an exam in the flying Corps but told the usual YARNS.\n","71":"\n\nAm doing well at the at the examinations & have had a good holiday, all over on Saturday.\n\nHad dinner with Capt. Pearse & gave him 32 snapshots of the fighting at Rafa & Magdaba & El Arish to give to you on arrival in Sydney, also a MILLS BOMB with all the Powder taken out. Quite safe.\n","72":"\n\nLetter from Aunt Anna which is so interesting telling me all about old father’s relatives. Did more Field work today. School closes tomorrow with EXAM. I have done well so far & am getting 2 days leave after. Saw Cuth Fetherston Hough & his wife. He should be getting his majority very soon now.\n\nI am writing his Father today.\n","73":"\n\nFinal Exam. I have done well.\n\nLast night we had all the Instructors & Imperial Cavalry Officers to dinner, it was one of the rowdiest RAGS I’ve been in – quite up to a Picnic Race Club night. I am very bruised & sore today, but have not laughed so much for a long time.\n\nI go to Continental Hotel tonight & stay Cairo till Monday then return to Desert. Our Brigade has gone to the front line again but not much fighting here now.\n","74":"\n\nYou remember me telling you last year about the way the Palms are utilized, this work is now being done among all the TREES. Weather glorious, & although there is no word in the Irish language for Gratitude, I am thankful I did not spend a Winter in France.\n\nThere is plenty of corn in Egypt still.\n","75":"\n\nThe Minister of Defence cabled for Lieut. Menzies to go to Australia for 6 weeks. I don’t know how it is done, but if you see Old Sam Mc.C. you could tell him. I have been a long time over here now if a job could be found even in Australia for a bit, wouldn’t it be glorious to see you all again.\n\nMrs. Handbury Davies is taking this letter to post in Australia.\n","76":"\n\nWent to Races on Saturday & met NOWEL FORTH there he is well, only arrived the night before from England. I sent you Race Book JOE may be interested – mostly Officers here & the youth & beauty of Cairo , with the rich Arabs & Bedouins rather fascinating to watch. I don’t like GIPPYS. Entrained for El Arish today to pick up Brigade. Posted you per Miss Handbury Davies another lot of photos same as I gave old Pearse of Pastoralists Review, to give you. We had a real live Russian Count here who is very upset at the Revolution a quaint old soul, who lives at SHEPHEARDS.\n","77":"\n\nDancing has been stopped at Shepheards & the Concerts so altho’ Cairo is now a blaze of light once more, (general Street lamps lit etc. no aeroplanes to raid) Officers outside have only the Casinos & Kellsaal to go to. Races & Pigeon Matches still flourish. In the latter TRAPS are not used but a \"nigger\" in a PIT throws the pigeon into the air & they take hitting 3 dead birds will nearly always win a sweep, with top notch pigeon shots from Monte Carlo among the shooters. Arrived El Arish once more, just in time to see the anti aircraft open fire on our old friend the TAUBE.\n","78":"\n\nBrigade is camped close to the Beach so it is not a bad spot for bathing, you need not worry about the enemy he is a long way from here now. Mr. PEARSE will get McKinnon & Lavender to send along the B- he takes to Australia for me \nunloaded\n.\n\nAfter the Troop Train had pulled up & commenced to unload – the R.T.O., i.e. Railway Transport Officer, rushed along calling out for the guard, saying \"How do I know the train has arrived finally. The Guard reports to me.\" Of such is some of the Red Tape Brigade.\n","79":"\n\nMoved on closer to the water at El Arish, my Tent faces the sea & the Railway runs past the door – quite suburban. I found my horses FAT & well.\n\nSuch a surprise from the POST OFFICE. Many Papers from YOU & also the HOUSEWIFE at last, it is such a beauty, with everything a man wants, also DAYS sleeping SOKS – I just had the old ones washed. New ones I will keep. 4 PARCELS altogether 2 from DOLLY & another from YOU & DAY with PLUM PUDDINGS etc. chewing gum \nalso\n have now arrived PAPERS from the wife.\n","80":"\n\nLetter from ISHERWOOD my brother in law who is at SALONIKA. Good news on all fronts, I anticipate a resolution in Germany before it is all over.\n\nENEMY aeroplanes over again this morning, but they did not drop any bombs.\n\nYesterday the Races were held at Rafa.\n\nAnzac mounted Division won 5 out of 7 Races. I did not go – the Races were sort of Public & a Totalisator was worked.\n\nAlso heard our Division enters GAZA tomorrow. Just had a bathe & am now Field Officer for the next 24 hours.\n","81":"\n\nBig Mail tonight from AUSTRALIA & England.\n\n2 Mothers & DAYS, JOE, WIFE MAY, LAURA & Mr. FERRAR.\n\nThank you all so much. I was so glad the Housewife arrived safely.\n\nRe putting names in, quite O.K. when you get my DIARY so long after, no harm can result. Dolly is well & cheerful. Am glad you are all away. Am getting my Desert LEGS again, walking in the sand is quite different to walking in Cairo one gets shin sore there.\n","82":"\n\nIt is a treat to ride a decent horse again after the half drafts at the Cavalry School. Owing to the sand our horses have all learned to walk fast. I suppose its trying to keep up to the fast walkers & not trot, but no Wesminster is equal to the old horses for sale.\n\nAll day & night freight trains go bye loaded up with forage & Bully Beef & Biscuits & in the Bay or such as it is, are many boats unloading stores for the Army. You might think we talk a lot about the war, but I’m afraid Officers & man’s chief topic of conversation is Girls & their tucker. Read \"A Wife out of EGYPT\" by \nDouglas Siddern\n MISS LORIMER (it is good).\n","83":"\n\nEl Arish\n\nBig guns can be heard firing at Gaza, the big attack takes place today. We are in Reserve standing bye – doing nothing & enjoying the bathing in the sea.\n\nLast night, one poor trooper went silly or \"MAGNOON\" as the Arabs say. Walked away with his swag to the Flying Corps & asked for a PLANE to take him to England. They offered him a MARTINSIDE, but he would have nothing but a TAUBE, he said. Poor Beggar is now in the Hospital awaiting train for Cairo mental cases. I hope I don’t get it as bad as that!\n","84":"\n\nLetters again \nCensored\n. Mother 17\/2\/17, Day 19\/2\/17 JOE 18\/2\/17, Clare Wheeler HAY. All so welcome. Yes little Mother your housewife came at last & such a useful one. I can see how you thought of everything little things I wanted & Days SOKS too. So many thanks.\n\nI hope some day to go fishing with JOE on the Hopkins. I always love old Carrakoorte & the River. I cant see how JOE could volunteer – he is doing more than his share by carrying the load at home - & keeping us going. I see you are sending me another parcel & Barrini sends the Cakes & chocs – I’m afraid I’m getting terribly spoilt.\n\nI would write Barrini but forget her address.\n","85":"\n\nThe fight is going well & Regiment + 16 Officers are told off to escort prisoners to Cairo . We lost an aeroplane & both men killed this morning. All is well & the weather lovely at present.\n\nEvery afternoon we have football matches RUGBY – a game I never played being at school in Victoria it is making the men very fit & well. Looking back at the Military School it did us all good & served to shake together the Australian & English Officers, \nwho are always inclined to view each other from afar off & to criticize each other.\n","86":"\n\nClimate lovely now.\n\n Just recd. your Cable of Congratulations. All’s well for which many thanks. I hope you get my letters even if later than in the post.\n\nI am not saying much about the GAZA Battle it is still sub judice. Another Gun boat just passed full steam ahead. Several Monitors are helping & our Infantry are dug in. Reinforcements reached the Turks& they are holding out.\n\nMy troubles last night were caused by Field Mice burrowing near my face & covering my head with sand kicked up by their little hind legs. A light dazzles them & they stand quite still & stare.\n","87":"\n\nVery Hot.\n\n Letters from wife, Cousins & May Harrison up to Feb. 8th also Australasian from you - & other Papers. Please tell MAY I can \nnot\n write so often as I would wish, you tell her my news but with the Wife & you & my work more is impossible. In case we move out quickly I’ll post this now.\n\nThe letters by Miss Hanbury Davies are hung up. No women allowed to leave Egypt at present. I do not know the Lady but Mrs. Cuth Fetherston Hough was good enough to hand them on. \nLove to all, Son\n","88":"\n\nInoculated again for Cholera. I would like to look up Diary & see how many punctures that makes!\n\nLast night some men got some of the B.W.I. (British West Indians) who are camped near to BOX in the Y.M.C.A. Tent, they looked like shining ebony ponies alongside our big fellows & they had no idea of boxing HIT, KICK, & wrestle – most amusing – Y.M.C.A. one of the best institutions out here – makes men write letters home by supplying all necessary stationery etc. & keeps them away from WET CANTEEN.\n\n 1200\/-\/- Pay for the Reg. has just been dumped in my Tent in a sandbag – all paper money these days.\n","89":"\n\n 4600 Casualties at Gaza so far 600 Killed – Tanks – Howitzers not yet in. Papers will tell you I can’t coz of Censor but it is a big fight at Gaza still. Another Parcel tonight from Mother – 2 cakes chocs. etc. & Punch – thank you all so much. \n\nWent to Church & stayed for Communion. I’m not a hyprocrite, I hope, but our Padre GORDON is leaving us & he is a really good man & has done a lot for all ranks in our Brigade – just heard GAZA is evacuated & Turksretreating. We move up in a few days. This is now only a yarn 1st April about GAZA.\n","90":"\n\nField Officer today. Marching Orders for Friday to move on. We had arranged a Race Meeting for Thursday next, in the WADI, must keep the men interested & fit. Football is the great game at present, in the sand! They cannot trust themselves.\n\n You might think we disparage the ENGLISH Officer sometimes, but heres the sort of thing we get. Speaking of the Rabbit Plague – 1 Cocksure young Cub, insisted if 2 or 3 of PA’s poachers or gamekeepers went out to AUS, they would teach you how to KILL RABBITS. \n\nI enclose the entries for the 1st L.H. El Arish RACES.\n","91":"\n\nI enclose a small snapshot of the month of the WADI El Arish. Here large numbers of \"Pelicans\" come & feed on the fish in the shallow pools. We have had a good camp here & will miss our Tents etc. when we move on to a Mobile Desert Column again. Photos are poor things to show you the beauty of the sunsets here.\n\nThe Fig Trees at El Arish are covered with leaves now & look very pretty, make the WADI look like a park.\n","92":"\n\n1st L.H.B. Races today. Bales of Tibbin made the Handles, the Butchers Scales on the Shafts of the Medical cart for Weighing in, Cartridge Pouches for Lead Bags & Armlets of Bandages with No. in indelible INK in lieu of Saddle Cloths. The Trumpeter sounded the saddle up & Starters, Empty Biscuit TINS marked the Saddling Paddock & Track, & notwithstanding an enemy Plane flew over to have a look we had a really good days sport. I won 12\/-\/-- in a sweep, but did not start my own horses as they are not built to gallop.\n","93":"\n\nAs the Mail closes tonight & we move tomorrow morning into the Cactus Country of Gaza I am posting this.\n\n Hoping we may all meet very soon. Love to all, your son, Frank.\n","94":"\n\n7 A.M. At 0700 we moved out of El Arish once more for GAZA, past our old Camp, remember where I dug up 2 bottles of Kerosine I had buried after Magdabah fight as I could not carry them at the time. Men & Horses fit.\n\nThe 4 L.H. Brigade relieved us & I had a few words with Cuth Fetherston Hough. We are leaving – he is fit & well. We are marching light but the weather is warming up now altho’ heavy dew at night. Great improvements have been made in the defences of this El Arish. Camped at SHEIK ZOWAID or as the men call it 6 x 8. I have no blotting paper but SAND did the ancients & its good enough for me\n","95":"\n\nPALESTINE, KHAN YUNAS\n\nClive Weston is my Quarter-master Sergeant \nit is hard to keep him sober & the day will come when he will be broken. I have wet-nursed him for his family’s sake. The old REG. arrived here.\n Enemy bombed our arrival.\n\nLeft the sand & the Desert. Country here good. Barley crops & wild RYE, CROWFOOT, OAT GRASS LAMBS TONGUE, MUSTARD, COUCH GRASS, & VETCHES, with QUAIL among it.\n\nEnemy here. He occupied SHELLAL & we shall fight him 3 days or so, so it is rumoured. Flowers everywhere, fields of POPPIES, DAISYS, etc. it is springtime here. I reckon good sheep proposition or Meat country.\n\nEaster Day","96":"\n\nRe sheep when I have time I’ll write Minister of Agriculture re possibility of RAM Trade here with Australia. They are mongrel sheep but the country is good. I can see Turksshells bursting over our planes as I write.\n\nMarching here we passed over the Rafa Battlefield & saw the graves of the men we lost there Jan. 9th. The Bedouins were gathering their Barley over the Battlefield, shells everywhere.\n\nKHAN YUNUS is covered with prickly pears & scrubby Bushes, Old Ruins on every side, not too good to fight in, we got Hotchkiss guns issued today.\n","97":"\n\nBombed again. \n\"Australian\" arrived & letter from the wife.\n We are still waiting for the big fight, Egyptian word BUCKRAH meaning tomorrow applies, but I think it will be tomorrow. Enemy planes over every day now. Will not post this for sometime as Censors are very strict out here. \nGood thing my writing so bad, can’t read it.\n Had a letter from Nowell Forth he is O.C. Camel Corps at ABBASSIA a suburb of Cairo .\n\nCut all my hair off & had a bath ready now for Constantinople if caught.\n\nSee Bible AMOS, Chap. 17 verses 6 & 7.\n","98":"\n\nWe passed the Boundary Stones of Syria I mentioned in January & took some photos. Pen is bad. I am trying to write HOME. Our TRANSPORT went along the Beach, but we went direct & are now about 50 miles from the DEAD SEA. Murgha Mack has gone to Hospital with a growth on his tongue thought to be Cancer.\n\n On my way to the troughs I met a L.H. man, by my beside his horse. I thought he was sick, but he replied \"I’m alright\" he was drunk. When I asked him where he wanted to go he replied \"To the firing line Kura - \"Crusader\". No idea where he got the tanglefoot from.\n\nIt was just here that SAMSON was supposed to be Killed, the Old Testament speaks a lot about this part of the world.\n","99":"\n\nReconnaissance yesterday evening. I went 5 miles past the Outpost line & got shelled by enemy. Water very scarce saw plenty of Turks1 & their line of Tranches was plainly seen. Fun on sand, beautiful green feed but no natural water.\n\nI rode 40 miles - & took a lot of Bearings by Compass.\n\nEnemy plane flew low over us & fired his machine gun. No fountain pen ink so try & forgive pencil.\n\nFound letters on my return – MAY 4\/4\/17, LAURA 20\/4\/17, FERRAR 20\/4\/17, DOLLY 20\/4\/17. Alls well.\n","100":"\n\nAt Outpost tonight – enemy 6 planes bombed our Aerodrome. Our Machines flew out like a lot of scalded ants if you poured hot water into the nest. We have not got the best machines out here I’m afraid.\n\n Got some silk soks from Col. now General Meredith’s daughter. General Cox is now our Brigadier. J.B. Meredith has the 4 L.H. Brigade. \n\nFound a snake in our trench, scorpions are plentiful among the old Roman antiquities. Our Adjutant brought me a collection of wildflowers he had gathered. There are many different sorts.\n","101":"\n\nOur horses are a bit shin sore coming off the Sandy Desert into this good country – they are all very good walkers now - & got good grazing on the crops of Bearded Wheat & Barley – but Water is still scarce. \nJOE 4\/3\/17. Letters from Mother & Daisy & May 27\/2\/17. Papers from Dolly & a Cake from Laura. All very acceptable.\n - on our arrival back into Camp after 24 hours on Outpost.\n\nEvery day we can watch our anti aircraft shells bursting among enemy planes – not much success tho’. \nDay’s letter had large cutting of D’quin Paper\n.\n","102":"\n\nTurksshelled our rail head with big guns this morning – but we are camped a little back. We can bathe but are warned that sharks & mines are on the beach!! Comforting.\n\nParcel of Plum Duff Lanoline Shaving Soap Sweets all arrived safely. Never send CHEESE. We get it issued like Oil in the heat – and Tinned Milk is not worth sending. All the above many thanks. I am being very well treated.\n\n Am glad JOE had some good fishing at King on Hopkins, some day I hope we may go there together.\n","103":"\n\nEnemy shelled Railhead yesterday & again today. Attended Service, but many heads were turned up to the Sky watching the effect of our Anti aircraft guns firing on Plane directly over our heads.\n\nMurgha MACK is alright, no cancer.\n\nJust posted 2 Field Post Cards as we move out to the big attack tomorrow night – I’m A1 & so are all the men.\n\nLove to all from son\n","104":"\n\nI wish you could see me in my GAS MASK like a Teddy bear will send you a photo if possible – all ranks are issued with them.\n\nNight march on SHELLAL infantry attack GAZA at dawn.\n\nArrived SHELLAL 5 A.M. My Squadron left Flank Guard. Good country – large quantity of cultivation Barley & Wheat – Grasses including all I gave before plus BARLEY & TIMOTHY Umbrella & Couch. Just been over to the 6th L.H. to see some old friends. They tell me they will meet me in the Hospital Clearing Station tomorrow – Cheerful.\n","105":"\n\nVery Hot. On OUTPOST tonight in the front line.\n\nEnemy bombed us while watering & killed 5 of another Regiment.\n\nRode about most of the night keeping up inter-communication. Picquet fired on Turkish Patrol. INFANTRY took first position of GAZA. \nmany prisoners\n We hope to finish the job tomorrow, the Cables will tell you all details, long ere this reaches you & besides I cannot break faith – but we are hopeful of doing great things with our TANKS etc.\n","106":"\n\nAnother hot day. Big guns firing all around & enemy planes bombing – got a headache but could always do 3 nights out of bed at the Picnic Races so can do it now. All is going well & the SKYLARKS singing many a brave man’s Requiem.\n\nIn advance tonight moving out at 11 p.m. & my Squadron took up a position before dawn in a deep donga. Turksshelled us all day could not even light a Fire to boil the quart. Can see great activity in Turksroads. Fought on hill near 470.\n","107":"\n\nMarched all night, in action at 0400 – shelled by enemy big fight on all around hope live through it. Two of my friends Killed \nMAJOR CHISHOLM & LIEUT CHAMBERS of 2 L.H. SINCLAIR (some PUCKAWIDGEE relative\n. We have many casualties 71 Horses. Bombed by enemy air craft again – cold blooded business. One of our planes shot down by enemy this afternoon.\n\nMany Fleas – its harder to catch than LICE.\n\nMAJOR CHAMBERS of 12 also killed today attack 2 of same day\n. I hope Cuth is alright.\n","108":"\n\nOUTPOST HAGILI\n\nOn Outpost all last night again, night & day is so mixed up. I am not sure of the date. Our horses have not been unsaddled since MONDAY & of course none of us have even washed since then. \nWe have not made a success of our attacks.\n I went into a Bedouin Hut. The consequences have been catching FLEAS ever since 1000’s of them. They do not bite so much as run about. Very dusty from Divisions moving about. \nJoe’s\n glasses are most useful & save my eyes a lot. This Agricultural Land is much dirtier & cuts up more than the pure Desert Sand.\n","109":"\n\nABASAN KEBIR\n\nStill in the front line very tired but going strong – have not had a wash for a week. Still all in the game. Our men are always at their best when the pinch comes – but these pinches make a man old & reduce his Tummy some. Off again at dark on a counter march of 12 miles – like a game of Chess, interesting if not so damnable sleepy. The whole landscape rises & falls in front of a man, he sleeps on his horse odd moments. Still this is soldiering.\n","110":"\n\nABUSSITTA\n\nMarched again all night & bombed again this morning. Approved to have 24 hours rest but being continually bombed gets on your nerves. Enemy shot down another of our planes last night, it burst into flames on reaching the ground.\n\nWater is still the trouble but the country could easily be developed in this respect.\n\nSuddenly we saddled up & moved again at 3 p.m. & camped at again. This life is like chassing De Witt in Africa. \nMAIL from Dolly, Laura & Paper from Ferrar.\n The Field Post office follows us.\n","111":"\n\nMove out to support again. This is a new line of Trenches. Casualities have been heavy. I hope Nowell Forth is alright. I believe he came out just before this fight began.\n\nBombed again today & more horses & men Killed. I must say I do not like bombs.\n\nOur horses are SHIN SORE coming on to the hard ground after the Desert Sand. There are no trees in this part except \non ground\n Orchards of Almond, Peach, Apricot, Vines Figs Pomegranates etc., not in season yet – tho’ 1000s of acres of Barley & Wheat are nearly ready for the stripper. NO FENCES in this country.\n","112":"\n\nABUSITTA\n\nHad a shave & wash over in a quart of water hair cut close & a good flea hunt so am fresher. Very hot & crops ripening fast.\n\nMy Squadron doing pick & shovel work making road over WADI. Enemy plane over again but we have shot down 3. 3rd Brigade captured a Troop of Lancers yesterday, Horses & all. \ndon’t think Turkish Cavalry have much GUTS.\n\n They serve their GUNS well & are superior in the air coz of better machines (don’t repeat this).\n","113":"\n\nABUSSITTA\n\nSnakes, Scorpions etc. more plentiful here & much more insect life of every description, reason I suppose bigger population than the Desert.\n\nManaged to get some tinned Fruit sent by Pack Horse from Canteen at Railhead this morning.\n\n Australian NEWS SHEET cabled to the Troops consists of \"Egg Laying Competition\", \"Plague of ‘Possums\"!! \"Dinner to Holman\"!! etc. !!! What we would like to know is \"Seasons\" – Repatriation, and other items of interest.\n\nVery Hot about 110°.\n","114":"\n\nSHEIKH-NURAN\n\nMarched at 3 A.M. as enemy threatened our Flanks, did not require a Blanket last night & the dew is not so heavy. Water is still our trouble. I have not washed for 2 days & never had clothes off since this scrap started. Guns always firing from 60 Howitzers & 18 po. Field guns. Horses are still very fit I am glad to say.\n\n Received letter from Laura April 2nd. All’s well, but England is really awakening to the fact that a war is on & I was disgusted with a lot I saw at home.\n\nI have no INK for Fountain Pen so forgive pencil but don’t send any INK I could not carry & must wait.\n","115":"\n\nSHELLAL\n\nOn outpost again last night, it actually rained & after the heat turned quite cold. I washed & shaved this morning. Sullivan of Deniliquin, Bullock driver is my Batman now.\n\nWe are camped in a rugged water worn WADI but no water.\n\nHear that a mail is in Camp.\n\n My substantive Rank of MAJOR came through in Orders so am Temporary no longer & if go sick or wounded I do not revert. Don’t know when I’ll post this.\n","116":"\n\nHESIA\n\nLeft Camp at 0530 i.e., 5.30 A.M. & patrolled NO-MANS-LAND got shelled but home without loss – by sundown – each man carrying a bit of Firewood from some HUTS & no doubt many Fleas.\n\nToo cloudy to Helio.\n\nI just overheard the following \"If you want good Bully & milk look for an Australian brand it beats Argentine Yankee or any other, but the wrappers are not so gay.\n","117":"\n\nHISEA\n\n 2 Letters from Mother 19\/3\/17, Day JOE Auntie, all very welcome & with me still, 19\/3\/17 Jim Ayre told me of GORDONS engagement also heard from Winnie MILLS. Into all home news & thank you for cutting of Paper also Vegetables to come – in Parcel. \n\nAm posting this today as do not want it to fall into enemy hands. \n\n Love to all, your son, Frank.\n\nI am wondering if this Diary will see the war out – better post me one about 1st August I think.\n","118":"\n\nPosted notes yesterday acknowledging letters from home","119":" Quite cold for a change. We are still having a rough time.\n\n I am glad JOE saw he is indispensable at home & doing more than his Bit.\n\nI look forward to a reunion some day soon. Enemy plane with black + on wings is soaring above me as I write, & the little rings of bursting shells from our Anti aircraft now all around her but never hit – as far as we know. On Outpost last night & digging Trenches today with Stables, to do it gives little time for the men to cook, delouse themselves or sleep – but men & horses are fit & cheery. \nWise not to discuss my DIARY if Military is hearing\n.\n","120":"\n\nBombed again. 1000s of acres of Crops are ready for the Strippers here & we are eating it down by grazing Camels & Horses, & the ground has only been scratched by a wooden Plow yet bearded Barley & Wheat are good. I have already told you of natural grasses but no Timber of any description – rolling open downs.\n\nThis is the great Revolution Day & I wonder if the Socialists in Germany will show up the real feelings of the MASS of the HUNS – one would think the world was getting tired of WAR. Moved Camp again.\n","121":"\n\nSHELLAL\n\nThe Turksare better diggers than we are at present. We occupy what was once their Field Hospital. Big Crescent made of White Stones like rather worn Funk holes & so suffer casualties. \n\n Turkswere reported in front early this morning but turned out to be PELICANS feeding on the plain when day light broke.\n\nYour Parcel of Vegetables from Mutual Store arrived safely tonight, many thanks.\n\nJim Ayre is in my Brig. having a crack, he is pretty fit still & just had some news of Jean & Lucy. POLL DAY held in my Dug Out I.W.W. versus WIN THE WAR PARTY.\n","122":"\n\nNot much interest in the Election, it is overshadowed by the more immediate discomforts of soldiering & the War but I think the Ministerialists will have a big majority. The Railway is coming along slowly. We don’t want to repeat the \"KUT\" episode & get cut off though.\n\nWe growled at the Sand of the Desert but it was clean compared to this Agricultural land. Our casualties have been many, but the cable will have published names ere this, many of my friends have gone – with luck I ought to see it through now.\n","123":"\n\nWADI-GUZZI\n\nCairo was rather upset on a recent morning – it woke up to find some (Australian of course) soldiers had climbed up the Statue of MOHAMET ALI & put a nosebag on the horse! This is erected in principal Square of the city.\n\nMy horses are doing well on good grazing. S’pose after the war they will fall into the hands of the Remount Depot & get their tails & manes chopped off – this is the first thing a Tommy does with a horse.\n\nWe are camped in a big water worn rugged Donga or WADI about ¼ wide down which the water has run for many centuries down to the sea.\n","124":"\n\nLooking over the A.I.F. Casualty Lists in Australian Papers one notices that the Lists are printed in small type – not much space wasted. Do you remember the promincence of the first lists from Gallipoli – I suppose a 9 days wonder to many – yet it’s the young men of a young nation going. \n\nWhile digging our men unearthed an old Greek Temple with a MOSAIC floor of green Red Black green & white stones & figures of LIONS, TIGERS, BIRDS etc. with dado of \"SWASTIKAS\". The following inscription was just readable\n","125":"\n\nBombed again – it’s just like a Hawk in a chicken yard the way we scatter when the HUN flies over us.\n\nNo Church today only digging Trenches. Hear Russia is getting full up, but we know little of the true state of affairs.\n\nLetters from Laura & Dolly\n - MAIL has been regular of late. Had your vegetables for Tea tonight very good.\n","126":"\n\nThis morning we all went through GAS fumes with Helmets on a suffocating business. Enemy bombed Hospitals during night & Killed & wounded many. From the Outpost here today I could see the train leaving Beersheba. We will have a lot of hard fighting ere we enter Jerusalem. As a chance occurs I’ll post this. \nLove to all\n","127":"\n\nThe Turksbombed the Red + Hospitals at Railhead last night & used their Machine Guns. Of course the whole of the Hospitals were lit up & made an easy Target. Up to \nknow\n now JACKO always played the game, it sounds like German influence. The Crops are now ripe & grass seeds falling (blankets full of them). SCORPIONS & SNAKES plentiful, about the old ruins & in the WADIS but climate cooler than Egypt.\n\nI’ve not had my boots off at night for 3 weeks now.\n\nWas given some INK last night so Pen goes again.\n","128":"\n\nSHELLAL again\n\nOur Y.M.C.A. have followed us up consequently Tinned Fruits & \"Sausages\" can be bought, also good old ENO’s fruit Salts. Jim Ayre is still fit & going strong. Usual bombardment going on. Made overtures to the Tommies & used a Kerosene Tin bath along with many of the great unwashed. I was rather ashamed of my own dirty singlet. \nMy Major Rank dates from 14\/2\/17.\n\nHear Cuth Fetherston Hough is alright – but ere this you will have seen the Casualty list. I will always cable if I get a crack, so don’t worry we can’t all be blown out.\n\nThe little wife is well.\n","129":"\n\nHear a Mail is in but if I put down all the Rumours we hear the Censor would get a fit. Railway from Rafa Junction coming along slowly. Turksblew up the Pipe line last week but we have a fresh spring in this WADI or Donga as we called them in S. Africa.\n\n One of our planes just flew over here every cylinder working, whereas the HUN machine is comparatively noiseless & twice as fast. Have not heard of NOWELL FORTH for some time. He is quite English now & like Laura & Charlie does not like to be mistaken for an Australian soldier but an English Regular. Dolly met the latter in London.\n","130":"\n\nTime runs on & we are still facing the Turksbut well entrenched & Barb wire entanglements in front. Our daily bombs are dropped 1st by the Turkson us then our planes visit them & do likewise. Did I tell you of the GAS practice, we have had marching through our own GAS FUMES wearing our Helmets, a suffocating experience at first, & in appearance makes men look hideous. Some day I hope to be rid of it all & back among Rabbits, Fires, Burrs Blowflies & even Strikes. Saw 2 Curlews tonight which made me think of old shooting days \nwith JOE\n.\n","131":"\n\nI have spoken before of the cleanliness of the TurksCamp all discipline. Here not a TIN or BOTTLE or Bag \ncan\n to be seen on our arrival & the whole WADI absolutely clean. All Camel & Horse Manure burnt etc. – evidence of the fear of Disease & German discipline I suppose.\n\n Also DIARY 15\/1\/17. Letter Mother JOE Day Mch. 25 & April 1st & also H.L.A. The latter asks me to bring my wife to Eli Elivah. I shall be glad to do so some day. Do you notice how \nbadly\n Dolly \nspeaks\n even after being at one of the best schools in England. Also Papers thank you. The old Home must be kept as well as ever. Am sorry TESS had to be shot.\n","132":"\n\nThank you for returning CLARRIE DANIELS diaries they are very beautiful.\n Last night an exciting AIR FIGHT occurred just outside our Trenches. The HUNS chased 2 of our machines & brought one down. Then like a Hawk circled over us while I let loose 1400 rounds & never scratched him. An Aviator was burnt a bit but not killed. Oh the machine was presented by Commercial Travellers of N.S.W. but the HUN has too much speed & their flying men are certainly game. Letters from England the wife is enjoying herself in London rather a spoilt Child I am afraid. Am back into SHORTS again for the summer legs show very white for a start.\n","133":"\n\nShifted Camp behind another Squadron for 2 days spell, but we are still in the front line & see scrapping of various sorts each day. \nAir duels we do not shine in.\n What we would like to know is, RUSSIA’S intentions. The Papers say Starvation Conditions exist here, all I can say re Army rations is they are sufficient. We would like to know the correct & true position of the War, so much is cooked for our own digestion. Thanks for Local Paper – I get the HAY Grazier at times & am still interested in Saffron, Thistles, Rabbits, Shire Council & even who is Herdsman at CARRATHOOL.\n","134":"\n\n The enclosed cutting by K was written by Officers Mess. Cook KEPPIE quite a good fellow. Our men had another go at enemy plane & altho’ firing a good 50 yards ahead at 700 yards range couldn’t hit a feather out of the HUN.\n\nRained last night, dust now MUD & as the crops are ripe \nmust be harvested\n will do a lot of damage. The men are all fully fit. Septic Sores being chief trouble, but as one Trooper remarked \"How can you expect anything different when LAZARUS was covered with sores, must be result of local conditions apart from Army.\"\n","135":"\n\nStill on outpost. Small scraps occur every day t’wixt Turks& our PATROL & the railway crawls along towards us. I enclose cutting from bulletin. Trooper K is our cook Old Keppie, a splendid chap & a Bushie. I did not know he had literary talent. I don’t know what the C.O. thinks about his last statement.\n\n If old Sam comes thro’ D’quin he might be able to get me leave to come home but I’m doubtful. I see the old man went to America.\n\nJim Ayre has collected a lot of seeds & I’m enclosing some – hope no noxious weeds among ‘em. Just wild flowers from the Holy Land.\n","136":"\n\nStill outpost. We used to be called the \"KIWI\" LANCERS in HELIOPOLIS but I am afraid there is nothing of the \"exquisite\" about us now.\n\nOne of our \"planes\" down today, the pilot rode home on the Tail of his mates machine.\n\nWill post this as we go on a raid tomorrow & I don’t like running the risk of being blown out or captured with any Diary on me.\n\nLove to all, hoping ere long we may all be together again.\n","137":"\n\nPosted notes yesterday – am afraid my easy writing is cussed hard reading but I try & put in a few lines to show you I never forget you all at home & to let you know \"All’s Well. See Copy.\n\n On Reconnaissance had 1 horse shot. Turkswatch us, we watch Turks. Every afternoon \nabout noon\n the wind rises & clouds of dust blown from the North nearly as bad as a Riverina Dust storm. Shifted Camp last night back across the WADI. Our turn for the Trench having finished for a time.\n\nWill let Joe know if I am into CHANTER.\n","138":"\n\nSome Gift stuff for the men given out. It would add value to every article if \nsome one’s name was on it\n - as the idea that it is a personal gift appeals to all ranks as much as the value.\n\nHeavy Dust storm last night – I must be getting nervy – Coz, a cricket walked over my face & I sprang 2 ft. out of my Blankets – thinking it was a SCORPION. At one HUT yesterday I found 20 Cisterns or SILOS about 12 ft. deep 6’ wide & a manhole to enter. These Holes are used to store the grain in, it seems to keep all right. I wonder how it would work in our country.\n","139":"\n\nWent to Church Parade, didn’t feel much better as ears were full of sand from Khamsin. Am now killing Flies \nby\n with some Tanglefoot on knee, 20 dead. A big Mail has been lost at sea so the letters \nfrom the wee wife\n are lost I expect. 52 Flies now dead. I do wish I could get a photo of the Squadron in their GAS HELMETS. You will see the same in Illustrated English Papers. Lost count of dead Flies!!! \nbut\n Insecticide is good stuff to send. Fly Paper one is apt to sit on!!! But all these things can now be bought at the CANTEEN at Railhead. Getting to it is the trouble.\n","140":"\n\n Went KHAN YUNUS to take summary of evidence in another \nGROG\n case. Beer does not do much harm, but the rotten whisky men get hold of causes a lot of trouble. Stayed the night & returned in morning. Had letters from Laura, the wife & Papers from Mrs. Cotton – Charlie had gone back to France.\n\nMuch of the Harvest is now being gathered by the inhabitants, in behind our lines. A broader Railway & Pipe line & many other improvements I noticed in my ride today.\n","141":"\n\nLunched at Division Head Quarters. Weather much warmer now but Khamsin has stopped Howling. \n\nOff on the Raid this afternoon a 36 hour stunt to blow up the railway. I cannot go into details but it means fighting our way & 2 nights in the Saddle. I hope I am back to continue my Diary tomorrow or with a nice soft wound en route for Cairo . Allanson is here going strong on Galloper, he often brings me a message from the C.O.\n","142":"\n\nNothing doing no BLIGHT or wound.\n\nI write this going on covering party for Royal Engineers who are using Gun Cotton & doing great destruction to Bridges culverts Railway Stations etc. 30 miles from our Camp. We rode all night my Squadron in the advance. The enemy had evacuated but many Bedouins here. Much Wheat burnt by us. Now 9 a.m. We leave in a few hours time for Camp again & expect some opposition from Beersheba. \n\nThe Power that rules these things gave us a cloudy day so enemy planes have not yet discovered us. Country stonier down here & better water. Germans had built a Mosque etc. etc. to gain Kudos here among Bedouins.\n","143":"\n\nRAID.\n\nWe got home after a 70 mile ride at midnight last night – all ranks very tired but we did our job, blew up 2 large Stone Bridges & 5 miles of Railway & burnt many stacks of wheat. I could have got plenty of mutton & Fowls but TIME was the essence of the Contract so only got 2 Sheep & 10 Fowls.\n\nAs a consequence the enemy are bombing us today. We could have taken many Camels but had not the time, it was just a quick rush there & back. My Squadron was in the advance & we went 32 mile the other side of the Railway line & first cut the Telegraph line each side of Station. All well built German controlled.\n","144":"\n\nWe hear General S-ts is coming here – he will be popular.\n\nMen & horses recovering from want of sleep. As long as a man or a horse is young, the power of recuperation is there. I am adding a wrinkle or two as each year of WAR goes bye.\n\nKAISER’s grandmother’s birthday yesterday!! We did not celebrate it in the usual way – but had a RUM issue for the men on a\/c of extra fatigue.\n\nDust very bad in this Camp & bombed again today.\n\nLetters from Mother 8\/4\/17 & 161\/4\/17 with Cuttings, DAY 8\/4\/17, JOE 8\/4\/17 & Mrs. Stronge.\n","145":"\n\nA party out for WOOD, brought in 4 Turkish Cavalry. One was riding on a Light Horse Saddle which was made in \nMelbourne\n!! I think Joe very ill advised to try & come. Who would look after the Letting of the House & what would become of MOTHER, the Garden etc. etc. Besides surely one is enough. Joe’s responsibilities are more than mine & does he really think he would be doing the right thing coz I don’t. I doubt if JOE FIT any way – the war will be over in a month or so, I’m sorry as I know Joe’s feelings but he would be mad to come.\n","146":"\n\nOUTPOST\n\nIn support at NAGILI, with the naked eye, 100s of Turkscan be seen grazing their horses & gathering in the Harvest. We have just sent a Squadron to set fire to it.\n\nI told the wife she was wrong in going to LONDON for WAR work, plenty about Manchester. Laura only saw her twice in about 3 weeks. Rumoured we are going back a few miles soon for a spell. Some sea bathing would be good for Septic Sores. I am quite alright again now.\n\nWill post this tonight. Thank you Mother dear for your long letters.\n","147":"\n\nFrom","148":" to","149":" missing.\n\n Our H.Q’s were bombed yesterday & NOWELL FORTH’s horse died from wounds on previous day – demoralizing damn thing but a fog last night hid the moon. Still anxiously waiting our turn on the Beach.\n\nScorpions are very plentiful also snakes & the boys going on leave take them to Cairo to amuse!!! the CASINO girls. The Scorpions bite is no worse than a Bull dog ant except when the female is mating – then she eats the male if she gets a chance & will fight anything.\n\nLast night I got a Centipede 8\" long – Cairo is full of snake charmers & jugglers & our boys try to follow suit with sometimes disastrous results.\n","150":"\n\n Laura writes that she has seen my Father in Law’s death in the Paper at home – I have had no Cable so am not worrying too much yet it may be another man – Dolly will feel it. Visited","151":" L.H. & took them down at Bridge last night.\n\nTomorrow a French Cavalry General is to witness the L.H. take a Redoubt – Nowell’s Camels will be on our left, a sort of Field Day showing L.H. doing dismounted duty like Rafa, MAGDHABA over again, but this time no real enemy.\n\nGot some splendid shirts for the men from the L.H. Depot Sydney – most acceptable as the warm weather is here now.\n","152":"\n\nWell we’ve had our Field day & took the positions. Two of our Officers were decorated with Croix de GUERRE etc. & when the French General presented them, he \nkissed\n our hard faced officers who stonily stared in front of them.\n\nAfter, we marched past in clouds of dust & returned to Camp very thirsty.\n\n No cable from Dolly think there must be some mistake – or I would have heard re Father’s death. I have written her, that some of the Officers have been Kissed by more than a French General in Egypt!!\n","153":"\n\nGoing out to \nSHAM\n fight our Scouts put up a Jackal, I let a Troop go & we ran him down in great style – the same sort of animal we used to get in S. Africa. Coming home I noticed a Bedouin child cutting up young PRICKLY PEAR & feeding 2 Camels on it. The SPINES were soft but quite strong enough to stick in our mouths – yet the Camel was fat.\n\nTook the Squadron to the Beach & paid them there, the swim did them all a world of good - \naltho’ I did not go to Church Parade I thought of you little Mother.\n","154":"\n\nHere’s one – a subaltern of the 7 L.H. wanted to buy some fowls from Bedouin – unable to talk clapped his arms & crowed. MEN on return to Camp would flap arms & crow whenever he came into lines (not being too popular). Later a Patrol brought in a Rooster & kept him alive till next day. Rooster crowed at dawn, shout from dug-out \"STOP that row\". Again Cock crowed \"STOP that row\" from the 1 dug-out. Then one of the Stable Picket rushed at the rooster with Bayonet saying \"I’ll cut your b- head off if you crow again\" don’t you hear the Officers order!! The men are great wags & generally score.\n","155":"\n\nNow that stirrups IRONS & BITS have to be brightened, it is no easy job after 3 years of rusting. However the boys rose to the occasion & found that the SODA Tablets issued to CHLORINATE the drinking water were excellent, the M.O. wonders at the demand!! so suddenly. As a rule the men drink the first water they find if dry & worry not about germs.\n\nIt is an exploded idea the deadliness of SCORPIONS, men get bitten almost daily & beyond a big swelling for the whole of the time & a sick feeling, they carry on – not pleasant I’ll admit but we thought at first would be more serious.\n","156":"\n\nLast night a terrific bombardment went on on our left. The SKY was bright with Flares & SHELLS bursting – result an important forward position of Johnnie Turkstaken.\n\n\"Camels\" had a day’s sports & Carnival & Concert in the evening. \nI went & saw Nowell, he’s a great man among the English Aristocracy now – LORDS & ragged EARLS, etc:\n One item \na\n Musical Chairs by mounted Camels was screamingly funny – Camels are riden in a circle, bags on ground at intervals, on the Band stopping, Camels are made to sit on nearest bag.\n\n BEER night again & many have yet to learn \"How much they can carry\". Broken noses & more SKIN off the result.\n","157":"\n\nGetting warmer each week & the men are in SHORTS again, they were issued with Helmets last year but so many floated down the Canal we have been allowed to keep our HATS this year.\n\nJust recd. word of Father-in-law’s death, enclose cutting he left everything in = Shares to Dolly & his son Capt. ISH. His wife NIL, nor does he mention me, but the Will was made in March 1916, I have a Copy – don’t I know total but he was a wealthy man so Dolly is well provided for.\n\nWill post this at once. Love to all.\n","158":"\n\n You may be surprised to hear that my old nickname of JERRY has never been allowed to die. Tommy Radford started it again & NOWELL uses it. I got it first at \nMrs. BATEMANS\n. It is a relief to me to know that DOLLY is now provided for. I do not know how much but she has her own home, Furniture etc. & several hundreds a year at least – ISH gave 5000\/-\/- to relative, but entailed the rest for SON & daughter in equal shares. Have written you fully.\n\nNear here is a SHEIKH’s Tomb, as in the present so in the past, notable men had large monuments – these are dome shaped & painted white by mashing up the PRICKLY PEAR Cactus leaves & mixing with water. Good landmarks to take compass bearings on.\n","159":"\n\n Lost a horse last night & found him in Camel Officers lines – one of our men had been promised a carton of whisky for a Horse. To such a state have morals sunk but Officers!! should not encourage such jobbery.

Dust continuous & the Beach seems afar off.\n","160":"\n\nVisited General Meredith and old O\/C & one time the Bushmen’s Medical Officer in S.A.\n\nRe losing Horses one gets funny descriptions in Orders sometimes, such as \"Bay Geld, an old steeple-chasers \nso should be easily recognized\n\", another, \"Brown Geld etc. \na little wild\n\" - this from the Tommies lines & Orders. Expect to move to Beach tomorrow at last. Did not go to Church as a howling Dust Storm blew all the afternoon & we have lost our good old Padre who is now a Major & at DivisionAL Hd. Qts.\n","161":"\n\nBEACH\n\nI’ve had a swim & built a Bivy facing the Mediteranean just 60 yards from the waves – it is a treat to be clean again & the horses should improve here. They have been falling away for the last month. No grazing & too many Flies DUST & not enough water. My two are still fit & well & not a blemish on them altho’ they have some weight to carry. \nOld\n Colonel Granville left today sick – we have only ¼ of the evacuations the Tommies have among the men. Our men spend all their money on TUCKER.\n","162":"\n\n\"RAMADAN\"\n\nRAMADAN, 1 month of fasting for the Turksby day & all MOSLEMS tomorrow. They must not even drink water but they have a great spread at sundown & feed all night & if we let them will sleep by day.

I get 2 a day & enjoying them. \"Bombing\" Classes are now popular as the sea coast swarms with fish & one bomb well thrown into a shoal returns many. Did you get a MILLS BOMB I sent by Pearse of the Comforts Fund. I told him to leave it at McKinson & Lavenders office, Sydney - nil load. Had dinner with the Gunners a SOMERSET BATTERY.\n","164":"\n\nSpeaking of Comforts Fund reminds me that the Depot at KANTARA has been burnt down which is bad luck.

Those wearying music lessons were worth it all, to be able to strum now.\n\nGeneral \nChauvel\n who has the Division & one time our BRIGADIER inspected us carefully this morning. He looks \nto\n older as we all do & shall do if the end does not come soon. Our Rest!!! will be up in a week then back to the front line again.\n\nSODA TABLETS & the issued RAW LIME JUICE pushed us through by taking the rust off IRONS, BITS etc.\n","165":"\n\nI hear an Australian mail is in but letters take longer of late & some say they leave Australia via America for Egypt, what a touch. I enclose you snapshots of my Horse the one HLA bought from Harrison.

We have now a PLAGUE OF CRICKETS – 100s of them in every Bivy, supposed to be good luck aren’t they? Lets hope so. Went to Church Parade but owing to the roar of the surf could hear nothing. \nI thought of you, bravely walking home from the old Church in D’quin.\n","168":"\n\n The Bathing has done the men a lot of good. Septic Sores are healing fast. Managed to get 26 pairs of Boots but they want HATS & Riding Pants badly.

We were only in Camp long enough to fill our NOSE BAGS & get some Tucker & off again – \"Taubes\" killed a few New Zealanders with bombs.

Two of our Secret Agents came thro’ our lines. Dressed as Bedouins they showed the Officers where they carried their messages etc. & also took off Turbans & exhibited 5 or 6 Turkish sovereigns. After satisfying myself they were genuine I gave them a Pass sent them on to D.H.Q.\n\nImagine my surprise when I was rung up on Telephone & accused of taking a Turkish Sovereign from one of the Agents.

In FRANCE no doubt they have plenty.\n","227":"\n\nAn Australasian JUNE arrived & no doubt letters are following. Am afraid many of mine were sunk in the MONGOLIA. On the Range again. I found a Reinforcement who had \nnever loaded or fired a Rifle yet\n. One of the men took a snapshot of me shooting in a GAS MASK, not easy as a mist covers the eye pieces from breathing.\n\nNo news yet re leave. None of the family ever complain about the increased cost of things or servants etc. I know your PENNIES can’t go far these days & you are all doing your BIT.\n","228":"\n\n*GHARRY\n\nLeave Party are back from Port Said. The men were very full up of things going down. \nLectured by so many Officers, so many Orders & OUT OF BOUNDS, etc.\n but they enjoyed their spell. As one of them said, \"the sight of one pretty woman driving in a *\"GHARRY\" was worth the trip & Lectures after so long in the Desert.\n\nInoculated again for Para TYPHOID, CHOLERA etc. I forget how many this is. Thanks for Grazier with RALPH ANDERSON & JOCK ELLIS notices, poor chaps but sooner go out in a fight than by Disease. This is a healthy spot facing into BIVY. I can see TRAWLERS sweeping mines off GAZA. I am only 100 yards from the Sea.\n","229":"\n\nBomb practice & Hotchkiss gun Class & GAS DRILL, pity something could not eventuate out of GAS to Kill SCRUB, Prickly Pears & RABBITS.\n\nI read the new AWU arrived with interest. I & the wife can get a job as married Boundary Riders somewhere I hope \"Apres la guerre finis\". Tonight BOXING. Brigadier General RYRIE acts as Referee & gives the boys a fair go.\n\nFeel a bit DOPEY from inoculation but a great deal fitter all round for my spell in Hospital.\n","230":"\n\nLost a leaf so put in an October one for today.\n\nSuch a Treat my mail arrived. JOE, DAY 8\/7\/17, MOTHER LAURA, WIFE & sprig of \"WATTLE\" did I ever quote you some lines published in JO’BURG STAR S.A., \"The scent of the WATTLE round LICHTENBURG Oh CHRIST my country again\".\n\nSorry for JOE re enlisting but glad in many ways – \"Angels can do no more\" & must read letters again.\n","231":"\n\nLeave granted 3 weeks in England – I will cable from Cairo . \"Convalescent 6 weeks leave England\" it will take 3 travelling. I am so thankful – don’t know boat till I report. I go ITALY & FRANCE so if not torpedoed a splendid trip. I am certainly a very lucky man & will Cable you my arrival in England.\n\nIt just happened our Brigade is doing nothing hence I got leave & a lot may happen in 6 weeks. Love to you. I’m saddling up now!!!\n","232":"\n\nCairo . Personal.\n\nHere I am again at Continental. Stored KIT at Gezireh – sent Cables to you, Mother & the wife saying \"I’m off first boat\". Got Circular NOTES from Thos. Cook & Co. for use en route, reported at A.I.F. Headquarters for instructions & PAPERS & now await Orders to report to Embarkation Office, Alexandria - \nno\n information is given to anyone, as to when or what boats are to sail. Rang up NOWELL & asked him to dine with me tonight. He’s at ABBASSIA, a suburb in charge of Camel BASE CAMP.\n","233":"\n\nNo word re boat yet. I would of course like to go to Australia & see you all, but am considered very lucky in getting to England. \nAll today have been interviewing Red + Commissioner & Commandant re getting DOLLY to come back with me to Cairo .\n Nowell did not turn up but came for breakfast he has a cold, but is better today. I go to see him tomorrow. All my friends want to know \"How I worked it to get home\".\n","234":"\n\nStill HOT in Cairo .\n\nI am quite busy deciding what KIT to take & what to leave behind. The days are Hot here but cold in England I expect.\n\nHad lunch with Nowell at Camel Corps Mess – he is better & goes out to his Regiment tomorrow.\n\nWe looked at many old photos of \"Carrakoorte\" & other places. Nowell gave me photo of 2 young Lion Cubs he \nis taking\n took to England from Abyssinia the last time he went HOME.\n","235":"\n\nCairo \n\nDisappointed \ntoday\n again to find \nno\n boat available for about a fortnight \nso cabled Dolly not to expect me till end of month.\n Meantime we applied to go to a School \"Topographical or Senior Cavalry\" \nas I cannot afford to be living here in Cairo at the Continental as many expense is ahead of me in my trip home.\n\nI am very happy about it all. Will travel light & am leaving a leather KIT Bag at the Continental Hotel here others at Gezireh so if torpedoed you’ll know.\n","236":"\n\nCairo \n\nAgain to G.H.Q. I may yet get away on Sunday next – but nothing definite. \n\nApplication granted for Dolly to come out so hope all will be well better the Winter in Egypt than at Home.\n\nAm afraid I’m spending a lot of L.S.D. in all this but as we earned it, still I’m not helping at home much. I did think Jack would be paying interest to you all these years. Thank you for looking after Insurance.\n","237":"\n\nCairo \n\nStill marking time. Nowell had dinner last night with me & he told me he had a Reinforcement to the Camels of a man by name TOM KIDNEY!!! who was educated at the Warrnambool College – that was a few years ago. Was it not Kidney who said he was late for School coz he had to stand \"to attention\" as the Band played God Save the Queen & so he missed his train!! Mrs. Davis Red X superintendent is sending for me some BASKETS made from NILE REEDS by natives of ASSUAN, do you for Work Baskets etc. if you ever get them.\n","238":"\n\nCairo \n\nWaiting & Hoping. The Turkshave a proverb viz, \"Power over the Water hath ALLAH given to the intercessor but \nover the land\n to the faithful\" – strange people. I lost my book altho’ I turned the Hotel servants upside down for it – \"They only said it was the \"Will of ALLAH\". Went to Church with Nowell. Later on to a Carnival of Flowers & Confetti in some Gardens here a Fete for the French.\n\nWe also had our \"caricatures\" done for 40 P.T. I am posting you mine in a TIN TUBE & hope it arrives safely.\n","239":"\n\nNowell is staying here for a few days he is better & I’ve seen a good deal of him. He is a philosopher & the Orient has entered his soul a good deal. Have decided to go to Alexandria tomorrow so will post this with some snapshots I have had printed. My last information is NO BOAT for a week. \nLove to you all, Frank.\n","240":"\n\nAlexandria\n\nArrived 7.30 p.m. Spent the morning with Nowell at the ZOO \nand posted you my notes and some snap-shots.\n I hear the Mediteranean is alive with PORPOISES of the TIN FISH variety but am sure my luck will take me over alright.\n\nI’m a bit scared at the idea of Dolly travelling & would take a job at home if I got the offer.\n\nAnyway I’m having a good holiday now & my only worry is the waste of good L.S.D. Regina Hotel is my new place of abode. It is quite cool here.\n","241":"\n\nAlex\n\nDaily Telegraph Aug. 23 an English Paper has a good article by Mazzly on the MOSAIC I mentioned we found at Shedal. I shall cut out & post but mention as so many letters are lost these days. The Cotton Crop is ripe again in Egypt & the Mills busy, a regulation is in force limiting the amount grown as the \"Fellahin\" would grow all cotton & so starve the country of cereals. \nFound letters from Dolly & Laura up to Aug. 21 – former was very sad at my not getting any leave, my cable had not then been received.\n","242":"\n\nAlex\n\nStill no word of a boat. There are hundreds of officers including 4 Generals waiting for a passage. It is very disappointing still, I must not growl. 12 stone 10½ I weigh now so nothing much wrong. \nRumour has it that the 1914 men may get leave to Australia next year. The New Zealanders are getting theirs now.\n Russian news today again bad, I wonder how much is true. It should be nearly the middle of NOVEMBER before I am back in the firing line & much may happen ere then who knows. My Bronchitis is now CHRONIC & I cannot stand the DUST.\n","243":"\n\nAlex\n\nThe old ship Aragon our G.H.Q. ship at Gallipoli was recently here – it would be a coincidence if I sailed in her.\n\nToday I & 2 other officers went to Stanley Bay for a swim & in the afternoon to the Yatch Club for tea.\n\nStill no word as to embarking & altho’ I am enjoying the spell I am naturally impatient to be off. This town is of course darkened at night & I had to sign a certificate that I alone would be responsible if a light were shown from my window in Hotel.\n","244":"\n\nAlex\n\nWent to the Races & lost my good gold but had a lot of fun. One gets into a crowd of officers of all Regiments here \n& must go along with them. Still no word of a boat so one of our Majors have been recalled to his Regiment, we are afraid this may happen to more of us.\n\nAs I have told you before the Totalisator & Starting gate are used & most of the horses are grey stallions (Arab). \n\n\"Quail\" are landing all along the coast & the Natives catch them easily poor beggars being very tired after their fly across the Mediteranean. Too tired to make good shooting.\n","245":"\n\nAlex:\n\nHad a letter from Dolly but none from home yet. Some of the photos I sent Dolly she returned the Censor having put them through a Bath blotting the whole lot. I hope what I send you are not so treated.. Everyone tells me I’m looking very fit again again, anyway I’m having an easy wait but am naturally very impatient at the delay.\n\nIntend going St. Marks Church near Matron Aly’s Club at 10.50 this morning.\n","246":"\n\nAlex:\n\nToday I spent at the MOUZAM Gardens, & in the Orchid house. Alexandria is having one of their best \"seasons\", all Greeks etc. have made much money & spend it on clothes etc. - & jewellery. Every Hotel & Pension is full \nfrom\n of people from the interior or far away as the Soudan. \n\nLetter from Dolly today dated Aug. 30th. She did not know I’m on my way home. I was never so impatient at delay & for two pins I’d go into some Camp for duty but a few hours notice is all we get. Am reading Romany Rye & getting a lot of letters written I owe.\n","247":"\n\nAlex:\n\nAm posting you the figure of a Native, drawn by a Cotton Merchant friend of mine, from life. \nI wish I could send you some for Servants. I am sure poor old Day is weary of House keeping without proper help. She has done her BIT.\n\nThe horses here are terrible crocks & are cruelly used. You hear the story of putting a small eel down a horse’s throat to make him lively well all this is \ndown\n done by the Jelins here & many worse things besides.\n","248":"\n\nAlex:\n\nNow Friday is given as the day we may get a boat. No boy ever looked forward to his Xmas Holidays as keenly as I do to this journey home. I will post this the day I sail - \nit will be 2 weeks from date my leave was granted – however it is better than the Front line & I’m not a bit keen to return there at present whatever I may be later on.\n My Bronchitis is chronic & I get bad fits of coughing, a dry climate away from the sea is the one that agrees with me.\n","249":"\n\nAlex:\n\nWent to the BOURSE or Cotton Exchange to see Cotton sold not unlike our WOOL SALES. The row that is made in foreign languages. Cotton prices are booming & Egyptian Cotton is the best grown in the world.\n\nLast night a dance was given at the Hotel & I joined in, the foreign girls all dance beautifully, wear nice frocks but a bit overdressed when they undress for a Ball. Usual English dances Waltz, One Step & Fox Trot - \nmen in boots & no gloves\n.\n","250":"\n\nAlex:\n\nStill waiting.\n\nWent for a long walk to an old fort built before even the Romans came, I’m not much at Antiquities but these places are of interest. Alexandria is a very old seaport of the Mediteranean. Two boats little one went today but only \nduty\n men go in them \non duty passengers have to wait.\n\nYesterday was the Italian National Fete day & Bands etc. occupied the Streets. We went to the KURSAAL & saw TROVADORE by Italians. They are a handsome race of people.\n","251":"\n\nAlex:\n\nVery disappointed probably will not get away till next month so post this today.\n\nAll my letters have gone on to England but I should not growl the expense is what annoys me so unwarranted still I do not lose my seniority with the Regiment & many would give much to be in my shoes. Love to all – Frank.\n\nSaturday 22nd September\n\nWent to Fencing School this morning, all the young Italian & French Bloods go in for it here but never BOX.\n\nI have been made an Hon. member of UNION & Mohammed Aly Clubs & meet a number of people – but this does not get over my impatience.\n\nPosted notes yesterday but they are only of interest to the family I think. How different this life to that of Clare Station!!!! but I \nnever\n forget. Went to Races & paid my expenses then on to San Stefano as a guest to dinner & the usual HOTEL dance.\n","252":"\n\n Cancelled.\n\nI bought this book some time ago thinking I would not want it but I hope to keep going to the finish now.\n\nWent Y.M.C.A. to Church. The usual ranting Yankee type of preacher these places go in for. I get on well with the native servants here as I address them all as \"MOHAMMED\". Am reading \"The way of an Eagle\", E. Dell & trying to forget – but its desperate this waiting. Now I’m told Thursday next – others say Oct. 2. I’ve had to cable again to the little wife explaining delay. No Australian mails for weeks & weeks now.\n","253":"\n\nWent for a long walk to MEX where Napolean landed when he took Alexandria. I had for company an A.I.F. Priest, who talked a lot of the coming Revolution in England!!!! I wonder is he right. He also decided that the masses of labourites would insist on peace before another Winter War.\n\nI sleep for 2 hours after lunch & so the day is put thro’ waiting waiting – a great waste of time & money but a good change & but for my Bronchitis I would be A.1.\n","254":"\n\nTelephone – affords a lot of amusement when used by the Foreigners in the Hotel – they must gesticulate all the time, & this is difficult with one hand engaged.\n\nToday I’m told I’ll get a boat on Thursday but I do not build on anything till I actually embark. Went to the sporting Club & had Tea etc. The Greek & Italian & French women all dress very daintily but one should not see them eat. No mail from Australia for 6 weeks now.\n","255":"\n\nIf my Bronchitis is no better I shall try & get \"boarded\" for Australia from England, others are doing it so why should not I. Of course I hardly expect such luck but I \ndon’t\n want to go back at present. I may feel different after being away another month. \n\nMy Papers came today & I’m really off tomorrow, all very secret & no name of boat mentioned. I shall be glad of the chance of seeing something of ITALY. Left Alex Sept. 27 wire Cable on arrival.\n\nLove to all – it will be a fortnight ere I reach my destination.\n F.W. Private –","256":"\n\nFriday 28th September\n\nCame aboard yesterday & was given an excellent State room on the old Gallipoli boat \n\"ARAGON\"\n which was G.H.Q.’s ship at LEMNOS. My mate is a man \nGunner Major\n who travelled from England in the ill-fated HUNTSEND last November. We have 200 odd officers & some SISTERS on board. \nI only paid 6\/6 a day, indulgence passage for a first class passage to ? Europe.\n We don’t know as a matter of fact whether we go to ITALY or MARSEILLE yet – only the Admiralty knows as plenty of TIN FISH about these days. We hope to reach LONDON by","257":" with luck. \nThe little wife will find the days long I’m afraid.\n Of course we live in life belts once more & are escorted by T.B.D. etc:- quite a flotilla sailed out of Alex. tonight at 5 p.m.\n","258":"\n\n I did not hear any good news of he is a Sergeant in Flying Corps, but drinks far too much & is spending his L.S.D. too – in Cairo & would be well out of that place.\n\nThis boat was on the Argentine run & all the notices for Passengers are printed in Spanish in addition to English.\n\nCalm Sea & every comfort, a destroyer racing along on each side of us & sometimes describing a circle round.\n\n I’m wearing JOE’s a leather waist coat under my Tunic as a \"Greve\" or Air Waistcoat in place of the clumsy life belt – no one has noticed the difference from an air one & I can swim.\n","259":"\n\nWe go direct to \nTaranto\n. I think the journey by rail is a pretty rough one & a \ngang of International thieves go through your baggage. Some nurses recently lost everything – but that is a condition of active service one gets used to.\n\nAttended Church & then made one of our Officers Submarine Guard as only a few men on board, the duty was too heavy for them. Temperature falling daily. \nDear little Mother, if you were only coming to meet Dolly too, but some day soon I hope we will be back in N.S.W.\n","260":"\n\nWe travel along a lane like a T.S.R. & should arrive at TARANTO opposite BRINDISI at 5 p.m.\n\nThe destroyers who accompany us dodge about in front or on a flank like a good sheep dog working a single sheep. If anything suspicious is seen a cloud of smoke is put around us. Another 5 hours & we will have run the gauntlet successfully. My health has improved so much that my nerves are better than they have been for a long time. We saw one submarine quite plainly on our Starboard bow.\n","261":"\n\nMy Wedding day\n\nArrived 5 p.m. last night & hung up, flying \"Yellow\" Flag only 1 c\/- Dysentery on board, but we are \nnot popular\n at present in this port for various reasons I cannot write of.\n\nThe bay is full of shipping Hydro planes Submarines & Battleships. The Italians are very frightened we may bring Cholera from Palestine. Even our drinking water on the Steamer is supposed to be Chlorinated, but the Chief Officer always shows the Medical men the \nengine\n Tank & thus we escape & the M.O.s are satisfied.\n","262":"\n\nTARANTO\n\nStill flying \"Yellow Flag\" – one will be like ENOCH ARDEN ere England is reached.\n\nAlongside an ITALIAN Battleship is practising with her big guns – shaking us from stem to stern – a dirigible Balloon spotting for the guns, flies overhead. This is a wonderful harbour the opening no more than a street wide with many storied houses built to waters edge, & the shipping is hidden by the Houses. The days drag on & I’m very hungry to get on our journey. \nPost this ITALY.\n","263":"\n\nStill hung up – we expected to get away today, now tomorrow - & it is no use being impatient on active service. The ships come & \ndown\n go, through the Street as \nit\n appears of \nTARANTO\n - not unlike the scene in a comic Opera, where a big boat comes on the Stage. Beautiful sunsets & still warm I am glad to say. Did not get off hope to do so tomorrow.\n\nConvoys of French & Italian troops go out each evening escorted by T.B.D.’s of different nations, the men are dressed in the Slate Blue uniforms of the Continent.\n\nNo war news. Posted notes from TARANTO.\n","264":"\n\nStill on board, a week today – but we hope to disembark at noon – travelling is not easy in War time \n& the \tYELLOW JACK makes it more difficult.\n\n5 miles by Tug to a Rest Camp then we carried our own luggage to the train with rations & water. Got off at 8 p.m. 5 Officers in a compartment. I slept on the floor. All along Adriatic Coast the same foliage as Peninsular viz., Olives, etc. Women on duty at Cross roads & in the fields.\n","265":"\n\n1,000 One thousand miles by rail through ITALY then another 600 through France (about). We expect to be 8 days on the train, so I will not be in England by the 10th. No tucker is available at any town we pass, but fruit & vegetables in plenty can be seen. We travel very slowly only burn Briquettes & little coal but we are going in the right direction. When we pull up at a Town or Station guards are put all around the train \nas riots have occurred at some places.\n","266":"\n\nThe Olives & Vines give way to Wheat & then very pretty hilly country. Spent half today at \nFERANZE\n an out of the way old pretty town, \ncabled Dolly\n. We found a mineral Bath (thermos) & bought eggs, Chianti, fruit etc. - Cobble stones Cathedrals & Pottery.\n\nBoarded the train at 7.45 p.m. again. All day we passed Castles on the hills & could hear the big guns on the Austrian border. TRAIN fumigated & disinfected here.\n","267":"\n\nHalted at \nVOGHERA\n after travelling all night, had a wash & breakfast. It is a great struggle to get any rest as the carriages are full & no sleepers. We get Army Rations issued, but buy CHIANTI, eggs, etc. & a very good sparkling wine SPUMATI which is cheap. 34250 LIRE go to the English pound. At \nTURIN\n we halted for 2 hours & went to the town, bought a bird & \nbottle\n for tea. The Alps are all around & covered with Snow, a pretty spot – Electric train from here.\n","268":"\n\nChanged \ntrains\n Engines at \nMODERN\n on the border after passing through MONT CENIS Tunnel. This tunnel takes half an hour to go through, & the scenery is very good.\n\nHad breakfast at \nMONT MELIAN\n with the Alps all around us – cold but interesting. Changed LIRES into Francs – fortunately the Railway is the same guage & we have not to change our carriages.\n","269":"\n\nThe French are most enthusiastic & friendly \nnot like the south of ITALY\n. I drank VIVE (a France in Vin Ordinaire with some French Officers at \nAix la Bains\n a pretty spot near a Lake \nLac de Bourget\n - it is autumn here & the foliage is like Macedon. Some Boches were on a platform under guard. Every child woman & man of France between 8 & 80 years of age is working. Arrived \nSt. Germain\n au Mont d’or on Rhone & stayed the night at Hotel Restaurant du Sport & it was \"du Sport\".\n","270":"\n\nOn board Train again. Left \nLYON\n at 11.30 a.m. All money is paper here even down to 1 Franc piece = 8D or 9D. Each Municipality issues their own War notes. Here we saw a delightful smash along a picturesque canal with tow boats. Still in the train tonight. France is very pretty just now, apple trees loaded with fruit & the Hawthorn hedges red with berries as we travel slowly on out of the way lines. We see the countryside mostly.\n","271":"\n\nHad breakfast at Le Mans on Station here – passed many American Soldiers in trains – felt hatted & cheerful.

We did not \narrive\n land too rough & had to put back & tranship from the \n\"Queen Alexandria\"\n to the \n\"Antrim\"\n a bigger boat – all night we were buffeted about, the Channel very rough. We make another attempt tonight. No Cabins last night & no tucker, but I have a cabin tonight & am on shore at Cherbourg now, sitting down to a good dinner. It’s a big undertaking travelling in wartime.\n","273":"\n\nShopped & pd. up Bills of Dollys & danced in Hotel in evening. Fox trots & only 2 one steps & 1 Waltz. I’m not much good at the first – a splendid band & good floor & Dolly is a perfect little dancer, & looks so pretty & such a youngster, you would not think she was married. Raining & snow. We get plenty of Tucker but one has to pay 100 % more for everything & I could not keep up this pace.\n","274":"\n\nWrote letters, breakfast in bed every morning. At Midland Hotel, every Room had Telephone alongside bed, Clock illuminated over door & fresh fish kept in a pond to chose as you liked. Luxury if you like.

ISHERWOOD & his wife arrived from Norwich, the former is a little man, the wife big, we went to Trocadero for Dinner & on to see \"General Post\" at the Haymarket.\n\nHad Laura to afternoon tea to meet the Isherwoods.\n","289":"\n\nToday I took the Isherwoods to the Australian Club for Lunch & afterwards to the Australia House in the Strand & saw the Lord Mayors Procession, had afternoon tea with the High Commissioner, Andy Fisher!!! in the evening dinner at the Carlton & went to see CHU CHIN CHOW.\n\nIt worries me spending all this money but it cannot be helped at present.\n\nGood news from GAZA in the Papers but ITALY!!!!\n","290":"\n\nThis morning went shopping with Aldy to GAMAGES a great Store for TOYS etc:- Had lunch at \"Frascatis\" & then saw them off home again to NORFOLK. Laura rings up, she is to go into a Private Hospital on Tuesday for some minor operation, nothing serious though she says.\n\nCold better but the days are very bitter. I may try & see the Droys next week if I don’t go away.\n","291":"\n\nLunch Laura at 1.30 at her Flat – she is always on the go somewhere & so never fattens. Dr. JAGGER sends her for an operation on Tuesday Tonsils to be cut, & she goes to a nursing home for a week, more expense for her. I read Day’s letter of September & glad to hear alls well at home & you have been to Wangaratta. Can you tell me if that LOCOMOTIVE toy of Joe’s is at Bronte. Laura & I were talking about it today.\n","292":"\n\nSee Mrs. Wilkins after reporting A.I.F. 10 a.m. Another week to wait & we sail \ntogether\n on a boat straight from London Docks on or about --- so I shall be with the little wife.\n\nPosting this to let you know my movements. Love to all, F.\n","293":"\n\nPosted notes yesterday – telling you I’m here till 19th. Laura comes at 2.30 to see us, & goes Hospital tonight.\n\nBrace is coming to see her & she says Connie is ill too but Laura is a bit of a Hypochondriac if that spells it correctly.\n\nFoggy morning my cold better & the wife very fit. A luxurious life at present.\n\nIn Palestine several of my friends have been killed.\n","294":"\n\nCapt. Brace came round to Berners Hotel & told us Laura was O.K. I went Waterloo & shifted Baggage to P. & O. & then entertained 3 of Dollys friends at the Australian Club, not my pleasure but theirs, am glad to see our men are doing so well in Palestine & feel I should be there. Here the Restaurants & Theatres are always crowded with a pleasure loving well-dressed crowd, even on air-raid nights.\n","295":"\n\nKelman dinner\n\nTook seats for Dolly & self at Royal for Billeted.\n\nHad lunch at the Club & took rest of luggage to P. & O. Office.\n\nLaura doing well & she has lots of friends who have taken her Flowers & Fruit. We all hope she will be stronger after this.\n\nFoggy days & nights now.\n\nHave read your letter of 23\/9\/17 to Laura & also one of Aunt Lowes. I hope you will go to Melbourne at Xmas again.\n","296":"\n\n\"Boy\" at the Adelphi tonight.\n\nWent early to Laura’s Hospital & took her some Carnations – 6 Pink, 6 White – cost 5\/-!!!, give you an idea of value here.\n\nLaura could talk but her throat was sore. Met Brace & young Charlie at Liverpool Railway Station & went theatre tonight with Dolly – as you must think am not saving much L.S.D.\n","297":"\n\nRed X wife – watch at Porter & Smith.\n\nFound I had to pay 55\/-\/- passage money self & wife!!! I anticipated the Red X would pay her fare.\n\nThen visited Laura at the Hospital, she is getting on well. I saw a good deal of young Charlie yesterday, we had lunch together & he is a bonny boy & I think will look after his Mother. Brace is in London but I don’t see much of him.\n","298":"\n\nWent & saw Laura who is getting on well. Then I went & had lunch with the Cottons, the wife going to some friends Capt. Riddles. Laura will be up tomorrow, she gave me your letter of Sept. 9th & JOES, a long interesting letter of Home news. We are off tomorrow so post this.\n\nWith love from both to you dear little Mother.\n\nWe go by all sea route – P. & O. from Tilbury Docks Tomorrow.\n","299":"\n\nEmbarked at noon S.S. \"Malta\" at last. Very careful inspection of PASSPORTS etc:- Went down the Thames & anchored – for night. Not a big ship, & only 8 other women on board. \"Dolly\" wears her Red X Brassard.\n\nBoat drill etc., we are at the Doctor’s Table for meals.\n\nAll luggage safe on board, thank goodness! I believe we have several hundred barrels of gunpowder also so we should have a good lift if hit.\n","300":"\n\nMoved on to DEAL & anchored there.\n\nPassed a big lineR with stern blown in & being driven by TUGS.\n\nWe have at our table a Capt. HURLEY who has been twice to the Pole, & has been on the French salient photographing & is now en route to Palestine.\n\nCold & foggy.\n\nThe tucker is good & no restrictions like in England. All the Stewards are Indians & we have passengers for ports as far as Japan.\n","301":"\n\nAnchored off Portland or Weymouth since early morning – the same spot the HOS: ship S.S. \"LETITIA: anchored 1 year ago – she is now down in Halifax - . We have passengers for Mesopotamia, Bombay, China, Colombo & Port Said – 7 women all told mostly nurses.\n\nGot a Paper today & I see our men are close to Jerusalem.\n\nWell I’m out of it for the present anyway.\n","302":"\n\nDuring the night we came on to PLYMOUTH. Our skipper tells us we passed 2 subs!! but too dark to see us – so alls well.\n\nPosted letters to Laura & Mrs. ISH.\n\nThe \"camouflage\"? on the boats is most quaint. With glasses the banding of paint put on in curves shows better than straight lines. Ships painters have certainly been allowed full play to their imagination. Our crew are a cross of Portugese & Indian & the Stewards excellent fellows. \n","303":"\n\nStill anchored at PLYMOUTH, cold but safe, we got some papers & heard of the success of BYNG’s push \nnear St. QUENTIN\n & our men at Jerusalem. Passengers thawing a little, beginning to speak to each other. At my table is an American Engineer with a terrific drawl & a Mining Engineer & I spoke of the POLAR man before so we talk on all subjects. But no REUTER news. \nThe P. & O. are too mean to subscribe & altho’ we have wireless no news is posted on SALOON.\n","304":"\n\nMoved out at 10 a.m. in a Convoy with 20 others & escorted by destroyers.\n\nFairly rough & the little Lady is not so happy as usual - & is in bed. Mother I hope you have had my letters from Alexandria – my next will be from Cairo – D.V.\n\nPassed the Eddystone Light House quite closely, could see people on the turret. We go I believe a long way out of our course but the longest way round is the shortest way home.\n","305":"\n\nToo rough for any one to know it is Sunday.\n\nI was ill for the first time in many years, the result of attending the wife, who hopes the boat will be torpedoed etc:- As a matter of fact one of the Convoy nearly ran us down in the afternoon, we could almost step on board each other, through careless steering.\n\nMoon is quite good now, but we hope we are miles from any subs.\n","306":"\n\nCalmer & wife happy & we are now moving a bit south – to a warmer climate I hope. This is an old boat 27 years & a lucky one so we hope for the best though our loading is all ammunition, so if we are hit, up goes the balloon.\n\nThe little wife is better but the world has been very black the last few days. I hope my bad writing will sicken the Censor when he gets as far as this.\n","307":"\n\nSkipper says good news came through on the Marconi last night, he will not say \"what\" so must wait patiently till Malta is reached.\n\nClear fine day & a calm sea once more. Do you remember me telling you of my voyage this time last year when we were nearly wrecked off the USHANT ROCKS.\n\nOur Convoy now numbers 14, & more boats will leave us tomorrow – I write more than is good for others than you Mother to read.\n","308":"\n\nColder this morning – but we should feel thankful to be afloat & also well. I had a hateful nightmare last night. I had let my squadron down in a retirement & I felt all the horror of the bullets around me & I rode away – am I really a cur I wonder – or is it only liver thro’ over eating. 10 days at sea now & only off Portugal. We have men on board who have been torpedoed several times, & their nerves are not of the best. When will it all end I wonder.\n","309":"\n\nI hope these notes will be read by you Mother & no one else but our Captain has been drunk for the past 2 days & was also at Plymouth & Weymouth, it is bad enough travelling under normal conditions but now a man wants all the brains the Almighty ever gave him. The Doctor is of the same type but keeps out of the way, the P. & O. of the old days would not stand this sort of thing. Bright sunshine & warmer.\n","310":"\n\nWord has been passed back from our escort that a sunken wreck is not far off & nine submarines!!! I dreamt last night I heard the crash of a Torpedo & ran out into the passage but as all was quiet I went back to bed not before I had \nthe\n disturbed the wife. She does not know anything about our daily fears & worries & I take good care goings does not reach her.\n\nCarters little Liver Pills may stop the dreams.\n","311":"\n\nSaw 2 whales this morning & these would make a good camouflage for subs. I got the wife up at 4.45 a.m. as we are now in the midst of the vermin, just outside \nGIBRALTAR\n. Other escorts have joined including a \nU.S.A. T.B.D.\n. It is not a good thing to stay long in the BATH \n& other places of convenience with the\n door locked.\n\nI have just been yarning to an Italian Officer he blames his Government for sending the TURIN rioters to the one front, where they fraternized with the enemy & sold ITALY a PUP.\n","312":"\n\nOur American friend showed us his FOB this morning & his wonderful watch. The fob was made of Human Skin. Church Service in the Saloon by the ubiquitis Y.M.C.A. As each day passes & nothing happens one is thankful – one of the Nurses on board wanted to know if we did get through all right would the Insurance Coy. give her back the money she paid on her luggage as premium.\n\nI enclose my last WILL, please acknowledge when writing.\n","313":"\n\nThis is an old ship built 22 years ago & RATS & ANTS are plentiful now that the warmer weather is here. Many of the P. & O. are in use as Hospital boats, Despatch Boats & some are armed as auxiliary cruisers.\n\nAbout 4 p.m. we got a S.O.S. wireless from a submarined boat north of us, but we did not alter our course as the Navy attend to that. Rough again \n& the little wife did not sleep.\n","314":"\n\nLast night at dinner we bumped into something & everyone stood up – it may have been wreckage. This morning at 4 a.m. we got S.O.S. again from a boat in our rear, which had been torpedoed but we seem to be protected too well by our escort. It is moonlight at 4 a.m. Only about 4% of sinkings occur in the dark. Calmer & warmer. \nI’ve written Laura & a few others\n but no use posting to you till we arrive Egypt, \nwill post others Malta\n.\n","315":"\n\nAnother S.O.S. message came \nfrom our rear\n last night about 5 miles away, our BAR Steward is very nervous as he has been torpedoed twice \nin PERSIA & MOOLTAN.\n We arrived however in \nMalta\n at 6 p.m. after going 96 miles past & then circling back again – so tonight \nDolly & I\n we came ashore & had dinner, but the Hotel tucker is not as good as on the boat. \nThe Papers I want to read.\n","316":"\n\nSpent today on Malta. Dolly bought 2\/10\/- worth of Handmade Lace.\n We visited the Cathedral of St. John a beautiful place & after went to the Palace where the Knights of St. John lived. I took tickets for the Opera TOSCA & returned tired out. \nIt is no use trying to save any pennies so Boomly Busted & Co.\n A Torpedoe is on view here that did not explode rather interesting under the circumstances to us.\n","317":"\n\nStill at \nMalta\n & remaining till Saturday. We had trouble in getting here & it looks as hard to get away. The Egyptians some years ago had a small NAVY & they set out for Malta but could not find it!!! returning to Alexandria they said, Malta \"mafish\" which is \ngypsy for\n means \"finish\". Visited the Church of \nBones\n 2500 Skulls & bones of the ancient defenders of Malta are arranged in Tiers in a vault, gruesome!!\n\nMore lace today so the wife should be busy in Cairo with sewing. We have our meals ashore as Dolly likes to get away from the Steamer.\n","318":"\n\nMalta\n still. We visited the underground vaults of grain & forage 7 years supply as Malta has little good \nsoil\n in fact years ago every ship had to buy a certain amount of \nsoil\n as Harbour dues.\n\nThen we went to St. Paul’s Cathedral in the old Capital 8 miles by rail. Cette Vecchia or NOTABILE or MEDINA according to the Arab reign or Spain. The Paintings & Marble Statuary etc. is beyond anything I have ever seen. Not least interesting was one of the Silver Crosses of the Crusaders brought from Jerusalem.\n\nOutside the Children were making the Malta lace, with PINS & wooden bobbins, a quaint country of BELLS, SMELLS, & YELLS. Many Churches & much cruelty to animals. \nWent Opera again Rigoletto.\n","319":"\n\nMalta\n\nPosted notes yesterday at Malta & cabled Laura we had got this far safely – still at Malta. Ask JOE to post me a small tin of LIGMOline, I still have the rash – at intervals.\n\nWe are waiting for a convoy to escort us as a large boat was struck this morning \nfrom British W. India. Wife & I\n We went for a long tram ride to see an old submarine on the shore near here. A 3 Card man tried to get me to play on the top of the tram, but I am not a tenderfoot.\n","320":"\n\nMalta\n still, I don’t mind as we are able to see so much of interest here.\n\nFour of us went to a \"Maltese\" Hotel & had a Fish & Spaghetti dinner. Malta is a cheap place to live in. Cold & rough weather, we are glad to be going to Egypt & wish Laura would come. Parties have been digging up Flint arrow heads among the Tombs, Phoenicians, Greeks, ROMANS, ARABS, all had their day. I wonder if this is England’s swan song.\n","321":"\n\nMalta\n just heard that Jerusalem has been taken am sorry I was not there \nbut perhaps it is just as well.\n The real reason why we are delayed is \"subs\" outside. However at 4 p.m. we left with our usual escort after a week at Malta.\n\nLast night a \nBritish W. Indies\n Boat was wrecked by the gale & 30 lives lost – it is a game of hide & seek to get away from Malta but we dodged the subs by going all round.\n","322":"\n\nCalm & smooth, only 2 steamers in convoy we are never lonely with small escort – my 3 weeks leave in England has run into a long space. RATS are plentiful & the Goanese get \na bonus\n for all they kill each day. Goanese are really Portugese settled on an island near India. \nAs soldiers they are not worth much altho’ our allies.\n","323":"\n\nDid practice shooting with our 6\" gun astern & also Howitzers at floating branches it is a novelty for P. & O. passengers. Start to pack up tomorrow, I’m rather tired of this wandering & living in \"bags\", expect I’ll turn up at home some day.\n\nAbout 12 passengers get off at Port Said some for Soudan & other parts.\n","324":"\n\nExpect to get to Port Said tomorrow at noon, so busy packing – just heard a great argument about Miss ASQUITH moving to London & Lord HALDANE subscribing to German prisoners fund, while the nation asks for War Bonds.\n\nThe wife is worrying at the prospect of being alone in Cairo but she will be in luxury – at HELIOPOLIS HOUSE HOTEL, is her address.\n","325":"\n\nArrived Port Said & caught train for Cairo arriving Heliopolis Hotel midnight, \nDolly knocked out, but safe & all luggage safe too. Cabled England & Australia safe arrival also wired Regiment, Mrs. Davis a friend waited up to see Dolly & sent Hotel car all very kind.\n Much Regimental news – many killed & many decorated a certain amount of regret missing it all.\n","326":"\n\nReported Head Quarters & got KIT, Cuth Fetherstonhough has the D.S.O.!!! I met his wife. \nMay get a job as O.C. 1st L.H. Training Regiment at Moascar but nothing certain yet.\n Went Hospitals & saw all the wounded & got news. My Sergt. Major has been killed. I brought a watch from England for him, & many other good men. \nI feel going back after missing all the recent fighting, D.S.O.s & M.C.s have been won while I was away.\n","327":"\n\nArranged Dolly’s affairs & she remains for present at Heliopolis House, Heliopolis, may come to Ismalia later on. My Diary now will only be of interest to the family – if I am not in the front line. The Moral of all ranks has improved tremendously with the success of the advance on Jerusalem. I have not got any mail yet, but it will be with the Regt. address as before & I will get it stopped if remaining here.\n","328":"\n\nMoasca\n\nArrived Moascar & took over command 1st L.H. Training Regiment. May stop here a bit but await instructions from Division, very cold at night now but bright fresh sunny days. Col. McLeish Remount Depot is just behind me & I called on him, he sent regards to JOE. Please send MAY some of the snap shots of Dolly I sent last letter, I have no other photos here but will send as soon as I get one.\n","329":"\n\nReceived 62 letters, none missing dating from July to Nov. I sorted them out into proper sequence & read them like a book. Also got Pocket Book from Joe. Heaps of Papers came along also, many thanks for them. Jim Ayre is well but Bob RONALD badly wounded again & many others you will see in the Casualty Lists in Papers. \nI feel ashamed at having asked you to mention my return to old Sam.\n","330":"\n\nA draft went to Joppa today but no orders for me & I shall be content to do my 3 months in charge here. Dolly’s Hospital will be within sight & Ismalia where she will live is only 1 mile away. Note all your news, & hope you got letters from England. Will look out for PARCELS mentioned. Went Ismalia for lunch & interviewed British Red + & arranged Flat for Dolly also saw C.O. of Hospital & had a hot bath at the French Club.\n","331":"\n\nCol. McLeish is writing to General Lee to get job for JOE in L.H. as now I feel he will not be content unless he comes.\n\nPARCEL arrived containing SOKS, Bed Socks, Soap, Toffees, Shortbread – all very acceptable, the \nbest\n soap always is COAL TAR Wrights by preference. BANJO Patterson is in camp adjoining me - & many men & Officers I have known for years.\n","332":"\n\nDined at adjoining MESS & in afternoon rode into Ismalia , the men here will have a good Xmas Turkey, Fruit, & a bottle of Beer per man, sports on Boxing day. I spent one Xmas day returning from Gallipoli one Xmas day at El Arish & this one I hope in comfort here.\n\nReinforcements have just marched in a lot of Boys, chiefly, all pass through this Training Requirement, & do Musketry etc:- the Cadre are changed every 3 months so if I get it I won’t mind.\n","333":"\n\nLetter from MAY dated 5\/11\/17 & addressed Captain Weir. I’ve been a MAJOR for a year now – she asks Charlie TYSON’S rank it is Captain & M.C. Another lot of Parcels arrived tonight viz. Camphor ICE, Shortbread PLUM PUDDING Butterscotch & Cream in one & in the other from Home I found MITS, SOKS, Muffler, Butter Scotch, Cough drops, Sardines Toffee etc:- so I am well supplied & just for Xmas too thank you all so much for the work you do in packing & thinking & buying these things. Went Church.\n","334":"\n\nThe gods are good to me. I’ve got leave to spend Xmas Day with my little wife & am off back to Cairo tonight, returning on the 26th early. Have engaged rooms for Dolly in Ismalia , as feel pretty certain of things now. Attended Lecture on Machine Guns use in Palestine, but as a sand storm was blowing could not hear much. The troops PORK was sent here \ndead\n & has been lying half covered in sand on the Railway line since morning. Q.M.s fault of course.\n","335":"\n\nI spent the day with my little wife & had lunch at Continental Hotel. Could not get Permit for Dolly to go Ismalia & I got a wire on arrival in Cairo to rejoin my Regiment so goodbye to dreams of Moascar Base for a while, but I am quite happy about it as feel I’ve had a long holiday – so get on board the train tonight at 6 p.m. & have my dinner on a Troop train – Dolly stays at Heliopolis for a bit now.\n","336":"\n\nCamped night at Moascar & took charge of Draft of 300 men for the front. I am glad in a way to get into the firing line as I feel I’ve been away too long – Conscience easier.\n\nMany men make Xmas just an excuse for getting drunk. I may get the job at Moascar later on meantime Dolly will work at No. 14 A.G.H. Posting this love to all. I’ve not wished anyone a Merry Xmas, it seems a farce.\n","337":"\n\nBACK at Moascar owing to Railway line being washed away by rain have to wait another few days \n& could have been with my little wife all this time.\n Having dinner with Col. \nMcLeish\n tonight in his MESS. Did I mention seeing STANLEY BRAIM he has improved a lot & is now a Cadet in the Flying Corps & may get his commission, he is not drinking now. Letter from Laura & redirected one from May, please I did not get photo of Jack & \nDouglas & I am\n a Major not a Captain now for a year.\n","338":"\n\nNo use May sending me Photo here better keep it – I have no good one of Dolly at present, later I’ll send \none, meantime you might spare a snap shot of Dolly for her – I see May\n talks of the Family growing Custard APPLES!!! in Q’land. I have no faith in these things in competition with Chinamen.\n\nOn a Court Martial tomorrow still waiting for Railway clearance. Beautiful weather but cold at night.\n","339":"\n\nPresident of Court Martial usual thing Drunk & stoning the Military Police. Still no word of train. My KIT all packed up & standing by for Palestine. This Camp trains been in every branch of the service - & is a good refresher, but I am a Soldier now.\n\nMail arrived from Australia, MOTHER\/DAISY Nov. 11 & Nov. 18 & one from Mrs. Angus Robertson, good of her to write. Loud Cheers just got leave to go to Cairo again tonight & see the wife returning tomorrow.\n","340":"\n\nSpent the Day with Dolly & returned by 6 o’clock train a 3 hours run to Moascar expect to get away tomorrow.\n\nTook Dolly to Continental for Dinner, she has been to 3 or 4 dances since she came, & girls are very acceptable – so far English people here. Peace proposals are in the air & I really think the end is not so far off as some may think.\n","341":"\n\nInspected by Lt. General Chauvel our old Brigadier this morning. I go so soon as the Railway is available to take me, so will see Jerusalem very soon I hope now.\n\nCurrent topic of conversation is the failure of Conscription. This may let JOE get away but I do hope he won’t throw up his job. We all remember the anxiety before he got it & it is more secure than ever a Station Manager’s.\n\n"}}
