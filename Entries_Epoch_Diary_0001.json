We were kept busy with a \"banjo\" & sandbags trying to put up a bit of cover for our stay.\n\nThe officer (Pugh) who took over the Coy after Captain Pearce was evacuated came along the trench to tell us to be prepared to move when the relief came & he said \"Wake those men up & tell them to get ready\" But the poor fellows around were beyond the waking process as they were the killed of the afternoon.\n\n The attitudes of some were so natural as they sat in the floor of the trench backed up against the side with their rifles in their hands that in the moonlight they were easily mistaken for soldiers having an earthly sleep.
