Comforts from the Sydney A.M.C. Comforts Depot and from the War Chest Funds were distributed today. They consisted of a parcel for each man and rich additions to the regular menu, Plum Puddings included. In the evening “The Nightbirds\" gave us an amusing entertainment in the large recreation tents. It was such a great success that the Colonel wishes these men to extend the first half of the Program and give a night’s Entertainment to the troops of the 5th Division when they come back to this district shortly.\n","2":"\n\nStriking a hospital tent in the morning and erecting it again in another part of the grounds. At 1 p.m. 10 of us went to the famous Caves near Naours where refugees used to hide in times of Invasion. These Caves contain about 300 rooms, one cave being ½ mile long. A whole Division of troops 20,000 could be accomodated here, horses, artillery etc. The names of John Norton & Eva Pannett are to be seen autographed on a stone just inside the entrance. Met “Ginger\" Smith from Mosman.\n","3":"\n\nDentist’s at Vignacourt this morning and again in the afternoon to have the temporary filling removed because it was giving trouble.\n\nDrizzling rain all day.\n","4":"\n\nRaining all morning.\n\nAnother trip to the dentist, and in the afternoon was included in a party to fill limbers at the quarry with stones for mending roads.\n","5":"\n\nWater fatigue drawing water from the well and filling the carts. Last time we were on this job we had two oil drums and two kerosene tins on the rope, but all were missing when we were ready to start work. I was therefore asked to cut the tops off more drums and clean them out. Went into Vignacourt for tea and afterwards visited the local small Picture Show in company with three others from our unit.\n\nThe weather today was glorious.\n","6":"\n\nDentist’s at Vignacourt this morning. Raining. Afternoon off duty.\n","7":"\n\nBeautiful Day. No duty. Church Service in morning and walk to Vignacourt in afternoon.\n\nThe village of Vignacourt is about 2 miles from Olincourt Chateau.\n","8":"\n\nFinished with Dentist. Drizzling Rain. Afternoon carrying timber for new huts which are being erected in the grounds. Tea in Vignacourt, afterwards visited picture show. It was snowing heavily on our way home\n","9":"\n\nOn Piquet. Went into Vignacourt for tea and afterwards spent a very fine evening at a concert given by Tommies in the local Hall. It was a great success – a scream from commencement to finish. I doubt whether I have ever seen a better one. The new 5th Divisional Australian Band performed splendidly under Wellings.\n","10":"\n\nOn Piquet. In the evening we again went to the concert in Vignacourt\n","11":"\n\nA pleasant surprise came this morning when Connell & I were informed that we could go to Amiens on leave. This follows a special request we made to an officer a few days back. We travelled in by Motor Ambulance and arrived there when snow was falling pretty heavily. Had dinner at the Hotel Modern, looked through the wonderful Cathedral and walked all round the city. For a matter of curiosity we had a ride on the queer trams. Sent post card views of the city home. Amiens is a beautiful city and the trip proved rather a fine outting except that it was a bit short. Returned by Motor 4.30 p.m.\n","12":"\n\nQuiet day. Misty rain falling. Went into Vignacourt for tea.\n","13":"\n\nNothing doing in morning. Afternoon – Issued with any shortages in equipment required by the Bearers who leave for the front tomorrow, afterwards went into Vignacourt for tea. Another Concert by the Nightbirds took place in our recreation tent tonight & proved highly successful.\n","14":"\n\nParade at 9.30 a.m. in full marching order preparatory to moving off. Marched out from Olincourt Chateau as snow was falling heavily and on arriving at Flesselles Railway Station we entrained. The fields on all sides were covered with snow 6 metres deep. Disentrained near Buire Station and marched to Ribemont. Here we are now settled in an old building previously used for storing grain etc. Cobwebs and rats are numerous.\n","15":"\n\nWe spent a very cold night. Not moving off today. A party of us walked to a local Mobile Workshop & watched the “Tommies\" preparing to move a 15\" gun. In the afternoon we went out for another walk to keep warm & after tea visited an amusement hall in Mericourt which is financed by the Aust. Comforts Fund. The performance consisted of a picture show, concert & Drama combined. “Some\" Drama too.\n","16":"\n\nMoving away tomorrow. Bitterly cold all day. We had nothing to do but move about and keep warm.\n","17":"\n\nUp at 6 a.m., moved off at 9 a.m. Snow deep on the ground and has been falling all day. Marched through Buire, Dernancourt and Meaulte to the famous old Main Dressing Station at Becordel where we spent many a miserable day some weeks back. Sleeping here for the night.\n","18":"\n\nManaged to get a stretcher to sleep on last night. Snow was falling when we awoke this morning and it continued all day. We marched out from Becordel soon after 10 a.m. and reached Bernafay Wood at 1 p.m. On all sides snow is about 6 inches deep. This time we are to be quartered in Bow Huts which we built last month when here before.\n","19":"\n\nNot doing anything all day. The snow is still thick on the ground, and, in order to have a wash we have to boil snow. Our present quarters are now quite comfortable. Merry time in the hut prior to “lights out\".\n","20":"\n\nI wasn’t feeling too well today so did not go out with the others from “A\" Section who were taken out to carry on with the building of a new A.A.D.S. some 4 miles to the right of our present No. 3 (or Battery) Post. Freezing cold and frosty – Ground still white with snow.\n","21":"\n\nCold and snowing heavily. Water in our water bottles is frozen. Tea freezes in a short space of time. Canteen open – financed by officers.\n","22":"\n\nBitterly cold. Our boots get frozen and have to be warmed and softened over the fire before we can put them on. Went to a concert tonight in a big new Y.M.C.A. Hut near Montauban and it proved a very fine one indeed. Some really good artists are to be found in the Army.\n","23":"\n\nSo cold today that the wheels of the water cart were frozen to the ground and we had to loosen the hard ground with a pick. Today I have been on a job of digging an old German trench a bit wider so that it can be made into a dugout to accomodate bearers, at the A.D.S. The sky has been beautifully clear and Fritz aeroplanes ventured over. Later in the evening heavy shells came over, some killing and wounding 12th Fld. Amb. men a few hundred yards away from us. Tomorrow we go to the trenches for 7 days. I was hoping to be off to England on leave but unfortunately will have to wait another week.\n","24":"\n\nOff duty all the morning. At midday the R.A.P. parties, which included our squad, moved off to the line, having got our feet washed with the new “trench foot\" preparation on the way out. Our squad were some time in finding our post, after wandering dangerously near the firing line. I don’t think \nthink\n we will go for any more walks in that direction. Finally stationed in Windmill trench (practically the same as Needle Trench) quite close to where we were when last in action here, but this time we have a deep dug-out after the style of the Germans. Les Boeufs lies a little to our right. We were doomed to a rush of patients as soon as we took over.\n","25":"\n\nFairly busy all night. This dugout is very warm and comfortable. It is occupied by infantry A.M.C. details and also as a trench feet hospital. The Primus Stove comes in handy for warm meals. Heavy shelling took place today but we only had a few cases to take down.\n","26":"\n\nNot disturbed once during the night and all was quiet until we were relieved at 3 p.m. The weather is still extremely cold and snow covers the surrounding country. All the water is frozen into ice – condensed milk is frozen – in fact everything is. The tinned foodstuffs contain pieces of ice too. Returned to No. 4 post, the A.A.D.S. in Gun Alley on being relieved from the Regimental Aid post. Got into bed as soon as possible to keep warm.\n","27":"\n\nWe were next for duty all night but luckily enough were not required to get out of bed. At 5 o’clock this morning a terrific bombardment opened up, indicating that the Tommies had hopped over the bags to our right. It seems that they have captured 2 lines of trenches and numerous prisoners. As a birthday present to the Kaiser and also in reply to our success this morning the Germans fiercely bombarded all points very heavily. The crest at our No. 3 post has been badly cut up. Some of our guns have suffered. German planes brought to earth in a fine sight. The weather today has been a bit too clear for our liking. Rather a large number of wounded came through.\n","28":"\n\nAnother quiet night. Bitterly cold today and nothing warm to eat or drink. Only get out of bed whenever there is a case to be carried on.\n","29":"\n\nQuiet again during the night so far as wounded were concerned but the guns and shells continued unceasingly. We still remain in bed until required for duty. Rations are very poor indeed and far from cheerful – One loaf of frozen bread between 7, a small tin of jam and a tin of pork and beans. No water obtainable anywhere – all is frozen into ice. Snow still covers the ground. Two German aeroplanes brought to earth.\n","30":"\n\nFreezing cold. This being a clear day artillery on both sides are busy. Shells from Fritz have been raining in all directions. No improvement in the rations yet.\n","31":"\n\nIcy again today and a heavy day for stretcher-bearers. The wounded came through in a continuous stream. When relieved at about 4 p.m. we had to carry a patient out in addition to our equipment and my word it was a lively trip. High Explosive shrapnel burst above us all the way. On returning to Bernafay Wood I was disappointed to learn that all leave has been stopped indefinitely. Should have gone today.\n","32":"\n\nNot doing anything in particular today. One section is required to assist back at Bellevue Farm Rest Camp, just a few hundred yards this side of Albert. Our unit is taking the place over. “A\" section are therefore to go back to this Rest Camp in the morning.\n","33":"\n\nSet off at 8 a.m. – packs being carried on a limber. Arrived Bellevue Farm about midday. Some of the 6th and 2nd Field Ambulances are here. Our unit has not yet arrived from Vignacourt. Met Bill Bailey.\n\nHeavy shells were thrown into Albert about 6 p.m.\n","34":"\n\nManaged to get a fairly soft job, that of loading motor ambulances every afternoon with patients for the Casualty Clearing Station. It only takes about ½ an hour daily.\n\nThe spare time I had today was occupied in strolling round Albert. Shells come over pretty frequently.\n","35":"\n\nInto Albert again this morning. Last night a Fritz aeroplane came across and dropped bombs round our camp. He \nspe\n swept hospital tents with machine gun fire, but fortunately there were no patients in the tents. One chap was firing at the airman with a rifle and got into trouble for doing so.\n","36":"\n\nWe are now very comfortable in this camp. A good coal fire burns in the tent all day long. Still doing practically nothing, and again visited Albert.\n","37":"\n\nNothing doing.\n\nSame as yesterday.\n","38":"\n\nUnexpectedly informed that I could go on leave tonight, and was given about 15 minutes to get ready. Had to report at Albert Station at 6 p.m. to catch a train leaving at 9.30 p.m. We were fortunate in getting a hospital train. Tea is made on the “Kitchen Car\" and served out whilst the train is in motion.\n","39":"\n\nUnexpectedly inf\n\nArrived at Le Havre 4 p.m. after passing the Portuguese Army on their way up to the front. Marched straight to the boat. Stayed on deck for an hour or so in the lifebelt box, then we managed to secure a cabin down below. I put on a sergeants coat and went in with them for some supper. Left Le Havre at midnight.\n","40":"\n\nArrived Southampton at sunrise. Luckily got off the boat early enough to catch the first train arriving at Waterloo Station London at 11 a.m. Tea & cake and French money changed on the platform, Com. Bank & A.I.F. Headquarters. Dinner at War Chest Fund rooms opposite A.I.F. Headquarters. Put up at Imperial Hotel Russel Square. Out for tea elsewhere and afterwards went to the Hippodrome Theatre to see Zig-Zag – Very Fine Indeed. It’s a treat in bed tonight with our heads sunk into the pillows, quite a change from that wretched France.\n","41":"\n\nSwitched on the lights & discovered that it was 10 a.m. Ordered breakfast in bed. At 11 a.m. set off and first visited The Houses of Westminster including the House of Lords & House of Commons. Then we went into Westminster Abbey, St. Pauls and The Tower of London. We saw the burial place of The Duke of Wellington, his £20,000 gun carriage of 18 tons. The tomb of Nelson & the bit of needlework by his sister. Wolseleys grave and that of Lord Roberts. Kitcheners sword & the letter he wrote asking for 300,000 men. Roberts’ revolver. The Gun Carriage used at King Edward’s funeral. Crown Jewels. Place of execution of Anne Bolyn. Ancient Armour etc. etc.\n\nPictures at night.\n\nToday we also saw Wellington’s uniform.\n","42":"\n\nAfter breakfast started out for a few bus rides, walked round Buckingham Palace – Whitehall, Hyde Park and other notable places. In front of Buckingham Palace is the famous statue of Queen Victoria.\n\nTrafalgar Square decorated with notices in connection with The Victory Loan.\n","43":"\n\nIn morning went to Whiteleys and had a few Bus rides round Paddington. Ride in tube from Charing Cross to Kings Cross. In afternoon went to a performance at The Colliseum. This is a magnificent Theatre of marble and about 24 \ndozen\n boxes. At 9.45 p.m. caught train to Berwick from Kings Cross.\n\nPassed York & Newcastle arrived Berwick just over the border at 8.30 a.m. (over).\n","44":"\n\n8.30 a.m. Now in Berwickshire near the sea coast after crossing the Border Bridge. Jean waiting at the station with a motor car. Travelled 9 miles to Ayton. Looked round the grounds and the village of Ayton during the day.\n\nThis is rather a pretty spot – snow caps the surrounding heights.\n","45":"\n\nWalked to Ayton Station. Train to Berwick and then on to Edinburgh arriving there about 10 a.m. Walked under Arthurs Seat – through Holyrood Palace and Edinburgh Castle. Went into St. Giles Cathedral – passed John Knox’s house. Dinner at Jenners. Afternoon trip to Firth of Forth in Motor Bus. Its a pity the day has been foggy especially on account of the views from Edin. Castle and the Forth Bridge. Saw portion of the fleet lying at anchor. Returned to Berwick by train just after 5 p.m. and motored out to Ayton. \n\nAlso saw Scotts Memorial.\n","46":"\n\nWalked to Ayton Station in time to catch train for Berwick. Left Berwick 8.24 a.m. and travelled to York then across country past Sheffield & Derby to Birmingham arriving there at 7 p.m. Met by Uncle Harry & Bessie. Tram to their house at 238 Willow Av. Edgbaston.\n\nThe country round Sheffield is full of ammunition works. Saw where 2 Zep. bombs had dropped. Leaning tower near Sheffield.\n\nEdgbaston\n\n(Aunt Emma Morris\n\n(Uncle Harry\n\n(Bessie Jones\n\n(Eric “\n\n(Leonard “\n","47":"\n\nIn morning went for walk with Bessie round the neighbouring country & the town of Bearwood.

Called on Mr. Tom Lloyds and at Harrington’s Bakery. Saw all the old houses where father was born and lived etc. The cemetery, but didn’t go inside. \nDinner\n Tea at Uncle Charlie Allsop’s brought here by Madge. Called at Auntie Lunt’s in afternoon. Bessie took me back to Harringtons.\n","49":"\n\nWent to the Wesleyan Chapel with Harringtons & Edgbaston people afterwards had dinner at Uncle Charlie Allsop’s, called at Auntie Lizzie’s and had tea at Auntie Lunts. Returned to Uncle Charlie’s for a few hours then back to Ridding House with Bessie & Madge. At Auntie Lunts place there must have been 15 people this evening. A crowd also gathered at Uncle Charlie’s.\n","50":"\n\nLeft Ridding House at 9.30. Caught 10 o’clock train to Walsall. Changed Walsall thence to Birmingham. Auntie Emma & Eric came in to Birmingham. Auntie Eliza & Uncle George came to Pelsall station also Kathleen. Delayed by fog & missed the train to London from B’ham. Walked round to the North Western Station (Snow Hill) and then the train here was ½ hour late. Arrived London 3.15 p.m., raced to A.I.F. for blankets & tin hat. Off to Southampton on 2nd train. Need not have hurried and probably would have been given a few more days in London. No boats at Southampton so we were put into a Rest Camp after straggling some 4 miles out of the city.\n","51":"\n\nToo tired to get up in time for breakfast. I went into Southampton for a few hours this morning. Passed the remainder of the day in writing at the Salvation Army Hut opposite on in the Y.M.C.A. Hut.\n\nIn the evening, though no leave was granted we all found a way of getting into Southampton.\n\nNo boats to France yet.\n","52":"\n\nStill at the Rest Camp and no signs of moving. Spent the day as I did yesterday and went into Southampton again in the evening.\n","53":"\n\nIn the morning we were passing the time away in the Salvation Army and Y.M.C.A. Huts. At 3 o’clock everyone in the camp had to fall in and we were marched down to the boat. Great crowds watched us march along the streets singing. The singing soon stopped when we arrived at the wharf. We five remained on deck. Moved out from the wharf at 8 p.m.\n\nThe huge hospital ship Aquitania was in port when we left.\n","54":"\n\nI had a little sleep on deck during the night. The trip was very smooth. We reached Le Havre at 3 a.m. disembarked at 8 a.m. and marched to a rest camp some distance from the wharf. Issued with tickets to provide meals, and allotted huts to sleep in. Sea planes were flying over the harbour as we came in and two airships were busy in the air all day. The huge sheds for housing these machines are next to our camp.\n","55":"\n\nReveille at 3 a.m. Straggled in a mob to the railway and scrambled on to the first train to be seen. This was very amusing. Luckily the train happened to be the right one.\n\nIn the train all day making back for Albert.\n","56":"\n\nArrived Albert 4 a.m. walked to the Bellevue Farm Rest Camp and found our unit still there. Rumours current relative to the Germans having fallen back before Bapaume.\n\nWhile I was away arrangements were made between the Field Cashier & our unit to put me into the 56th Batt. as Pay Sergeant, so I have to go out there tomorrow.\n","57":"\n\nLeft at midday per motor ambulance for Bernafay Wood, ascertained from Divisional Hd. Quarters the whereabouts of the 56th. Went there & found that the position has been filled by a man from the Batt. Good Luck for me because I don’t like the idea of going to this unit.\n\nInterviewed the Field Cashier & then returned to our own unit.\n","58":"\n\nWriting letters to make up for lost time.\n\nMeals here are better now than before we left for leave.\n\nAeroplanes busy today in connection with the mysterious German retirement.\n\nWent into Albert in the evening.\n","59":"\n\nToday we witnessed a very fine sight. Large bodies of cavalry passed on their way to the line. The 1st Dragoon Guards, Mounted Machine Gun Corps, and Indian Cavalry were among the number, Lancers too were in the line.\n","60":"\n\nLeft for trip to Heilly at 12 o’clock to take dirty clothes from our baths to be washed. Heilly is 11 Kilometres from Albert. Passed the Detention Camp where defaulters are imprisoned. Saw the posts to which men are chained daily for No. 1 Field Punishment. This is true, and a disgrace to any Nation professing to fight for liberty.\n","61":"\n\nAt midday took party of eye patients to Becordel. Lt. Col. Williams who used to be a Major in our unit came down from the front line shot through the lungs. He is in a serious condition.\n\nWent to Pierrot Show in Albert after tea. This place is financed by the Aust. Comforts Fund.\n","62":"\n\nFrosty and bitterly cold this morning. Left for Heilly at 9 a.m. with General Service Waggon & clothes to be exchanged. From Heilly I went into Corbie and returned to Bellevue Farm by motor lorry which was drawing a 6 inch howitzer along. Corbie is about 18 Kilos from Albert.\n\nAfter tea went to picture show in Albert.\n","63":"\n\nVery cold again today. Caught for a job – cleaning out a gutter. News to hand that Lt. Col. Williams died last night at 9 p.m. Party to go from this unit tomorrow to be present at his funeral. \n\nThis afternoon I was burning off rubbish.\n\nChurch service in the grounds of the camp at 3 p.m. The 5th Div. Band attended.\n","64":"\n\nMarched off to Edgehill – between Dernancourt and Buire – and witnessed the burial of Lt. Col. Williams. A party of about 26 from our unit attended. Bob Troup the batman who left Aust. with Lt. Col. Williams fainted at the graveside & Capt. Irvine & Major Donald were deeply affected.\n\nPierrot Show in Albert after tea.\n","65":"\n\nTaking down 10 large tents all day. Worked up till 9 p.m.\n\nWe have now moved to another part of the grounds but are even more comfortable than before. There are ten of us in a large tent. A good coal fire burns all day long. Toast and various other additions which are made possible with a good fire, are making us quite fat. The tent presents a very homelike appearance with deck chairs, forms, and stretchers surrounding the fire. The smoke from the coal makes us as black as niggers.\n","66":"\n\nUp very early to continue with the work of getting the tents away. This kept me busy all day.\n\nBitterly cold.\n","67":"\n\nTook another load of clothes to the baths at Heilly. A bitterly cold blizzard was blowing all day and we felt pretty uncomfortable sitting up on the front seat of a general service waggon. Snow falling heavily.\n","68":"\n\nGeneral Duties.\n","69":"\n\nTrip to Heilly.\n","70":"\n\nA beautiful day. Had nothing to do but stroll round Albert. Shells seem to have ceased coming over this way.\n","71":"\n\nWent to Heilly with clothes for the laundry. Concert in Albert after tea.\n","72":"\n\nDoing odd jobs all day. Germans have again retreated – this time to a distance of a mile.\n","73":"\n\nLight rain all day.\n\nKit inspection at 9 a.m. afterwards went to Heilly again with clothes to be exchanged at the Baths.\n\nWent to “Anzac Coves\" Concert in Albert at night.\n","74":"\n\nDoing nothing all day except for a Gas Helmet Inspection at 2 p.m. Rumours that 40 bearers have to be kept in readiness for the line. Doubtless something big is expected. It is commonly know that Bapaume is to be attempted within a day or so.\n","75":"\n\nTrip to Heilly with clothes – met Carter from Brighton who has just joined our unit. 20 men to leave at 7 a.m. tomorrow. My name is not on the list. Heavy bombardment opened up in the evening\n","76":"\n\nThe bombardment continued all night. Bapaume fell at 4 a.m. The 30th Batt. were the first Australian troops to enter the town. The 8th Brigade & the 29th Tommy Division took it. Le Transloy has also fallen. Concert in our camp tonight.\n\nList of 30 names read out including mine. These have to leave for the line at 6 a.m. tomorrow.\n\nBapaume is in flames so also are the surrounding villages.\n","77":"\n\nUp at 6 a.m. Left Bellevue Farm at 7 a.m. marched to Meaulte Railway Siding and entrained here. On arriving at Bernafay Wood we were put into a hut where we remained all day.\n\nThe quietness here now is very remarkable. No guns are to be seen anywhere. We do not go out to the line until tomorrow. Observation Balloon taken up to Delville Wood, along the road. Men walked along the road holding the ropes while the balloon floated along in the air.\n","78":"\n\nThe greatest day in our Military life to date. I was one of 4 volunteers to proceed into Bapaume at 7 a.m. Travelled there by Motor Amb. through Longueval, Contalmaison, Pozieres & Le Sars. Round Pozieres 8 “Tanks\" are lying damaged. Le Sars is one long street of Ruins. Before leaving Bapaume Fritz lit fires in nearly every third house. The destruction there is astounding. Our guns played havoc. Fires are still burning – 2 mines were exploded by Fritz in the main street. Heaps of debris block up every street. There isn’t one sound building in the town. In the centre of the town there was once a statue in memory of French fallen heroes in 1870. Well Fritz has removed the bronze figure & has put up an iron piping instead making it resemble an antiaircraft gun. German shells are dropping in the town. We are forming a dressing station in ruined premises.\n","79":"\n\nSlept in a double bed in the cellar of a ruined residence at No. 7 Rue de Republique. There is a terrace of fine places here, all smashed about. We are now busy clearing out the debris of Nos. 3, 5 & 7, the bottom floors of which are to be used as a dressing station. The second floor and the attic, \nare\n being in a sad condition, are quite unsafe. Our flags are now flying in the front garden. Shells are still coming over. The stories of how the 30th Battalion troops of the 8th Aust. Brigade entered Bapaume & raced after souvenirs are very amusing. They marched out wearing women’s hats, mens top hats, straw hats & German head gear. The guns are coming up in pursuit of Fritz and its a fine sight to see caterpillar tractors drawing the heavy guns along the Albert-Bapaume Road. Infantry are moving slowly with mounted troops out in front as scouts. Some of these are coming in wounded.\n","80":"\n\nSlept in the double bed again last night. Today has been spent in getting straight and cleaning out the buildings. Tonight all stretcher-bearers were cleared out of Bapaume and I went with a party along the Rue de Peronne to the village of Beaulencourt. When working out from Bernafay Wood through Delville Wood this village was opposite us in Fritz’s lines. Now it is nothing but a heap of ruins. All fruit trees have been cut down. We sleep in a German Dugout tonight running under a heap of bricks which once was a house. Trees along the Bapaume-Peronne Road have been cut down. Mine craters are also along this road.\n","81":"\n\nAt 9 a.m. we were divided up into various parties resulting in two of us being sent to a relay post back along the road to Bapaume, so that I am now half way between Bapaume and Beaulencourt in a little ruined house. A Red Cross flag is on the front door and between the 6 of us we take turns in carrying patients through to Bapaume Dressing Station as they are brought to us from Beaulencourt. From our front door we can see Delville Wood and all the important heights upon which Fritz’s shells used to fall round us at one time. Prince Frederick, third son of the Kaiser came through today so also did his aeroplane which we brought down. Drew rations for all our bearers in the line, from the A.S.C. now in Bapaume.\n","82":"\n\nSlept down in the cellar last night. This morning after breakfast I took a stroll round the villages, or one time villages of Reincourt and Bancourt out in Fritz’s direction. Both these places have been levelled to the ground & fruit trees have been cut down. The extensive scheme of barbed-wiring in these districts serves to indicate that Fitz’s original intention was to put up a stern fight rather than to retreat as he is now doing. The weather lately has been sunny and clear but the bitterly cold March winds are blowing in a gale.\n","83":"\n\nBitterly Cold Again.\n\nAeroplane dropped a note in Bapaume asking how the Prince is. (The one who was captured by us.) He has since died. Have just finished building a new fire place and chimney in this “shanty\" of ours. Rats are pretty numerous.\n","84":"\n\nA glorious day.\n\nGerman observation balloons can be seen in the distance. Big explosion occurred in the Town Hall cellars Bapaume today. Fritz apparently left mines which are exploded on the 8 day clock system. About 40 men are imprisoned underneath and their voices can be heard from the surface of the ground. Men are working for their very lives in trying to rescue the others below.\n","85":"\n\nStill fine.\n\nGreat contest in the air resulting in a severe loss to our air service. 9 German planes & 6 of ours had a battle in which 5 of ours came to earth & only one Fritz. Two of the planes came down in flames. More explosions have occurred in Bapaume. 3 of us are now sleeping on the ground floor instead of the cellar using stretchers to keep us off the cold tiles.\n\nOne of our posts along this Bapaume-Peronne Road has been cut out & the men are now in at the Main Dressing Station, Bapaume, erecting tents etc. 15th F. Amb. have moved up from Bernafay. Probably our post will soon be cut out as there is no work to do here.\n","86":"\n\nSnowing & cold outside.\n\nMore explosions in Bapaume. Other cellars have gone up into the air, one being a Staff billet. Here a number of German Prisoners had just been examined and had been taken about 20 yards from the cellar on their way elsewhere when the explosion made them turn round. They burst out laughing when they heard the facts. Orders reached us tonight saying that we have to evacuate this post and report to Capt. Marshall at the Collecting Station Beaulencourt tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock. So we have to break up the happy home.\n","87":"\n\nMy eyes are sore after sitting round the smoky fire last night. Left the “shanty\" at 9.15 a.m. and reached Beaulencourt at 10 o’clock. Le Transloy lies only a stone’s throw further up the road. Big log fire going all day in the old ruined house we have patched up. No orders have yet been issued relative to moving further on. Sleeping on old wire mattrass tonight. Observation balloon was taken past here today. It used to be in Delville Wood & now it has been transferred to a position nearer the front.\n\nThursday 29 March\n\nRain came through the roof on to our bed all night. Got up at 11 a.m. Orders that all men must shave today. 58th Batt. hopped the bags the other night & captured 2 machine guns, 2 searchlights etc., a very successful raid. The 2 machine gun crews who were captured were taken to Bapaume for examination. On passing the Town Hall these Fritzs laughed at the sight of dead bodies being carried out from the ruins. Australians on the roads rushed them with picks & could only be kept off by a strong guard. The Aust. demanded a chance to get at the Germans in order to nail them to the crucifixs & riddle them with bullets.\n\nLeft in party of 6 & moved off to Bancourt after tea, arriving there wet through. We are here to take casualties from the 55th Batt.\n\nFriday 30 March\n\nAwoke this morning & was surprised to hear the birds chattering. It is the first time for 18 months. The country round about here is quite green, so different to the other side of Bapaume. Went to Beaulencourt for rations – not ready in the morning so we had to return again in the afternoon. Only one stretcher-case came through last night and two of our chaps took him on. On coming to the big mine crater the whole lot, stretcher case included, slipped in.\n\nIt is rumoured today that the 8th Fld. Amb. go out of action on the 5th ulto.\n\nEvery village here is strewn with bottles which give the impression that Fritz is a bit of a drinker.\n\nSaturday 31 March\n\nUp at 10 a.m. Cold wind blowing all day.\n\nBy getting up late we save a meal and therefore make the most of the very short rations. There isn’t really enough for two meals a day.\n\nWent up to Beaulencourt for rations this afternoon.\n\nAll 8th Field Ambulance bearers are now coming to Beaulencourt, leaving the 15th Fld. Amb. to work out from Bapaume.\n\nThe","88":" Field Amb. are going out of action in two days time.\n\nAgenda Souvenir Journalier 1917\n\nDeuxieme Trimestre\n","89":"\n\nApril Fools Day. A Balloon went up from Villers Au Flos & Fritz immediately flew across and brought it down in flames. The Airmen came to earth in parachutes. This is the balloon we saw on the 28th ult.\n\nConnell & I were today ordered to go to the front line with the 55th Batt. for the purpose of ascertaining whether provision has been made out there for bringing wounded away. There is to be an action tomorrow morning. We walked all day carrying blankets & passing through these villages:- Haplincourt,\n\nBreakfast was the only meal we had today.\n\nReturned to Bancourt in the evening and are now quartered in the old church ruins. All the above named villages are wrecked in a frightful manner.\n","90":"\n\nOut of bed at 10.30 a.m. Bitterly cold wind blowing all morning which later on turned into a snowstorm.\n\nWalked into Bapaume for canteen goods without success. This afternoon two of us went up to Beaulencourt for the rations. Today there is a vast improvement in rations. Not only has Capt. Marshall given Connell & I a tin of Glaxo & Arrowroot on account of yesterdays exertion but Col. Shepherd, O.C. of our ambulance has sent his bearers extra bread, butter etc. (a motor amb. full). The attack came off this morning resulting in a success. We have taken all the villages we were asked to. Wounded are now pouring into Bapaume.\n","91":"\n\nRaining & windy. In the evening two of our observation Balloons which had been put up for the first time in Grevillers suffered badly. Fritz flew across in precisely the same manner as on the","92":" inst. and dropped fire bombs on both, bringing them down in flames. It was a wonderful & brilliant feat. However we knocked the plane out nearer the front line so the loss has been evened up a bit. The other Fritz who was responsible for Sunday’s feat was also brought to earth. 500 wounded from our 54 & 55th Batts. in the recent fight, but Fritz’s losses were heavier. The 8th F. Amb. went out to assist the 15th with the stretcher-bearing. 6 German counter-attacks have been repulsed. Heavy gun firing is going on in the direction of Arras.\n","93":"\n\nAt various stages today the weather has been wet, snowy, & fine alternately. Last night the Australians took another village. All through the night and throughout today the heavy guns have been booming up the line a bit. According to Div. Hd. Quarters America has declared war on Germany. When we went to Beaulencourt today for rations we were informed that the 8th Fld. Amb. are to be relieved tomorrow morning and tomorrow night will be spent at Bernafay Wood. Pioneers are in this village (Bancourt) now getting timber from the ruins to make dug-outs in the front line. They are also pushing on with the light railway. All day Fritz has been dropping “heavies\" into Bapaume. About 100 German prisoners were taken last Monday.\n\nThursday 5 April\n\nBeautiful day. Pushed the “spider\" back to Beaulencourt, with all stretchers and blankets we have been using in Bancourt. Early in the afternoon we commenced a long tramp back to Bernafay Wood arriving there between 5 and 6 p.m. The whole of this country is now desolate, and not a sign of life of any kind was to be seen as we came through, passing our old firing line (Sunray Trench) and the old posts we occupied for weeks. This is the track which runs through Delville Wood. In the old “No Mans Land\" shell damage is something frightful. The remainder of our Amb. are staying at Bernafay tonight and will be coming on to Bellevue tomorrow. I continued on to Bellevue tonight by train. Bombs dropped round camp. Balloon replaced at Villers Au Flos today.\n","94":"\n\nSlept in a ward last night. The remainder of the bearers came down by road carrying everything, and arrived here soon after midday. I have been busy throughout the day in patching up two little brick huts which a few of us intend occupying. After tea Connell & I strolled into Albert. This town is gradually being inhabited by civilians again. Fritz flies over every clear night and drops bombs. He got 13 staff officers recently. Met Bill Bailey again in Albert. The men who remained in camp while we were in the line have arranged a dinner to welcome the bearers back. This is to take place tomorrow night. The French people at the farm have been busy killing & dressing a pig for the occasion.\n","95":"\n\nMild Day. Making & fitting a stove for a coal fire in our huts. An oil drum serves the purpose well, with piping to take the smoke out. 13 of us occupy these huts and are getting quite comfortable. Stretchers to sleep on. The dinner passed off very well and so did the concert given by the “Nightbirds\" later in the evening. “The Nightbirds\" is the name given to the 8th F. Amb. concert party. Officers provided the pig for the dinner tonight. In response to words of thanks expressed by one of our sergeants at the concert, Col.

Moved off at 12 a.m. by motor lorries to the big Main Dressing Station at Vaulx, travelling up the straight road from Albert to Bapaume then out to the left of our previous posts. Nearly all the Aust. Ambulances are here and they have suffered terribly. Over 300 casualties in the stretcher-bearers. Fritz has been deliberately shooting them. Met Harry Reynolds, Coffey, Bill Bailey & Totton. All reports say its like \nHell\n out near the Hindenburg line. Dressing Station shelled this morning – men raced away down the hillside. D.D.M.S. congratulating the stretcher bearers on their recent work through Barrages. 1 Driver & 2 horses of 14th Fld. Amb. killed this afternoon, 2 other bearers brought in wounded. Party of B. Section left for A.D.S.\n\nThursday 10 May\n\nRather warm weather.\n\nLast night while we were in bed Fritz again threw about 15 shells round our Dressing Station. It was funny to see some chaps spring out of bed and run. Gas alarms through the night at intervals also kept us awake. Moving cook house this morning. Shelling has been Heavy today, numbers of shells dropping in our camps. Over 20 casualties – 2 Motors (Amb.) smashed up. Each time shelling commenced we galloped away as fast as our legs would carry us. At 7.30 p.m. our stretcher-bearers left for the line. Shelled heavily all the way. Finally took up position in a sunken road just a few hundred yards from Fritz’s lines. Its like \nHell\n out here carrying from the Hindenburg Line across the open chased along by “whiz-bangs\". Bullecourt stands to our left & Quent to our right.\n","127":"\n\nGlorious day but a little too warm. In the early hours, just after midnight the fearful hammering of guns and shells was terrible. Fritz attempted an attack this afternoon after a heavy artillery preparation, under which we shivered from head to foot, but he got such a frightful hammering in return. The chaos on the battlefield was \nperfect Hell\n. We carried through barrages of heavy fire and fumes. Dead bodies are in an awful mess and are smashed up by shells. Then the sun makes things pretty ripe. Shelled heavily again as we were being relieved, the sunken road dressing station being in danger. Returned to Main Dressing Station late tonight. This has been the worst day of my life.\n\nCasualties in our Amb. today number 8 including Lyn Palmer & MacDonald.\n","128":"\n\nArrived at M.D.S. 2.30 a.m. The Dressing Station has been shifted back from Vaulx to within 1½ miles of Bapaume, as a result of the shelling. Slept out in the open till 9.30 a.m. The sun is again \nvery\n warm. This afternoon Samuels came & asked me if I could ride a Motor Bike. A little headwork told me it might mean a good job so I said “Yes\". A few spins up & down the road were highly successful without any spills.\n","129":"\n\nWarm again today. All stretcher-bearers left for the line this morning. Every available man was sent, but I have been left behind as a Despatch Rider on the Douglas Bike. Up to the present I have not missed one carry in the line & have been out every time. Having done as much as anyone in the unit and considering that very few of the original 8th are here now I think its my turn for a sweet job. Whether it will be permanent or not its hard to say, but each Amb. is supposed to have 2 Despatch Riders. All runs today were successful. Shelling of the roads was heavy. Fritz observation Balloon brought down.\n\nHeavy thunderstorm broke out just before midnight.\n","130":"\n\nShowery but otherwise very warm. Successful day on the motor bike. Fritz threw a few shells on the road near our camp. The chief event of the day was a brilliant piece of work in the air to Fritz’s credit. A plane flew over us at about 7000 ft. high – Our guns fired at him but didn’t seem to hit him. However he pretended to be knocked and fell over & over sideways until he came very low. Meantime we were all yelling with delight. Suddenly the plane righted itself and made off home followed by our battleplane.\n\nThe opinion has been advanced that this plane intended to dive at one of our balloons by means of the joke.\n","131":"\n\nCloudy & warm.\n\nHeavy gunfire continues at highest pitch.\n\nThe plane which ventured over yesterday on that tricky expedition was brought to earth out near the front line by one of our battleplanes.\n\nDespatch Riding.\n","132":"\n\nShowery all day.\n\nTommy Ambulance arrived to assist on this part of the front.

After the usual procedure of haircut bath etc. we had a good look round the city by 8 p.m. when we caught the return train to Albert.
