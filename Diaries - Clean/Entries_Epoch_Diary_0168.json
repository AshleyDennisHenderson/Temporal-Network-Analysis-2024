In Newcastle. Saw announcement of recruits wanted. So caught afternoon train home to be in time. Family rather astonished at my appearance.\n","2":" Off to barracks & after examination etc. was duly accepted in the A.M.C. Dismissed till Thursday.\n","3":" Went through my papers, destroying most & putting things in order generally.\n","4":" Spent in shopping fixing up insurance etc. preparing for departure.\n","5":" Appeared at Barracks with kit but was sent home at midday till the following day. Took the opportunity to write various letters of farewell. \n","6":" Appeared once more at barracks loaded our kit on wagons & marched off to camp. Our first jab was to pitch tents a work which no one had done before. After pegging all out we discovered our front flaps would not meet so our pegs had to be removed & hammered in again. The ultimate result was first class. Our Corps on the whole are first rate chaps. My tent in particular is a well contented one. Our leading light is a Parson & Cambridge man, a blue & international footballer etc.\n\nHaving brought some lunch we hungered not. In the afternoon we were marched to the depot & received our kit, a splendid one. Out tea consisted of meat, bread & jam to which we did full justice. At\n\nnight the hard earth was kind to us and we all slept well.\n","7":" Up at 6. Shower etc. dull till 8 then breakfast, meat & dry bread. Then marched to barracks for more kit.

One reared up & turned completely over. Rain continued all day. Played cards at night. \n","10":" Breakfast late owing to rain. Did nothing in morning. Lecture & demonstration at Barracks in afternoon. Our tent poet has burst out as below.\n\nI. Since we joined the army\n\nwe’ve all made different chums\n\nsome of them are barmy\n\nsome of them are bums\n\nsome of them are stiff\n\nsome of them are cold\n\nBut all of them are good enough\n\nLike me, to be enrolled.\n\nII. Ours is No 1. tent & full of decent lads. \n\n Each one just a soldier with individual fads\n\nHerbert is the captain & sings a decent song\n\nHe’s made himself quite popular\n\nThough we haven’t known him long.\n\nHe’s pretty good at tennis, in church he has some rank\n\nand serves the mess as treasurer, as experienced in the bank.\n\nIII. Greenwell is his neighbour, his place he proudly fills\n\nHe’s got a troubled stomach, so we designate him pills.\n\nHe turns in pretty early & isn’t long awake. \n\nHe’ll pass his time most pleasantly if sitting near a cake.\n\nIV. Then we have Young Jonesy, a lad who’s here to learn.\n\nHe wants to get a cross or two then safely return.\n\nThere’s not much doubt about him, he’s willing and\n\n he’s bright.\n\nWe’ll one & all stand by him & help him in \n\nhis fight.\n\nV. Brother Andrews – Padre bears a double Cross\n\nThe red one on his arm & the other – Life’s great loss.\n\nToday he’s just a soldier with a dollar clear a day\n\nBut his precept & example preaches more than he could say\n\nVI. Gissing is our tallest mate a chemist & a sport\n\nPossessor of a camera (which hasn’t yet been caught)\n\nThere’s no nonsense about him though above us all he towers\n\nHe tells us that in sleep he likes to spend his full eight hours.\n\nVII. Bingham is our baby & causes lots of mirth\n\nIf he hasn’t any funny jokes he’ll promptly \n\ngive one birth.\n\nHe’s likes to meet the ladies, he’s out on pleasure bent\n\nAnd when he puts his bed down he takes up half the tent\n\nHe’s next to me as bedmate & in his sleep he’ll talk\n\nOn everybody’s elses’s feet & clothes he seems to walk\n\nAnd now I’ve told you something of each the seven \n\nchums\n\nAnd if you do not know me say I am one of the bums.\n","11":" On parade 6.15 A.M. at stretcher drill.

My four were rather a trouble & the exertion expended during the morning was sufficient for a week most of us were saturated with perspiration We arrived back at Camp 11.45 AM having had no breakfast. However on the way home about 12 of us trooped into an hotel & counter lunch had just been brought on. We scoffed the lot much to owners annoyance. Happened to meet Guy Parker on wharf now a Lieutenant. 4 of our men sailed on this boat. My turn comes next. In the afternoon whilst playing cricket was hit on the leg with cricket ball. Caused awful pain & could not walk after it.\n","43":" Leg still bad, was visited during afternoon by Syd Morris, Mrs Carver and Jim Murphy so was comforted some\n","44":"","45":" &","46":" Leg very bad could not walk had to be carried to Latrines etc. Was kept busy however completing nominal rolls pay books and attestation papers preparatory to sailing. Had mother to visit me as I could not go home.\n\nThursday night father mother Syd & Ian came to say good-bye as I was to sail next day Mum bore up bravely & said goodbye like a Spartan.\n","47":" morning came at last & I hired a taxi to take me to the boat taking a fellow with me. After calling at the bank for our pay and buying some films I arrived at the boat to find Dad & Syd there to say a last goodbye, The troops were just arriving from Liverpool & looked an imposing sight. At first I feared that I might be turned back owing to my leg but I was allowed to go on but received a lot of chaff from my fellows about being wounded already. The Slany Bee left the wharf first to the accompaniment of great cheers singing etc. the public being allowed on the wharf just as she moved off. We followed shortly after with the band playing various national airs, Tipperary Auld Lang Syne etc. Instead of following the Bee out we anchored for an hour & then left the harbour for Brisbane much to our astonishment as we thought we were going\n\nvia Melbourne. Within an hour of sailing I was sick, 3 times in all during the afternoon but was well by the following day. The boat was very light and rolled considerably, the propellers coming out & racing occasionally. We are quartered in the Hospital & are extremely comfortable, good beds, bathrooms & Latrines to ourselves.\n","48":" It was the 18th. Feb last year I sailed for England & now the","49":" months after I sail again this time round the North of Australia but with what a different object in view We spent the day doing light duties such as laying out beds & recovering from seasickness & also had our first operation, As was rather painful, CHCL3 was administered with full success the patient swearing & carrying on through it all four of us holding him down. \n\nSaturday we arrived at Brisbane but were not allowed to land. I wrote several letters & gave them to various people to post, one to a girl, threw some to a man & some to a soldier going ashore. We took aboard our two transports some 600 odd men making our total about 1200 men apiece. We received 3 more a.m.c. men making 9 in all. The Seany Bee sailed about 6 P.M. & we followed on the Choon about 20 minutes after after having taken aboard more cattle sheep & vegetables etc.\n","50":"\n General cleaning up in morning. Spent Saturday afternoon unpacking drugs & felt quite at home.\n\nIt was a stirring sight the way each ship cheered as the Bee sailed slowly pass the Choon. Over 1000 men on each boat cheering wildly & signaling & singing, each picking out ones friend on the other ship. Today I was appointed Sergant & Dispenser for the voyage & there is much heart burning who is to be the other non com to supervise the other work. The sick are paraded twice a day & the doctor calls out to me Mist Tussi or Black as the case may be & leaves it to me.\n","51":" our course lay between the great barrier reef & the mainland & is wonderfully picturesque. We pass hundreds of islands with vegetation right to the water’s edge all looking bright & green. The sea is beautifully smooth scarcely a ripple & our voyage is truly a pleasure trip so far. At night we go on deck to enjoy the beautiful cool air & are generally rewarded by seeing a beautiful sunset.\n","52":" &","53":" The last three days a repetition. At times we are very close to the mainland & pass various Bays & Inlets the names of which we do not know but they look very inviting. At other times we thread our way between innumerable islands Today we loss sight of the Bee.\n","54":" was astonished to find that we had turned round * during the early morning & were on our way back. It appears that the Bee has run on to a reef or sandbank The scenery we passed on our way back when about an hour from Thursday Island\n\nJardine passage\n\nwas the best ever we seemed to take a different route. At one part we passed between two Islands each towering high above us with very little room to spare on either side. It was from here we saw the Bee stranded having taken about 6 hours on the return journey. About 10 oclock our ship had manoeuvred within a few hundred yards & tried to tow her off but with no success as the ropes parted each time. All attempts were given up during the afternoon & various rumours are floating about as to what is going to happen. About 8.30 another ship arrived & will probably assist in the morning. My days work generally consists of the following. Salt water bath 6.30 am Breakfast 7. 9 oclock attend to patients who come to me for treatment. Free till 11 oclock sick parade when the Doctor attends & all sick men are paraded by non coms for treatment. At these times I stand by & dole out physic as he orders at 1 oclock Patients under my care attend again. At 4 oclock Sick parade again At 5 oclock I see regulars again & after that treat special cases only. In the Hospital itself the other A.m.e. attend to the patients & I assist generally keeping an eye on everything Our meals are first class For breakfast we get fresh meat mutton or Beef & vegetables or perhaps a curry & Rice. Dinner fresh meats cabbage & potatoes For Tea Bread jam butter\n\n& cheese coffee or tea, Bread Butter Jam & cheese to every meal also Pickles & tomato sauce. Through being on the Hospital we have access to rice & tapioca puddings, Beef tea coffee cocoa etc also lime juice cordial Then amongst the Red Cross supplies is clothing of every description We are taking advantage of several cotton singlets for the hot weather Our Hospital contains about 26 beds with one isolation Hospital of 4 beds, 4 Electric fans are going daily which improves the air considerably.\n\nCockroaches are many & I am learning to look on them without repulsion. \n","55":" Put through about 100 men inoculation against typhoid & was done myself my arm being rather painful at present. All the morning was spent trying to tow the Seang Bee off the reef two 4\" hawsers & both ships giving full speed but some success. In the afternoon we manned a ships boat & rowed to the reef & had a delightful swim. It was a wonderful sight as we rowed around to gaze at the bottom. Beautiful coral all shapes & colors seaweed innumerable varieties huge sponges with variously coloured fish darting in & out. Swimming rather a risky proceeding as this evening we watched several sharks about, feeding on refuse from the ship. Two motor launches & one yacht are in attendance & it is a busy scene when all the ships boats are about\n\nas well. The Bee put a considerable quantity of coal overboard today for purposes of lightning the ship.\n\n Saturday. Made an early start on towing off the Bee & was successful cheer after cheer rang through the air as she slowly glided off the reef & headed north We followed passing through the same passage one of the most beautiful pieces of scenery I have witnessed. Rather a quaint feature was the mounds, red in colour caused by ants. The vegetation was beautifully green & reached to the waters edge except where a sandy beach interfered. After a few hours sailing we reached Thursday Island which is a small island amongst many. Very picturesque & prosperous looking a large number of Pearl luggers busy at anchor. We landed about six oclock & strolled through the town a mixed population Japs, Chows, Whites, Malays, niggers etc. The town did a roaring trade & several things were bought right out. I fear there will be trouble Quite a number of the men rushed the Hotels & at one place of questionable character numbers of men six deep were waiting their turn. We passed two small wrecks as we approached the island My purchases included an Ice cream & a soft drink which was most enjoyable Have had rather a strenuous time. Was awakened 3 A.M. Saturday morning by the guard bringing in a man suffering from Ptomaine \n\npoisoning. His pain was awful. As I was the only one who understood treatment I had to buck to. Towards daylight sent for doctor who came but did nothing left me to continue on as I had started. I fear he is very callous. The patient improved during the day & was discharged Monday. On top of that the men playing up on shore gave us additional work. I had turned in about 10 p.m. but was awakened several times as to treatment for cases etc & other shortly after 12 the Doctor called me up to assist with stomach pump on a man brought on board drunk & helpless. A messy job & one I did not feel fit for being bilious. Then another man had to have a cut face stitched & broken nose bandaged. The behaviour of many of the men is disgusting. I heard it said that only the best are enlisting. If so I am sorry for the worst. \n","56":" We left the wharf enabling the Bee to go alongside. Admitted a patient suffering from Pleurisy who took a bad turn after tea & had to have a man up all night. Once again Doctor leaves no instructions, all left to us, which means responsibility rests a lot on me as I’m supposed to know most Sent a telegram to mother & posted several postcards. Heard the five transports are in front. \n","57":"\n Pleurisy man still bad. Fairly large sick parade I had a mild dispute with Padre but all correct later. Left Thursday Island 8 A.M. & headed direct for Colombo. Steering due west ","58":"\n","59":" a quiet day sailing\n\nsteadily on to Colombo. Short am parade but have not yet heard the result. Twice during the night was awakened by the coughing of our worst patient & found the man on night duty asleep. ","60":" 25th ","61":" &","62":" Quiet monotonous days of ordinary routine mostly calm weather rough one day only, course mostly due west. Sighted some islands expect them to be Fort of Java. Several tons of potatoes condemned smell something awful had no idea potatoes could smell. It has rained at various times a little finding its way into the Hospital. My only trouble is biliousness owing to lack of exercise, my leg still bad although its 3 weeks today since I hurt it ","63":"\n 28 Fine day. Passing Java. Very mountainous. One Peak we saw soaring above the clouds was Simaru 1200 ft high Shaped as a pyramid & a beautiful sight the peak far above the surrounding clouds. The coast line rugged & broken & being very high seemed intermixed with clouds. Attended service at night hymn singing. Feeling much better in health. Had rather a funny case to the doctor today. A fellow came in with a very forlorn look & said I’ve a bad throat pains in the head & back an awful cough \n a touch of indigestion and I cant ------ he ended up with. The Doctor sat back & quaintly remarked H’m, you are what one might call B-----------d then. ","64":" Small operation today on a G. patient\n\npoisoning. His pains were awful. As I was the only one understanding treatment I had to buck too & towards daylight sent for Doctor. He came after much trouble but did nothing just shook his head & left me to it. I fear he is very callous. The patient improved during the day.\n\nHelped Ships doctor to give CHCl 3 Very successful patient extremely amusing on coming out of anaesthetic. A V shaped incision made rather an experience to see the scissors cutting through skin & flesh. \n","65":" ordinary routine work personally feeling much better. \n\n \nWednesday\n ","66":" admitted patient for appendicitis. Doctor decided to operate at dinner time & decided to get the doctor from \"Bee\" to assist. All that afternoon our boat tried to get into communication with the \"Bee\" by wireless but were unsuccessful & flags & Rockets were also used without success. At dark we had gained a little & after sending up seven rockets we succeeded in attracting her notice. We could see her turn sharply round & steam back to meet us. Both ships were then stopped till the operation was completed. I spent a good portion of the afternoon arranging the operating table, sterilizing instruments etc & getting everything ready. At 8.20 we started. The ships doctor had charge of the anaesthetic my duty being to pour the ChCl3 onto the mask. The appendix\n\nwas not removed owing to the fact I believe that it had already burst The whole case is of great value to us comprising treatment dressing of wound etc. \n","67":" Patient very cheerful & shows signs of speedy recovery. Before the operation the R.C. Chaplain gave the absolution. \n\n","68":" Usual routine \n","69":" crossed the Line 9.30 A.M. with usual ceremony. A few casualties in one of which I put 2 stitches. All the officers from the major down were dipped, then, the skipper & ships officers were treated in a like manner. Every part of the ship was ransacked, no part being sacred. The fun continued all the morning & into the afternoon when it was stopped owing to unnecessary roughness. Some hundreds were passed through.\n\n","70":" Usual routine. Some excitement as we are approaching Colombo. Attended Church Service at night \n","71":" Sighted land at daylight a series of undulating hills. As we approached Colombo we passed several fishing boats (Native) and sighted several vessels. We could see picturesque villas with tile roofs amongst a setting of cocoanut palms & one huge place The Galle Face Hotel stood out from all. After taking on the Pilot we came to and\n\nanchor about 1 P.M. Several barges loaded with coal in bags now approached also water boats & a start was made coaling. The coolies seemed numberless & were dressed with a dirty sheet wrapped round the middle. Several of the men commenced diving for money & were so quick that they always recovered it before it sank more than a few feet Tins of Bully Beef were freely passed out to the Coolies one of which struck one of the men on the head & made a gash. Judging by the dint in the tin it would have killed a white man. The coaling is done very rapidly being passed up by the men on to various platforms The water is pumped up from huge tanks in barges with \"Waeter Boat\" painted on them. The Seang Bee arrived 7 hrs after we did & took a birth close alongside. Our appendicitis patient was sent ashore being placed on a bed & hoisted onto a launch alongside. Two of our men accompanied the doctor ashore & had a good time coming back laden with good things & excitement.\n\nTuesday 9th The heads decided on a Route March & we landed by means of several barges. Myself & another went with M.O. to get supplies & were given leave for a few hours. The other troops marched out & returned\n\nto the ship about 1 P.M. leaving a good number ashore who broke away. The town is a fine one of good buildings & wide streets considering the native element being so prominent. At first we strolled along being accosted at every step by native to buy tobacco & curios being the most mentioned. We reached the post office & wrote several post cards home being attended to by a very civil attendant who procured pens & bought our stamps etc We then took Rickshaws to the Galle Face Hotel a palatial establishment on the ocean Beach when I got outside a large bottle of English Beer Then were taken through the Malay quarter back to the town centre. Entering a shop with the idea of buying something small I finished up by buying 2 dressing jackets & a silk scarf for my mother sister and sister-in-law respectively. We had a great go in our prices ending up by tossing up over a disputed shilling at which I won. Cost me 26\/- in all and 1\/1 postage. From here we took a Rickshaw to the native quarter & passed through the markets, getting a man to describe the different fruits & vegetables & showing us how to chew Betel nut. We bought Plantains & Pineapples to value of 3\/- having beaten them down in price somewhat. Returning we had dinner at the Bristol Hotel \n\ncost R2 (2\/8) & was first class. The sights such as the oriental shops are very interesting & the natives vary so. Some are most serious others smile & laugh without provocation according to their cast & race. The men mostly wear a waist cloth & the women have in addition a blouse when young they are extremely interesting & sometimes pretty but they excel with their eyes both them & the young men & children having beautiful eyes. The carts are old world affairs having mostly thatched covers & are drawn by oxen of various sizes & colours. Motor Cars & carriages are also common. A Rickshaw cost is 8d per hour or 50 cents although they generally get more from visitors Black crows abound everywhere & are quiet a feature. Cocoanut palms gives the scene a touch needful & are in large clumps everywhere especially along the beach. The moment a ship arrives it is surrounded by hundreds of boats of different kinds, catamarans dart in & out & the coloured waistcloths of the men the quaint boats & the white coverings of the fuelling boats all makes a picture Begging is second nature. As soon as a child can move it is instructed in the art. We returned to the ship & found our Doctor awaiting our arrival. Our boatmen attempted to overcharge us but we compromised\n\n& paid him half,","72":" for the two of us.\n","73":" No leave granted to men but some N.Coms spent the day in hunting up stragglers. I had a delightful swim around the ship although I believe sharks are prevalent. During the day Pro Ship NILE arrived packed with Indian soldiers from Singapore on the way to the front, cheers were exchanged between the transports. At 6.30 P.M. we weighed anchor & set off on the next stage of our journey.\n","74":" During the greater part of the day we had land in sight. The chief part being Cape . The sight was a fine one. With a background of high mountains with their tops enveloped in clouds, the foreshore being composed of what looked like Red granite & a sandy beach. Signs of habitation were many. On the most southern point we could see what appeared to be a Castle or Palace of white stone quite a formidable place. Vaccination was the chief item of the day. The doctor let me do most of it & I vaccinated over a hundred men. It is remarkable how different men take it. Some fear it & tremble at the scratch & others quite the opposite. One case we had was a dislocated wrist & we had to give chloroform to replace it. The man was very afraid & was with difficulty persuaded to have it. Said he would rather be shot.\n\nWhilst going off he became violent but soon subsided & I continued giving the anaesthetic whilst the doctor fixed up the wrist.\n","75":" Ordinary routine with addition of vaccination, put through about 100. This is our coolest day. The sea is still very calm practically no swell. Peculiar thing happened to me today whilst having tea. It suddenly flashed on me, as a thought wave how my mother views my going to the war. I have often tried to put myself in their place but failed utterly till today when it came to me in a flash, without me thinking of it. A fair instance of telepathy.\n","76":" . Nothing doing. A paper the ‘Seang Dune’ came out nothing original in it just the same old thing.\n","77":" Attended communion at 6 AM only 10 attended out of over 1000 soldiers Andrews officiated. At night had a good singsong of hymns.\n","78":" Usual day. Had notice to commence packing up. Second issue of Seang Dune out rather good.\n","79":" Usual day. At night had a ripping supper. An orderly to one of the officers has taken a fancy to me & brings dainties galore & for our supper we had the following Prawns, oysters, Salmon, Herring, tinned fruit cake & pudding besides the usual biscuits, bread & butter etc. Added to this we had three bottles of 1906 champagne given to us\n\nfrom supplies, by the doctor.\n","80":" St Patrick’s Day. Usual routine. Mild excitement over the Isolation Hospital being given to the sergeant’s for their mess as it restricted the deck space of the Privates. Concert at night given mostly over to Irish songs. Rather a good programme. At the end the Major in a very hesitating & a weak voice asked the men to stick by their officers & he would see about reducing fines inflicted for breaking leave at Colombo. Those who do behave themselves are being forced to think themselves fools for not having a good time by playing up. I heard rather a good story about the Line. A chap who had heard a lot about crossing the ‘line’ was told to go & ask the Captain to allow him to look through his telescope in order to see it. This the Captain did but pulled a hair from his head & held it in front. Well well I never said the fellow there it is as plain as possible & I can see a camel walking along it.\n","81":" Sighted land again having reached the Red Sea. Getting hotter. Nothing but sand & sand hills in sight. Some very lofty. Passed a prominent point known as Hell’s gate round which we turned & took a different course. Sighted a warship & other ships on their way. Much jubilation amongst the men as owing to a suspicious case we had to have the isolation Hospital back & the sergeant’s were ejected.\n\n19, 20,","82":" Still going through the\n\nRed Sea. Weather cool & beautiful but more rough than it has been the whole journey church at 9.30\n","83":" Passing through the Gulf of Suez, land close on both sides very interesting hilly, rocky, & sandy without a sign of vegetation. Received the second inoculation today & did some packing up. Arrived at Suez about 7PM & shortly after received news of some moment. The canal being blocked we were to land immediately & would ultimately proceed to Turkey. We therefore made another start on packing & left off about 1 AM in the morning.\n","84":" Rose early to complete packing as we were to land after breakfast. It was a fine sight in the early morning. Brown coloured hills on one side Suez on the other, the, water a beautiful bluey green & several steamers anchored around. There were two other transports also an armoured cruiser. Native boats came alongside to sell their wares of oranges cigarettes sweets etc. At 10.30 AM we went alongside to land & the first train left about 1 o’clock. We embarked on trains & left at 6 PM leaving Jones at the Garrison Hospital. We found various encampments of Sikhs etc. & received a good reception right along the route. At dusk I spread my blankets on the floor of the car & slept the sleep of the just. Passing one station Zagazig we got out for a stretch & to view the station We arrived at Cairo shortly after 1 AM & disembarked at a branch station loaded our kits onto wagons & the marched about 3 miles to camp arriving 3AM Wednesday\n\nmorning. Part of the journey was over lovely roads then we reached the desert & ploghed through deep sand. On arriving at camp we had tinned fish issued then turned in for a few hours sleep. It was very cold & we all felt it at first.\n","85":" We were placed in one of the messing sheds.. Having no rations issued we went to the canteen & after struggling for half an hour managed to get some bacon & eggs fried in olive oil for 3 piastres equal to 7½d. After that I had a bad time. A terrible headache came on and lasted till the afternoon. The Doctor not arriving I decided to see Cairo so went off about 5 oclock by tram a distance of about 3 miles from Abbassich camp where we were situated. Picking up some chap who had been here sometime I saw \nthings\n. It seems to me impossible to find a worse city for open vice. Soliciting goes on in the open street. In doorways, a few yards apart there would be several standing about surrounded by soldiers. From balconies they hung over & called to passerby & soldiers could be seen through the windows. Then passing up narrow alleyways we saw hundreds of such sights. Dancing exhibitions to be seen from P½ upwards. Then dotted here & there are drinking shops combined with a Vaudeville show. No charge to enter. Some turns fair others quite impossible. We had quite a good fish supper for P.6 & returned to camp about 10 P.M.\n","86":" Decided to find out where our corps. was encamped so walked to the next camp about 3 miles off, Heleopolis by name but found the 4th, Field Amb there. Then thinking to find Lance \n\namongst the New Zealanders I walked to the next camp called Zeitoun another mile off after enquiries was fortunate enough to find him as sergeant major in the A.S.C & very cocky & comfortable looking as usual. He was of course very surprised to see me as I was him. Back to camp for dinner and as no ration yet issued purchased some outside. Then I decided to go to mens camp to see Will D. & arrived out there about 5 oclock & had my first sight of the Nile & pyramids on the way out I passed a huge swarm of grasshoppers huge in size & so thick as to form a cloud. I had no pass but managed to pass the guard & found Will at his tea & joined him to his great surprise. After a good yarn I returned to Camp once more coming in the back way as before.\n","87":" Still no orders so set off for Cairo to spend the day Walked for miles viewing different parts of the town & had meals at the Soldiers Rest a café in Ezbekiah Gardens started by General Maxwell as well. The food is cheap & good & reading room, piano, draughts etc are all provided free. Saw two native funerals. Men lead the way singing the comes next followed by some women folk At night was conducted round the native quarter & witnessed sights innumerable. Dancing Singing etc. quite 2 miles I passed of dens etc all with their solitary women of different nationalities from black to white. Returned at night to find some of our chaps sent to their various units\n","88":" Spent the morning looking over \n\na curio shop then returned to camp & met Will Drummond & went around Cairo. \n","89":" met a friend now S. Baker who gave me two tents so shifted our quarters We also had orders to mess with the ninth so are in a fairway of becoming comfortable Into Cairo at night. Just like a weekday as Friday is the Mohommedans Sunday. \n","90":" nil. \n","91":" went to meet Will D. at Mena but he had already departed so spent the day there resting & looking at the pyramids & Sphinx will make another visit. \n","92":" \n\nGiven duties at last. Attended sick parade & had to make an inventory of natives employed in Camp. They totalled 1500. \n","93":" orders came to pack up & join our unit at once: our kits were placed on a wagon & we marched to the tram where we entrained for Mena. We arrived there to find the men out on a route march. \n","94":" Church parade in morning was very disappointing. A very imposing square was formed & General Bridge attended but service was flat, no singing worth mentioning. Remainder of day, a holiday & spent the time doing Photos with Will. D. At night we took candles & went through all three pyramids refusing the service of a guide. The first pyramid Cheops was fairly easy the biggest danger being from slipping for which purpose shoes or bare feet are necessary. The passage way is worn\n\n like glass & steps are cut to make walking possible. Most of the way one has to stoop. It is here that the huge blocks of stone are seen We next did the third pyramid the passage ways being much rougher . The second is the most difficult, a part of the passage being 1 foot only high for about 12 feet along which one has to riggle on ones stomach in the dust & dirt. \n","95":" &","96":" At morning parade orders were given to immediately pack up for the front We were allowed to take two blankets & what we could carry on our haversacks my extras being socks, 1 shirt, towel, soap, hairbrush, shaving kit & toothbrush. Hospital tents were rolled up & placed on wagons, supplies checked, camp site cleaned up & rubbish burnt, Different fires throughout the camp showing where the men were leaving. Rations were issued for the next 24 hours. At 6 P.M. we were all ready to move off, which we did about 7 & marched to Cairo, a distance of 10 miles We arrived at the station about 11 & & were dismissed for few hours as train was not ready for us. Several laid out to sleep but t’was very cold. Some of us found a café & had supper then went into a hotel & had a jolly time, dancing singing etc till the fall in sounded at 3.30 A.M. We then marched into the station & were placed in 3rd Class carriages at 5.30 AM we moved out for Alexandria I managed to get about 2 hours sleep by 7 AM We arrived at Alexandria about 11 AM. \n\nAfter passing through splendid agricultural country. Native villages were everywhere \n\nconstructed of mud. The dwellings are low with flat roofs mostly, some have domes used for their pigeons which they value highly. Their donkeys fowl etc all live together with the family. Women work in the fields & tiny children are seen driving donkeys. Irrigation is everywhere worked by waterwheels turned by oxen. Coming up to the harbour I counted 8 German prizes in one row. Our transport is a moderately sized vessel named the City of Benares. Although leave was not given at night there was nothing to stop us going of the boat but I was unable to see Alexandria as my last cent was spent on an orange.\n","97":" Spent a good night on the floor with two blankets. Most of day was spent completing the loading of vessel & we sailed about 4 p.m. all standing to attention. On the wharf one of the natives disputed a price with one of our men & then knocked off his hat. You B – B –s he said, picked him up & threw him into the harbour where he was fished out by his friends The incident caused great amusement on the ship & no doubt taught the fellow a lesson. The harbour is packed with shipping & of transports are about some landing English soldiers, others embarking Australians. Good Friday night there was a riot in Cairo\n\nSome fellows who had come to grief in one of the houses of the Wazi quarter returned to seek vengeance & a Maori was stabbed during the trouble. This started the others going & furniture was freely thrown into the streets & set alight. An iron bedstead happened to land on a soldiers head who was looking on & killed him while several wounded by the Redcaps (the English picquets) who appear to have arrived late & they fired indiscrimately into the mob. What damage was done & how many killed & injured it seems impossible to find out accurately as various rumours are afloat. I asked a Greek Hotel keeper what he thought was the cause of the trouble & he replied with the proverb that one stone by itself cannot make flour, it requires two stones.\n\nTuesday\nMonday 5th Spent the day loading the ammunition column & Engineers gear & sailed at 4 or 5 P.M. All standing to attention Towards dark evidences of a rough trip was not wanting & all seemed glad to turn in early. At breakfast next morning many places were vacant a big proportion of the men being sick The sea was not very rough but a strong breeze, beam on, caused the ship to roll heavily. The chaps were leaning over the side in dozens & every now & again one would rush out from the mess room with an agonized look on his face straight for the rail. \n","98":" The day was sunny but it rained at intervals during the day. Will D was ill but fortunately\n\nI was O.K. & came up for meals like an old sailor. This night I slept under the table in the mess room. This is my first experience of roughing it since I left Sydney. There are over 600 men on board & no sleeping accommodation is provided, probably because ‘tis to be a short trip & the men sleep in all sorts of places. At night I slept near the Cook house on an iron floor with a plank of wood for a pillow & thought myself fortunate in getting such a position \n\n","99":" were floating around concerning our destination etc but we had definite news in the afternoon. At dinner time we were told to fall in at 2 oclock with full kit & everyone rushed to obey the order with the result the chaos rained for a time as everyone wished to be in the same spot at one time. At last we were all on deck & the different stretcher parties were picked out from each section. Myself & five others from the Reinforcements being utilized. Then we were given rations for two days & told that we would probably land in Turkey under fire & as water would be scarce to drink as much as possible before landing & to have full water bottles Ammunition was distributed to the soldiers & al seemed prepared for the final phase & the end of our training was in sight with the real thing to take its place. We sighted various islands of the Greek archipelago & arrived off Lemnos late in the afternoon. A Torpedo destroyer was lying about a mile from the entrance & as we steamed slowly into the \n\nthe harbour a large Battleship steamed slowly & stately out. She shewed signs of being in action, half of the rear mast was carried away & big splashes of white on different parts of her hull shewed where she had been hit. We all had to stand to attention as we passed one another. Inside lay the Queen Elizabeth with here 8 – 15\" guns & several smaller boats as well as one Russian Cruiser & a Frenchy, one Hospital ship several transports & colliers. On the slopes of the hills were dotted numerous tents containing we believe our 3rd brigade. Oranges are now going strong. We can buy them over the side for 6’ a dozen. \n","100":" At anchor in Lemnos Harbour alongside another transport. We have just heard that Bulgaria has joined Turkey. Poor Bulgaria. Today I was called for guard for the first time & have to put in 24 hours. 4 on & 8 off. It is very tiring to stand for 4 hours as there is no room to do a proper walk. The horsemen exercised round the deck today with much slipping stamping & playing up in general. There is no further news of landings & we have to be content to gaze on the green slopes of Lemnos & dream of the orange groves. There will be a few less of us to dream however shortly. My sentry duty proved more enjoyable than I thought possible. For my second spell I was called at midnight & did till 4 A.M. the time went by fairly quickly & gave me ample time for thought I decided that I would not change my present position for one in Australia for anything.\n\n","101":" Was dismissed from guard at 8 A.M. having completed 24 hours. Parade in morning was allotted position in boat for landing party & in afternoon we climbed down the rope ladder & went or a practice row finishing up by racing the other boat to the ship. So far as I could see there are 12 transports in the harbour besides some extra warships There must be something doing.\n","102":" 10 &","103":" Number of transports now doubled & more coming in every day, coupling the ships in pairs to save room. A hydroplane was also flying round during this morning. Andrews and MacGregor conducted church parade this morning & did rather well Have just had a lovely bath, in a bucket, quite a luxury as the delay in landing us is making the water very scarce. \n\n","104":" &","105":" Still waiting, weather turned cool again. More transports still arriving quite filling up the harbour. The heads held another conference today on the Queen Eliza which points to something doing. Received our mail caused great excitement. Hundreds of letters & papers which the chaps eagerly waited for then retired to devour in silence. No letters for me from home so rather wrath but received four from outsiders. \n","106":" Still at anchor. Was told off as butchers fatigue party to carry meat & managed to lose myself & when a party of men were wanted for a boat I managed to get down the ladder in time. We rowed to one transport to pick up a man then to the shore to pick up an officer. \n\nThere we had an hour to spare & roamed around the place & made various purchases of nuts figs etc. It was good to get ashore again. A mail was distributed in the evening & I received one from Fan. \n","107":" Acted as mess orderly today & came in contact with a corporal. He sat down at my table to write thereby causing much inconvenience to me cleaning up. Being asked to shift he declined saying that he was privileged I told him that I had no wish to quarrel but was met with insolence so called up a sergeant who promptly removed him telling him he ought to have more sense. During the day some of the chaps thanked me for taking a stand against a non-com. ","108":" Nothing to chronicle except the receipt of two letters one from Fan & one from Mum, very welcome indeed. \n","109":" My birthday. 27 years old. Time is passing quickly & I seem to be getting very old My last birthday was spent in London, where will I have the next?. This morning we rowed ashore & had a short march to the top of a hill. From here I counted 50 transports the warships being too much mixed up with colliers etc to get their number. Saw the submarine cruising around again today as well as a couple of mine sweepers Ian Hamilton was on shore so expect something to be doing shortly. The land shews an almost entire absence of trees. Fig trees being the only ones in sight, poppies & other flowers amongst the corn reminded me of English fields \n","110":" Have just been informed that I am to return with a party to look after sick returning to Alexandria. Although I managed to get someone\n\nto exchange with, the powers that be would not stand it so I must return. As I have not given any facts about Egypt I will do so now. From Dec 1 to April 30 is the tourist season which of course is non ext because of the war. The people are glad we are hear as we spend all we receive & it is money spread over a large portion of the community & mostly that portion most in need of it. We spend much more than the ‘terriers for not only do we spend more but we receive more. The Australian soldier thinks nothing of dining at the best Hotel where the officers congregate but the English soldier never. In regard to physique those who are competed to judge say that it has never been equaled by any other force. The climate is first rate warm days cool nights & practically no rainfall. The trams are a great convenience & are much used by the soldiers. They are exceedingly cheap from Mena to Cairo 9 or 10 miles costing 2 ½’ The medley of population is of great interest There are Egyptians, Soudanese Arabs, Bedouins & Greeks Syrians French & English as the main population. In addition Turks Nubians Montenegrins & others abound & tis quite an interesting study being able to distinguish between them. There are women wearing the burquah, a black veil over the lower half of the face with brass ornaments like a double cotton reel down the centre of the forehead to the bridge of the nose & others wearing the Yasmak the same as above but while being the Turkish\n\nform. They do not conceal but make the wearer appear more fascinating. Religions are various & many, Mussulmen Copts Protestant Catholic etc Buying anything is quite an art & was much like my experience in Colombo. On asking for an article a great row commences, sounds like word warfare & the article is then produced There is actually no heat in their talk. I am told it is just their excited habit but practically everything can be bought in the street. Every second man appears to have something to sell They thrust their wares upon one & no sooner do you get rid of him than another approaches Guides are very troublesome in some quarters & take some shaking off. Boys who clean boots a are almost as thick as flies and he who caries not a stick has difficulty in getting rid of them. Their cry is generally Clean boots Mr. Mackenzie No good, no money, Kiwi Australia very good or so on … At 2 oclock we formed up without kit & proceeded to the boat but orders had just come to stand by so we remained where we were. Then hearing that a boat was going out I bustled round & managed to get on. We rowed towards the Elizabeth Queen & seeing others going aboard we did the same & found ourselves on the greatest battleship afloat. It was a wonderful sight not an inch of waste gear, the huge 15\" guns 8 of them, standing out seeming to dominate everything. We examined the air craft guns\n\nin fact everything possible. I managed to take a photo on the deck as well as one of the whole ship. Although newly painted up we could see where she had been hit the funnels especially, being pierced in several places & patched up in others. We were the envy of the ship on our return\n\n","111":" I had orders again pack up for Hospital ship but when all was ready were told again to stand by. Received a mail from London & was answering same when I was called up for fatigue duty. It consisted of carrying shells to the aft deck up a steep staircase. We started at 4 P.M. & with a spell for tea, kept going till 8.15. each case weighed over a cwt & it was quite the most strenuous work done by me to date. \n","112":" nothing more heard of going to Alexandria. Practised bandaging during the day. Weather cold & bleak. Managed to get a good snap of submarine 28. \n","113":" called for guard duty & appointed to 3rd shift. When about to go on received order to pack up to go to other ship. We did so but heard no more that day. Weather wet cold & dispiriting.\n","114":" Began to think we were not to go after all. Orders read out concerning treatment of native villages. Moslem quarter out of bounds & prices to be regulated etc. About 10 a.m. we were again ordered to pack up the Colonel himself appearing & assuring us that we would rejoin unit very soon. We embarked on a minesweeper late trawler \"Avon\" of Grimsby. Then we called on various other ships \n\nfrom one of which we took 11 AMC men belonging to 3rd Fd Amb. Steaming past the Queen Elizabeth, then Prince of Wales & other battleships we arrived at the A15. Clan McGillvray our destination. There we had a portion of deck space given us, no other accommodation being available & received an issue of Biscuits & Bully beef. The night was fine but cold but with help of Great coal managed to keep warm. Should it rain again we will suffer as we have no shelter whatever.\n","115":" awoke refreshed & breakfasted on porridge burnt, cheese jam & biscuits. Having inherited the ability to eat anything, a trifle such as burnt porridge worries me not & I made a hearty breakfast but my fellows are very indignant about the food. The ship is overcrowded about 200 men having to sleep & mess on the deck in all weathers. For lunch we had Bully Beef stewed & Potatoes but no bread. During the day we bought some eggs from a Greek which was a welcome change for tea about 4 P.M. we noticed several of the transports leaving the harbour as well as some cruisers the transports anchoring just outside the harbour. One of them was our late boat the City of Benares the Battalion has a splendid band in fact two one of Pipes & at night it is very enjoyable to have the bands playing. This was the last night for them to play, their instruments being packed up & sent to the base. Some hundreds of wooden water carriers were brought aboard designed to carry two Kerescene tins of water each,. One on each side of a packhorse or mule. Those tins have been filled & sealed up for some days past. The question of water is a big one in this campaign\n\nspent a good night on deck quite warm with two blankets & great coat \n\n","116":" was awakened 5 A.M. by our vessel getting under weigh. We steamed slowly out being followed by three others & came to anchor in a bay which appears to be the other side of the island from our late Harbour. The instructions etc. given to the men were as follows. Three days rations, some chocolate only to be used as a last resource, take a big drink before going & take full waterbottles, 200 rounds of ammunition, no lights of any kind to be shewn. Breakfast at 4 A.M. then to land by means of destroyers special caution as to treatment of inhabitants. A proclamation read out which is being circulated amongst the villages, assures the Turks that they the Allies are doing nothing but delivering them from the yoke of a Foreign Power & that their rights etc will not be interfered with. They must not leave their homes between the hours of sunset & sunrise. About 12 vessels are now lying there & more are arriving. Spent the afternoon fixing up the Dispensary. \n\n Sunday We left our anchorage at 11 P.M. with pleasurable anticipations & awoke next morning to the call of the officers at 3 A.M. We could then see the other transports coming through the darkness all creeping silently along. Breakfast at 4 A.M. then commenced the landing by means of torpedo boats. The sound of firing came to our ears & a feeling of pleasure & excitement caused me to feel sorry for those not here. But twas soon to be changed. The enemy had prepared defences & our boys met with heavy fire before they put foot ashore. Machine guns were posted up in the hills & simply poured a hail of lead in the boats. One was sunk & a few drowned those who reached the beach fixed bayonets & charged to cover & vainly attempted to\n\nendeavoured to sight the enemy but they soon came in personal contact with him by means of the bayonet several trenches being won. The boats returning brought back some wounded & patches of blood were seen on the deck in various places. Imagine the feelings of the boys whose turn it was disembark next.! From this our wounded were brought along in a continuous stream The Hospital was filled. The mess tables were ripped up from below, blankets spread down & the men were laid here as closely as possible. Before long every available space was covered & we began to refuse men & send them to the Hospital ship. When she filled up taking 600 she immediately sailed for Alexandria Then we had to receive more, placing them on the deck until there was hardly a spare space left At times it was the utmost difficulty getting them on board. Some arrived in fuelling boats & had to be lifted onto stretchers, then into the cot in order to sling them aboard. This work was very difficult as the boat pitched about a good deal & owing to the confined space the work was very severe. This went on all day practically without cessation. The Battle ships during this time were shelling the hills & searching the ridges. Only once did the Turks return this fire several shells falling round us & causing many of the transports to bustle & get out of range. Seeing the sufferings of the wounded awoke in me a great rage & as I carried them about on stretchers I swore as I had not done before. Our boys did extremely well but the absence of artillery till next day was a heavy handicap & during\n\nthe day the time came when our chaps could not go further & retired a short distance. The Turks seemed to have the range to perfection. We could see the shrapnel bursting & it caused great havoc Officers had a bad time several companies being depleted altogether I will never forget","117":" I really believe it will mark an era in Australian history. On this day Australians proved themselves. They landed under heavy fire, a thing rarely attempted & never flinched once & the result was victory. Our men were deliberately picked for the honour and proved that the trust shown in them was not misplaced. A captain assured me that 40 % casualities were spoken of & expected. Would Kitchener send anyone to such a job? Just on dusk a cruiser came close to us & heavily bombarded the Turks. At each broadside our ship quivered & the noise was deafening. I was in a fuelling boat alongside getting wounded out at the time & twas almost unbearable the shells going almost over our heads & the concussion changed a calm sea into a choppy one causing our boats to rock terribly. It was a relief to get on board again. During the night fitful firing was heard but the main thing was that our artillery was landed & took up there position \n","118":" dawned & the battle was still going on but the Turks began to get a little of what our chaps had suffered shrapnel bursting over their lines continuously. We had still a quantity of rations & ammunition to unload so could not leave for Alexandria\n\nOur A.M.C. consisted of about 36 all from different units & inexperienced. We had two doctors one a loafer pure & simple & they both seemed so taken aback by things that they did not attempt to dress wounds till Tuesday. From then one of them worked splendidly but the other man was almost a passenger Some of our chaps did what they could but at first it was little. We had over 900 wounded who had to be fed etc & other wants fixed up & we received 16 loaves of bread per day for their food. The result was hard biscuits were used by the A.M.C. & the majority of the wounded. \n","119":" Received a visit from a General & then we received orders to sail for Alexandria. This day the Doctor worked well & many of the worst cases were bandaged again, only first aid being attempted however. My duties were chiefly concerned with the Dispensary giving hypodermic injections & opium for pain at night. We got through pints of it My first day I put in 22 hours out of 24 getting practically no sleep for the first few days each night getting better however Many were minor wounds but some were very serious & we had about 20 deaths. Many were the miraculous escapes Just to mention a few cases, struck in the head while lying down the bullet glanced off ran along the skull & protruded half an inch out of the forehead, bullet passed through both cheeks in several cases, from temple to temple\n\nstruck the identification disc, glanced off & just left a flesh wound, a shell struck a water bottle leaving a bruise only, a wristlet watch shattered, a sailor stooping to pull a boat ashore received a bullet up the anus he afterwards died & so on. The smell of blood was everywhere & later when some of the wounds such as shot in the throat & a section of face blown off began to form pus it was awful to dress the wound. \n","120":" now steaming to Alexandria All hands busy dressing wounds. Myself mostly engaged at dispensary & injecting morphia when necessary Another job was to supply Iodine & dressings etc to all. Did the rounds at night with opium about 200 taking draughts. \n\n","121":" Still fine weather. Arrived at Alexandria about dusk & M.O. went ashore to arrange about landing wounded. It was decided to land 60 of the worst cases & the motors arriving at 12 P.M. we commenced & finished up about 4. A.M. Turned in for 2 hours sleep \n","122":" Up early & was glad to be able to get a supply of oranges, as tucker lately not of the best. The motors arrived again about midday & we landed about 250 more bad cases this being all the Hospitals could take the balance having to go to Malta. Tried to get leave but was unsuccessful could only sneak along to the next ship & see some men of my unit. Here they had 2 Turkish wounded\n\n& whilst I was there a New Zealander came up and commenced to taunt & bait one of them but the good feeling of those around predominated. A Scotchman then told the Turk with what pleasure he would run him through but ended up by shaking hands.\n","123":" morning about 2 A.M. we sailed for Malta. Now things changed for the better less work to do the worst cases being ashore, more bread & better food to eat & altogether we had time to look about. The sea was beautifully calm with the real Mediterranean Blues\n","124":" All serene helped Doctor to extract bullets doing about 13 of them, mostly shrapnel\n","125":" Still lively weather ideal for traveling, our duties now very light everyone looking forward to Malta.\n","126":" Arrived at Malta 6 A.M. & anchored in Harbour of Sleima a quarantine harbour I believe. Pontoons came alongside onto which we landed our wounded . Word was then given that no leave was to be granted & sentries were posted around the ship. It wasn’t long before several stole ashore & came back in the evening with glowing tales of the city.\n","127":" A lovely day with the city lying enticingly before us. During the morning some of the bad’uns traded all they could get hold of in the way of bully beef & what they could steal such as scales opera glasses etc. over the side for spirits & became hopelessly drunk. After\n\nnoon came &I decided to go ashore. Three of us then took a boat ashore to Sleima cost 6d. each. Everything was spotlessly clean & we wandered around the place viewing things. The streets are narrow & hilly & the buildings are all of one type a creamy stone with perhaps green casements. The milk used is from goats & herds of these animals are driven through the streets & milked where necessary. They appear to yield a lot of milk having abnormally large udders. Wishing to take a photo I came on an old woman milking but she was extremely nervous & blushing hurried along but I followed up & with the help of a penny at last persuaded her to pose for a snapshot. We next encountered a Maltese lacemaker & watched operations which were extremely interesting, 36 threads on reels in one case being used at once. After some bargaining I managed to get some at a reasonable price & posted it home. We then took Cab & drove to Valletta the main township where we were the object of all eyes. The womenfolk wear a peculiar headgear called the Faldett a kind of hoop over the head. Altogether the day was most enjoyable a good dinner & supper completing the bill & after visiting sundry shops & making purchases we returned to the ship about 10 P.M. to find no notice taken of our action. They possess peculiar watercarts the water running into a tin with small holes, like a jamtin & this is\n\nwaved from side to side by the man walking behind. English money only is used & is much spoken. The Maltese language being very much like Arabic. At the entrance to the harbour is a huge fort & guns are very prominent in different parts.\n","128":" sailed 7A.M. for Lemnos & arrived Saturday night the trip being uneventful & blessed with fine weather throughout. Passing through the Greek Archepelgo we had a fine view of various islands. It must be vary extensive as it was quite 24 hours before we left it behind. I took the opportunity to wash my pants & tunic one night & left them to dry in the Engine room so I feel clean once more. In addition I managed to procure a Khaki shirt, pair of sox underpants shirt Balaclava etc. replenishing my wardrobe completely. Our food has also been changed the rations being issued to us very sparingly & we often go hungry. Sick parade has been instituted & I keep the dispensary locked up which enables me to keep my kit safe.\n","129":" Spent the day lying in Lemnos Harbour idle except for sick parades. Lovely weather & cool nights. Had a good go in with walnuts once more. \n","130":" Joined a boat party & rowed to the French Camp at Mudros for supplies. It was a fairly long & stiff row especially coming back. We spent about an hour ashore seeing things. The most interesting being the Turkish prisoners. At night we had\n\norders to proceed further into the harbour.\n","131":" Was chosen for another boat party in which we took the Doctor, Padre & Chief Engineer first to the Reliance a Repair ship, & then to the shore. The Reliance is a wonderful ship & capable of doing any work. Her decks below are a mass of machinery & belting & and the quarters assigned to the workmen & crew are first rate. We landed on the pier & after watching the Turk prisoners unloading potatoes proceeded up into the village. Here we met some French soldiers & we managed to carry on some sort of conversation. They shewed us their wounds & then the Sergeant conducted us to a wine shop & we drank each others health vive la France, Anglais, Russia & Serb being the toast. Then we wandered round the village & witnessed some Greeks doing their national dance nothing much to witness, merely a succession of hops etc backwards & forwards. The houses are peculiar having very low roofs & being set down anywhere, no fences anywhere but they jut into the street making that merely a track winding in & out. The school was interesting & I gazed in at the door & watched the youngsters reciting their lessons. They are all of a stolid type very like the Dutch type of face with close cropped heads Altogether there were 500 prisoners all variously employed such as road making & building a new pier & they moved about their work slowly & with a hangdog appearance. The dress is much the \n\nthe same as the Ferriers in colour so much so that a naval man standing close by was taken for a Turk by one of the French Algerians & told to get a bristle on. The ownership of this island appears very doubtful & Admiral Wemyss was asked who did own it but he replied that he did not know all he knew was that he was Governor. Mudros is the military area & special regulations are in force controlling the movement of the inhabitants. Owing to the presence of a submarine, hostile, all lights out is insisted on at 8.30 p.m.\n","132":" Heavy rain during the night. Had the extreme honour of being asked to make up a boat crew & told by the Captain that I was a good man took stroke again. We rowed the Chief Engineer to the Reliance for some repairs & managed to get some news concerning events. Coming back we called at the Clan Macrae for news but nothing new She had Indians on board with Soudanese & Maltese 500 donkeys for Transport 300 goats & 250 sheep. During the afternoon the No. 1 General Stationary Hospital came on board from shore & we expect to sail tonight for Dardanelles. Sailed about 6 oclock & after waiting outside for orders continued on our way about 8 p.m.\n","133":" awoke in morning to the boom of guns & found ourselves at Cape Hellas. We steamed through a fleet of ships mostly French some of which were landing troops & horses then proceeded up the coast to where the Australians had landed, we circled several ships lying here & then returned to Cape Hellas & after drifting round anchored opposite the mouth of the Dardanelles. Our Captain had been looking for the ship to which the Hospital had to tranship\n\nbut she is not here at present. All day we have gazed on the land & through the glasses could distinguish the camp life. Horses moving & transport etc. Aeroplanes have been busy all day & we counted 16 shrapnel shells fired at one man all of which appeared to us to miss badly. The Fort on the Cape is a mass of ruins, as is also several buildings in the vicinity. We can plainly see the ship which was specially prepared & run ashore to assist in the landing of the troops. Three large holes were cut in each side to allow of guns being used. We have seen a dummy battleship known as H.M.S. Tiger No 2 She carries one genuine gun the rest being dummies About midday the Turks commenced firing from the Asiatic side & one shell landed close to the camp but one of our guns replying, it was soon silenced. Towards evening we disembarked the Hospital onto a mine sweeper & then returned to the old spot & anchored for the night all lights being muffled. \n","134":" Awoke to hear the muffled roar of guns on shore & the echo of each shot was returned from the hills. Then orders came to return to Lemnos much to the disgust of everyone. We were followed by the other ships, the presence of a hostile submarine evidently making it dangerous to lie out in the open. In the evening our Doctor & Ships Captain were taken off & various latrines were immediately floated. \n\nSaturday 15th Still lying at anchor in glorious weather. Several ships leaving for Alexandria. A few points about Malta. 17 ¼ miles long 9 ¼ miles broad. 60 miles coastline 95 square miles area Gozo\n\n 9 miles x 5 Highest point Malta 750 ft.\n\nOne third is bare rock but remainder being very fertile with irrigation much is accomplished by cultivation of orange, grapes, figs, peaches etc. The Maltese are hardy & industrious & are noted for their keen bargaining proclivities. The peasantry lived extremely plainly & seen to subsist & rear families on very little Their dwellings are small & flatroofed of stone & are huddled together. Shoeless & in rags the dwellers of the villages bargain for their food in the early morning, which consists of coarse bread & slice of gourd & this lasts the day. There is always a church mostly large & the priests hold complete sway. Cigars are sold at 10d for 100 English coinage is in use but a copper coin of old date is also used, value 10 to a penny. The boatmen show wonderful skill mostly standing up in their boats or Dghaisas to scull. These boats are built on graceful lines with the keel continuing above the gunwale at each end to a height of about 3 or 4 feet. Valletta & Floriana a suburb occupy the promontory between the harbour of Marsamuscetto & the Grand Harbour with Fort St Elmo n its extremity. About 1\/6 of the total population is congregated here , which is about 190000. The streets are narrow & hilly, the chief of which Strada Reale possesses the most important buildings. The Church of St. John built 1573 for the Order of St John is magnificent inside & ranked at one time as one of the richest in Europe \n","135":" In the evening too the Doctor to the ‘Arragon’ a fine troop ship. Whilst he was engaged we spent good hour talking to some Jack Tars hearing all the news & getting a good idea of operations in general. We were given a graphic description of the ‘Goliath’ disaster, also how two British Destroyers were sunk in the North Sea by the Vengeance & Goliath in mistake. They did not answer the challenge in time. When we arrived back on our ship we were shouted to a ‘Bass’ each for our exertions. \n","136":" Orders to pack up to move to the ‘Galeka’ which we did at midday. Here were gathered all the remnants & details of A.M.C. Infantry etc. She proved to be a much more comfortable ship for traveling. I met several pals here & swapped experiences. \n","137":" Sailed for Dardanelles 5 A.M. Towards evening we landed about 250 Infantry who had recovered from wounds & they were very glad to get ashore once more During the day the battleship did some shelling of Turkish positions & one village to which Turks had taken guns received an awful doing & burst into flames. We could see each shell land & then a fountain of earth & debris would be hurled into the air. Only one thing was left, a spire or minaret to a mosque which stood out white & distinct. How they managed not to hit it was remarkable. During the night the Turks made an attack on our trenches & the roll of volleys & machine guns lasted till dawn.\n\nThe day was interesting as we witnessed a fine bombardment. \n\nTuesday 18th. About 4 A.M. we left the Dardanelles for Imbros & anchored in a bay containing several Battleships & transports Here the SI. came alongside & we discharged cargo into her. Hay etc. \n\nWednesday 19th. Was on fatigue duty in the morningay etc. \n\nWednesday 19th.\n\n Sending up hay & oats from the hold. We sailed for Cape about 10 A.M. & on our arrival began to take on wounded. There had been a strong attack by the Turks, quite the heaviest engagement since the first landing. The Turks only managed to storm one trench but were bayoneted & driven out again. They suffered heavy loses, our fellows having the upper hand throughout. It started about 1 A.M. the Turks creeping up & at dawn they made their effort. I hear that the stench from unburied dead is awful & until our chaps advance it cannot be altered. The arrangements for wounded on this ship are splendid a marked contrast to our last. The Doctors with coats off, buckled to & the cases were treated immediately & refreshments were distributed to the men. It was very gratifying to see as our last experience was awful, some of our last wounded are here again, it seems hard that immediately on their return they catch it again there is one consolation they will get proper treatment. Our unit is not being utilized for the wounded the work being carried out by the Light Horse, 3rd, & New Zealanders. There are so many A.M.C. men aboard that there is not work enough for all. \n\nThursday 20th, Still taking on wounded & familiar faces still \n\nThe undermentioned message was received and read out to the troops on","138":"\n\nFrom\n\nGeneral Sir Ian Hamilton\n\n‘Soldiers of France & or our King\"\n\nBefore us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war. Together with our comrades of the fleet, we are about to force a landing upon an open beach in face of positions which have been vaunted, by our enemies as impregnable. The landing will be made good by the help of God & the navy. The positions will be stormed & the war brought one step nearer to a glorious close. \"Remember\" said Lord Kitchener when bidding adieu to your commander, Remember, once you set foot upon Gallipoli Peninsular you must fight the thing through to a finish\" The whole world will be watching our progress. Let us prove ourselves worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us\" \n\n(Sgd.) Ian Hamilton (General)\n\nappearing . The operating table is still busy & I just witnessed a leg being confined to the deep. A plaint of one of our men was the fact that in the trenches, a wounded man is often walked on by his pals in fighting such as yesterday. ’Tis impossible to move them for the time & with Turks charging all attention is riveted on them & the trenches being very narrow to pass along it one must step over or walk on anyone lying down. It must make our men wild to feel a pal underfoot.\n\nFriday 21st Once more on the move & to Imbros again Landed General Carruthers here, a fine type of man so far as I can gather. Nothing doing bar the trying out of a monoplane. Since we were here last a boom has been placed across the Harbour mouth evidently owing to rumours of submarines & Torpedo boats being about. My time is beginning to drag once more, necessitating me playing patience with cards. \n\nSaturday 22nd. Left Imbros for Lemnos & arrived about 11 A.M. Orders were brought on board on our arrival & we passed further up into the Harbour passing a large number of French ships. After dinner we went alongside the \"Franconia\" a huge Cunarder and transferred all our slightly wounded cases receiving in turn a dozen or so severe cases. The Franconia had on board some 1300 wounded mostly in cabins but the whole Hospital arrangements were splendid & the food issued was superior to most ships. The question of food appears to depend on the O.C. or ships officers some getting a splendid turn out whilst others manage on biscuits & bully beef. \n\nSunday 23rd. Doing general duties once more. Started off by having to holy stone No 3 deck, some work. In afternoon had the somber duty of rowing two corpses ashore for burial, a very sad sight but one becoming very common. I think of their people at home. After this duty we rowed to the main pier & went ashore soon forgetting our late task I photographed the large Greek Church in Mudros. Then had a wine & was ‘shouted’ another by a (continued on Page 60)\n\nCopy of the Proclamation issued to the Inhabitants of the Gallipoli Peninsula\n\nThe Military Forces of the Allied Powers have been obliged to occupy some portions of your country in order to save you from the hands of those persons who have attempted to place you under the domination of a Foreign Power, treading under foot the honour of your country. Your forces by land are crushed, your forces by sea are imprisoned in their harbours & reduced to impotence. Your treasury is empty. The Famine & destitution which reigns throughout your land has reduced you all to misery. The Governments of England & France under whose administrations millions of Moslems live have come to your assistance in order to assure to you the prosperity & happiness which is enjoyed by your co-religionists. There is no need to fear. Your honour lives & property are safe. Everybodies religion will be respected! With this just object in view, the following proclamation has been issued.\n\n1. The Village Administration will be in the hands of the Muktar as before & there will be no interference with your private affairs.\n\n2. In order that your women may move freely about, a portion of the market place has been set aside for the local inhabitants.\n\n3. In order to avoid regrettable incidents, sentries will be placed around the Moslem quarter.\n\n4. Women can go freely to the market from - to -.\n\n5. Nobody must leave their house between sunset & sunrise.\n\n6. Those who wish to sell to the soldiers must apply to the Muktar who will fix the prices at which goods are to be sold.\n\n \n\n7. Whoever has any cause of complaint should state his case to the Muktar.\n","139":" Anyone who attempts to escape from the village or who perpetrates any act of hostility against the allied forces or acts in a manner contrary to the provisions of the proclamation is warned that he will be dealt with in a very severe manner. \n\n(continuing on from P. 58) French soldier. Then proceeded through the village buying a Daily Telegraph 5d & 6d of spring onions. We then returned to our ship. We saw a new French regiment landed No 175 all in their blue clothing. Their packs appeared lighter than ours but seemed to have more articles in the way of mess tins. One of the men pointed to his boots & said Anglais we evidently supplying their footwear. I also managed to get a French bullet, they are copper covered & taper to a sharp point.\n","140":" Had order to quit ship. Spent the morning loading stores onto a lighter, real wharfies work. After dinner embarked on a minesweeper & landed on the Australian pier at ‘Mudros’. We managed to borrow two tents for our officers but we men had to bivouac. I spent a splendid night with a blanket to keep off the heavy dew. The minesweeper had a momento in the shape of a 9 inch shell which had pierced some ironwork. The Captain told me that he was taking off wounded from the French landing place & at one time it seemed that\n\nthe Turks were going to sweep them into the sea & he had orders to stand by to pick them up if it had come to pass. But they managed to hang on. He also spoke disparagingly of their fighting qualifications.\n","141":" We were apportioned to various duties such as gathering stones to mark a boundary for our camping ground carrying water & then was commenced preparing \"dug outs\" for sleeping quarters. We all had different designs. For myself I burrowed into a bank for a couple of feet for my kit & then erected a staging to carry a blanket to keep off the dew. We also had a swimming parade which made my fourth swim in Mudros Harbour up to date. The water is beautiful for swimming just now.\n","142":" Spent the day doing various fatigue duties & improving my ‘dug out’ & ending up with a swim. We had the sinking of the \"Triumph\" verified today, the Turks are certainly giving us something to think about. I have just been warned for Guard duty 2AM to 6AM. We reinforcements are having more than our share of such work. For some reason we have not yet been allotted to a section & any dirty work is shunted onto us. No more reinforcements for me. The very name makes me wild now. It is not as if the reinforcements were an inferior lot, they are a jolly sight better than half the old corps.\n","143":" On guard 2A.M. to 6A.M. 2P.M. – 6P.M. but duties a sinecure. We managed to get a loan of a marquee in case of bad weather. It is the latest pattern from England & is a fine\n\nstructure. Just had news that \"Majestic\" has been sunk this makes the third ship running & is a heavy blow to us. It will certainly necessitate a rearrangement of plans besides putting heart into the Turks but it cannot alter the ultimate result. Later. A doubt cast on the truth of the \"Majestic\" sinking. Supposed to be a transport but the usual rumours afloat. In the evening took a stroll through the village & witnessed a good deal of drinking. The place is full of French regiments, Zouaves, Senegalise, Algerians etc besides Hindoos, Soudanese, Australians, British, then Greeks who have enlisted in the French also New Zealanders. Add to these a sprinkling of nomads of other races & a good mixture is made. Wine is very cheap 1d & 2d & drinking shops have sprung up all over the place & at night the scene is a busy one. It is remarkable the number of languages some of the people speak, seven different ones is quite common.\n","144":" Received a new issue of clothing English pattern khaki drill tunic & trousers (which we afterwards cut down), splendid boots, 2 pairs socks shirt & towel. We now have more clothing than we can carry. The weather is still first rate & we had a very easy day swimming etc. A cricket march between the N.Z.M.C. & ourselves we won easily. Just missed being put on to dig graves today. I wonder what our next job will be. Sinking of Majestic conformed, makes 5 up to date, \"Ocean\" \"Irresistable\" \"Goliath\" \"Triumph\" and \"Majestic\". The presence of the enemies submarines\n\nhas caused somewhat of a reign of terror in a mild way. A reward of £500 is offered for information leading to one being destroyed and the Transports & majority of Battleships have to lie in the Harbours. Fresh troops are landed at night by fast channel boats used as minesweepers. The ordinary trawlers are not fast enough to work against the strong tide of the narrows.\n","145":" Did a short march about 8 miles to a village for exercise & saw some interesting scenes. We went into the village school & had a look at everything, all the youngsters gathering in one room for a photo. Then they sang their national anthem for our benefit while we gave a return with a concertina. We then endeavoured to photograph some girls & women washing at a well but as usual the young ones bolted at sight. We rarely see the young unmarried females. One of the funniest incidents I have witnessed was our march through the French camp. We were about 20 strong & were accompanied by a concertina. As we reached the camp our musician struck up the \"Marseillaise\" & the Frenchies ran out of their tents & lined the road clapping and cheering like mad. It was evidently the novelty as much as anything. We repeated the performance coming back. During the afternoon we received an issue of tobacco. One of the men of the \"Vengeance\" whom I met some days ago brought me a parcel of meat & bread. Nothing is too much trouble for them if they can help us in anyway.\n","146":" Spent about 3 hours bargaining with some Greeks for a boat. They asked various prices from £1 to 10\/- for the afternoon. We noticed one boat which we wanted but they would not tell us the owner, so we promptly took some oars from a boat nearby & started to row away when the owner announced himself quickly. We could not come to terms with him but refused to leave the boat till he arranged for another. We then arranged for one to cost 6\/- from 1PM to 6PM. On our arrival he was non est, so after more bargaining arranged with another for 5\/- from 2PM to 6PM & started off just as the first man appeared on the scene. Well we managed to get off after some swearing etc & arrived at the \"Mauretania\" & went aboard to look over her. A striking feature is the narrowness of the bows necessary perhaps for her speed. The tonnage is 45000 tons & she had on board 5000 fresh English troops. A corporal A.M.C. man took us in tow & showed us round & we caused some mild excitement, the majority never having seen Australians, expecting to see Blacks perhaps. We could hear comments on all sides as we walked along about the Australians, our chaps having made a reputation. The ship herself is wonderful. Electric Elevators etc & the fittings are splendid. From here we went off to H.M.S. Vengeance & asked permission to go aboard. A young fellow showed us round & everywhere we went they treated us splendidly shewing us the Guns, mechanism, shells, magazines etc. Then nothing would please them until we stayed to tea.\n\nThey cooked us eggs & feasted us splendidly. Many of them had been working with our chaps on shore taking off the wounded & they could not do enough for us. At night we had church service by Dean Talbot, rather a good sermon for him.\n","147":" Had a route march to a country village about 5 miles distant. On arrival we saw the usual scurrying females & pulled up at a café for a drink & were supplied with German Beer no less. Then three of us went round to the school & the Headmaster called them out to form up for me to take a photograph. Then I snapped them scrambling for backsheesh. The youngsters were highly pleased & when we first showed ourselves called out Australia & pointed to the map. Comparing them size for size they seem to be more forward then our youngsters. We carried on some kind of a conversation with the teacher by means of a mixture of Greek English & French & on him giving me his address promised to send him a photograph. About 9AM a German aeroplane flew across & dropped two bombs on the French camp killing & wounding a dozen. Luckily they missed our camp. We could first hear him & then see him soaring up at a great height. We also heard it rumoured that the \"Goeben\" was sunk.\n","148":" Reveille 5.30AM as we had orders to quit. We packed up camp & had to carry the major part of our equipment to the wharf as the mule cart’s\n\nwere late in arriving. We were deadbeat by 10AM the time the Pinnace was to call for us but as usual it arrived about 2 hours late. We arrived on the \"Ascania\" a Cunard 15000 liner about 1.30PM & were shortly after served up with a first class dinner of sausages much to our satisfaction but better was to follow. A start was made immediately to pull down the bunks to allow for taking on wounded. In the evening the crew treated us to a concert & we retired to rest convinced we had reached the last word in troopships. Where our ultimate destination is we know not but suspect some new landing to take place.\n","149":" \n\nReveille 5.30, Bread butter jam & coffee 5.45 absolute luxury. Then we worked to 8.15 pulling down fittings etc with the thought of a good breakfast before us which materialized in Porridge & sausages. I was then chosen for a boat party & returned to a dinner of Pea Soup & Roast Pork & again for tea Hariot mutton with the usual \"fill ups\" bread etc. We think it too good to last. Quite the best in our experience of this campaign. The ship has not had on Australians before & all seem bent on giving us a good time. While out in the morning we called on the \"Aragon\" & found a small mail the first for 2 months but had no luck myself. The ship contains Headquarters staff & ‘tis a busy scene all day. Steam launches go to & fro with dispatches & orders. Ships boats jostle with one another for a position\n\nat the gangway, a nerve racking game with a rough sea and officers of all ranks are going & coming looking for mails or orders or news of current events. We have just had news of the first death from wounds in our unit, a young fellow named Abbot & strange to say his number was 13. Each evening now, reinforcements are sent to the Dardanelles by means of fast channel boats. The Submarines have made it too risky to allow of Transports going unless specially guarded. They receive a good send off from their fellows. There is some little alarm amongst us this evening as rumours are about that we quit the ship. This morning a huge red cross was painted on the side & in the afternoon orders were received to paint it out again. We wonder what it fortells. As I was writing this on the deck in company with a few others we received one of the numerous pinpricks passed out to us occasionally. We number 36 all told, no other troops, & the Colonel came up & ordered the W.O. to send us below as the 3rd Class deck was good enough. Again, we were first allotted bunks now we are shifted to new quarters with no sleeping accomodation except the deck & one small room in which to jumble our kits, rather unnecessary severity when we are only a small medical Unit alone on a big ship. We fully expect our tucker to be reduced when the officers find out how the ship is feeding us.\n","150":"\n\nUp at 5.30 A.M. working at laying out beds etc. for wounded was picked for boat party in afternoon & managed to get a good Jack knife from \n\nthe supply ship. We are having another issue, trousers this time pure waste in my opinion as we do not need them.\n","151":" Began taking on wounded in earnest. Another big attack on the hill & our chaps suffered rather heavily. We have taken on practically all Englishmen very boyish some of them & taking them on the average, they are not as cheerful nor do they bear their wounds as well as the Australians. I started at 5.30 A.M. & then had to continue on for night duty till 7 A.M. the next morning, a shift of 25 ½ hours. When I knocked off I started reading till breakfast at 8.30 but fell asleep four times in 5 minutes & had to walk about. I turned in at 9 A.M. & slept splendidly till 4.30 P.M.\n","152":"\n\nSlept in & started on again at 7 P.M. till 7 A.M. Sunday Morning. On duty attending to wounded with about three operations.\n","153":"\n\nSlept in. Night & ;morning duty rather a busy time. Sailed for Alexandria about 9 A.M. much to our joy as we were a full ship of wounded practically all Englishmen.\n","154":"\n\nSlept in. Duty at night. Several operations, one arm taken off, others head cases , all very wonderful. I feel very safe now watching these gruesome sights but have a dread of it all & will be thankful when all is over. There have been a number of operations, arms & legs being taken off and\n\na large number of head cases, many have lived but a few have died from shock. Some few of the wounded are very young 17 & 18 & with their English faces look mere boys.\n","155":" \n\nArrived at Alexandria during the afternoon and I had a restless sleep through the winch working etc.\n","156":"\n\nUnloaded all our wounded with motors finishing about 7 P.M. We were given leave at night but not until we struggled for it & several had cleared off. Uptown there were hundreds of newly arrived Australians doing the sights & getting into trouble in the usual way. They were eager for news & many were the gory tales told to them by our chaps and others.\n","157":"\n\nWe were given leave during the afternoon much to our satisfaction. My first day was to get my watch repaired which cost me 12 P.T. after a great deal of bargaining then I bought two cushion covers & blouses to send home & several postcards & photos packing the whole up with some curios in the form of coins bullets etc. From here I went to see Lance who was camped at Sidi Bishr returning to the ship about 10.30 P.M.\n","158":"\n\nOn board all day & did the town in the evening. Spent about an hour looking through a curio shop wishing for the necessary to indulge in some.\n","159":"\n\nThe next few days were a succession of alarms disappointments & a display of mismanagement.\n","160":" evening about 8 P.M. orders came for the ship to proceed to England practically at once. This meant that we had to get off. Our Captain went ashore to try & find out where we where to go to but could get no orders but to quit the ship although she was eminently fitted for the use of wounded. We were told to pack up to leave at once but when everything was packed up we were told we could stop on the ship for the night. Then a lighter having been secured we set to & unloaded all our stores most of which we had taken on the previous day & consisted of our full equipment. Treating the matter as a joke we worked like niggers imitating the natives singing at their work etc just as though we were schoolboys. In the morning we left the ship much to our sorrow & the ships as we had worked splendidly together & we had a mutual admiration for each other. We were dumped on the wharf for some hours whilst our Captain endeavoured to get fresh orders. At last we were given permission to go aboard the \"Annabey\" a small boat then loading for the Dardanelles the authorities evidently being glad to get rid of us. By midday we were all aboard & dining once more on Bully Beef & Biscuits, a sad comedown. The ship was most unsuitable for troops & we were cursing our luck in striking her. It was then that a fire was discovered in one of the Bunkers & everybody had to quit the ship whilst all the cargo had to be taken off again. Here we were stranded once again. As a great boon we were allowed to sleep on the \n\nship that night although it was no good to me as I was on guard during the night.\n","161":"\n\nAt midday we were told to proceed to the \"Vaderland\" also known as the \"Southland\" a fine big ship which was preparing for the Dardanelles. Here we were installed in 3rd \n\nClass Cabins useful as we can keep our kits together easily. We moved out into the stream that night. A fine body of men aboard were the Surrey Yeomanry. Whilst we had a few hundred of returning wounded (recovered) both Australians and Englishmen.\n","162":"\n\nStill at anchor. I was put on fatigue duty & had to peel potatoes all day, the first time this duty having fallen to my lot, but a beautiful swim from the ships side brightened me up considerably in the evening. About 7 P.M. we left port with everyone talking about & chances of meeting a submarine. The authorities are very strict about our lifebelts & we are paraded with them ‘tis a wise step to prepare for all contingencies. Slept up on deck as I do now every night.\n","163":"\n\nFor a wonder had no fatigues to do so put the day in writing home a pleasant duty when I have something to say.\n","164":"\n\nNothing doing. Ship steering a zig zag course occasionally & taking a new route to Lemnos. Evidently Submarines about. At night we had a concert but the talent was rather poor. The British soldiers aboard seem to \n\nhave no initiative & it is left to the Australians to make any fun. At night sleeping on deck, someone went through my trousers & extracted 2\/-, luckily I had no more. First time this has occured to me so far although little things often disappear. \n","165":"\n\nArrived at Lemnos about 6 A.M. not quite so much shipping in evidence & I noticed very few troops about on what vessels were here.\n","166":" \n\nHad orders to quit ship & land at Lemnos. We packed up & just when sitting down to tea had to clear off and board the . After landing we carried up tents & gear & drew stores, finishing up about 9 oclock. Since our last sojourn here more Hospitals have been erected.\n","167":"\n\nReveille 5.30 A.M. owing to our camping ground being wanted for a Hospital we had to shift our gear once more. After breakfast started to erect tents being called away to form a boat party at eleven oclock to row to the store ship \"Umsinga\". Erecting tents all the afternoon & after tea carried wounded up to the Hospital finishing up about 7 P.M. No time for church parades. Managed to find time to have two swims however which make up for a lot. The sale of wine & beer is now prohibited owing to excesses by the troops mostly wounded. Saw Sir Ian Hamilton to day for the first time, I happened to be swimming from the wharf & was half dressed when he passed. I could not\n\nsalute but stood to attention. He smiled & said having a bathe to which I replyed Yes Sir! He struck me as being a very energetic man, grey moustache & wiry looking. His appearance inspires confidence.\n","168":"\n\nTo cap Sundays performance the W.O. put me on guard at night. He picks the Reinforcements out every time for any noxious duties. A Sergeant had the strength to say openly that it was a great shame. We spent the day working round the camp making a stone dividing wall & digging a refuse pit. While swimming from the wharf Sir Ian came along & remarked he would not mind doing the same. While writing this I can see a flock of sheep wading from an island to the mainland. The water reaches above their legs but they cross over night & morning without any urging whatever. After tea several of us went up to the village & noticed at once the difference owing to the embargo on wine beer etc. Nothing but a quiet orderly gathering instead of the usual riotous one.\n","169":"\n\nWith several others was drafted over as a fatigue party to No 1 stationary & spent the day raking up stones & cleaning camp. Half the number cleared off leaving the rest to do all the work.\n","170":"\n\nWas sent again for fatigue duty but entered a protest as a new party should be sent. We arranged a different system however \n\n& all the fellows working, things were much easier, we had two splendid dips during the day. There seems some nervousness in regard to disease & sickness increasing, the wounded being fewer than sick. Had a yarn today with a man who saw the Triumph sink, he said it was one of the saddest sights he had ever witnessed as well the finest the destroyers racing up at full speed to the rescue.\n","171":"\n\nWith six others was sent over to the No 2 Stationary Hospital for duty & was put on the 4 P.M. to 12 P.M. shift. There is very little work to do except give out the medicines as the patients are all able to move about & altogether is the easiest work I have yet struck. The flies are very troublesome & no efforts are taken to check their increase. They absolutely cover any edibles exposed & effectually prevent me from sleeping during the day. At daybreak they commence their torments. To me it appears likely that they will cause an epidemic sooner or later. No disinfectants are used at all although the camp is fairly clean otherwise.\n","172":"\n\nWent for a long swim about a mile out to a buoy & back. One bad case at night, delirium. Very sad but amusing at times. Evidently a well educated man & he thought that he was dead most of the time & was calling for his mother & sending messages to his people. And then he would speak of York Minister & dilate on its beauties. Then he\n\nwould speak of incidents at the front & he would cry most pitifully when the spoke of two young boys who were blown to pieces by a shell. He described how he found one leg only & buried it. He then sang the hymn \"O God our help in ages past\" & cried out \"God be with us, but I am afraid he is not with me\" & so on.\n","173":"\n\nHad another mile swim out to a ship felt much stronger in the water. At night had one bad case, a young fellow took a fit & was delirious for hours. His was a particularly sad case being the last of a family. He had three brothers drowned in a Submarine \n a fourth\nhis father went down in a Cruiser & his mother died from shock, truly enough to turn any mans mind. Had a look at the Greek church again & on giving 3d the priest lit two candles for us. I wonder what effect it had on my sins.\n","174":" \n\nOnce again our moving day. At 3.30 P.M. orders came for 50 of us to proceed at once to Cape Helles for duty. Here was our chance at last. Overjoyed And in my own case as well, serious thought, we packed up & proceeded by pinnace to the \"Arragon\" the headquarters ship. Here I looked up my friend Andrews who instantly prepared me a good tea & entertained me with some news. At 8 P.M. we embarked on the \"Hythe\" a sweeper & sailed shortly after for Cape Helles.\n\nOwing to the crowd on board proper sleep was out of the question. We landed at Cape Helles about 2.30 A.M. & after half an hours walk dropped our kits & turned in on mother earth. On our way we saw the remains of the \"Majestic\" the Hull sticking up about 6 ft like a huge well. Our landing place was a pier made of barges alongside the \"River Clyde\" the ship run ashore during the landing & we viewed with interest the signs of the bombardment, trenches etc. There were vast quantities of stores everywhere. I managed to get 4 hours sleep during that night, of a kind. \n","175":" \n\nHauled out from our slumbers about 6 A.M. & marched a few hundred yards to the No 11 Clearing Hospital Station. We were given till 11 A.M. to prepare our dugouts during which I worked like a nigger preparing my abode. Then we were told off to stretcher work, unloading motors, wagons etc & conveying wounded to the pier for embarkation on the Hospital ship, particularly hard work. About 9 P.M. orders came for 20 men to go & help the Ghurkas as they were deadbeat & volunteers were called for I chipped in although I don’t quite know why as I was dead beat & was preparing\n\nfor bed. During the day there was a heavy bombardment of a position 1500 yards from us where some heavy guns were situated. It was very picturesque & rather alarming as the shells went screaming over our heads. Damage done, 2 men laid out. The shells on landing sent up a fine shower of earth & when they landed in the water the column of water was very pretty. Added to that a shrapnel shell burst just to the rear of the Hospital giving us all rather a shock. It was strange to see the men shrink up & many of them duck into dugouts when the shell was heard approaching. ‘Tis a sensible thing to do however. The funniest episode of all happened during the afternoon. We had just \"fallen in\" & the shells had just stopped when four heavy blasts occurred on the cliff front just 10 yards in front of us & earth & small stones fell all around of us left. Some bolted at the first bang & so on till the fourth when not a man was standing in his original place & some were hundreds of yards away. It was nothing but the Egyptians blasting some rock to build a new pier. But to return. We embarked in two motor Ambulances, which took us 3 miles on our way, about 11 oclock\n\nthen we had to walk down a steep slope to the beach & ask our way of a dressing station there known as \"Gully beach\"\n","176":"\n\nOur way then led us along the beach about 3 miles till we reach our objective \"Gurkha Bluff\" on the way firing was constant & appeared just over our heads. Luckily ’twas moonlight & we picked our way amongst the boulders without mishaps & reported about 1.30 A.M. We were told we could turn in till 6 A.M. but they called us about 4 A.M. after getting two hours sleep. We then proceeded to work with stretchers walking along the beach, collecting wounded & bringing them back to the dressing station. Just before breakfast we did on big trip, four porters proceeding to an advanced gully with a guide. He took us up the gully the head of which was occupied by a \"Battery\" & shrapnel was pouring on to the exposed cliff face within a hundred yards of us but we were fairly safe until we advanced into the open again. Here they had several dead & several wounded & we took the four worst cases. We reached camp safely picking up on the way some fuses & shells etc. Shortly after nine we started off again, a \n\nparty of four leading, then myself and another about 50 yards away & had not proceeded more than half a mile when bang went a shrapnel shell bursting just behind the rear man of the four, one of our stretcher bearers, & severely wounded both legs above the knees, the bullets flashed past me on either side a special providence saving me from hurt. I rushed up & rendered first aid & whilst we were doing this, a second shell landed within five yards of us in the water fortunately not exploding rather a warm reception for a start. I & 3 others then carried him a distance of about 2 miles to the main Ghurka Hospital where the major spent 3 hours on the wounds. By a wonderful chance the main artery was not severed although fully exposed but several muscles were completely severed. With great care he stitched the muscles together making a splendid job of it & one which will evidently save him his leg. It appears that when we took our man away the remainders started a wee panic which discovered that we should return to Cape Helles. They appeared to become quite demoralized by the occurrence. Just as the doctor\n\nwas finishing the work our whole crowd trooped up & the Corporal asked that as there was not much more to do & and we were only lent for a short time could he allow us to return to our unit. I could have dropped with shame especially as an hour before we had arranged to get our kits over & make a longer stay. The permission was given & off they trooped one man especially being afraid to return for his kit. However nothing else could be done so we returned for our kits or what we had of them & I promptly accused some of them of spoiling the reputation our fellows had made. But apart from making a couple heartily ashamed of themselves it was wasted & we set off for our unit a distance of about six miles. Some of them even objected to marching home in the sun. So I went off with 3 others & left them to it. I could understand being nervous I was myself but they shewed an absolute lack of all the decencies. According to the tales recorded by some of them we witnessed some awful things but they were absolutely pure invention. I arrived about 4.15 P.M. had tea, wrote up my diary & then turned in for a good night’s rest.\n","177":" There was some excitement during the night however. A strong wind came up & blew the roof of our shelter off filling everything up with dust & dirt so that about 10.30 we had to carry our goods & chattels to a tent close by. In the morning we set about collecting timber etc. to repair our abode as there was not much to do at the Hospital. We started stretcher work again about 3.P.M. carrying wounded down to the beach. Whilst there a man was carried out by the undertow & although several of us endeavoured to locate the body we had no success. On arriving back at camp we found tea was practically over so set about to get ours. One thing the beach episode cost me was my watch. In the excitement I dived in without taking it off my wrist & the sea water finished it off. (But to return to teatime) one of my chums picked up our dishes & went to the cookhouse to get our tea when without warning a shell dropped within 10 ft. of him throwing him down & severely wounded the Cook. It was a wonderful escape & utterly unnerved him for a time. Then at intervals\t about six shells burst in the Hospital digging deep holes in the pathway. Luckily only one landed in the Marquies & wounded three men already wounded once. There\n\nwere a number of wounded Ghurkas awaiting removal & they all rushed for the cliffs edge we followed their examples & so awaited the end of the bombardment. The total casualties were 5 wounded & 1 killed. We then started work again after viewing the damage & had not been at it 10 minutes when another shell burst just to the rear of the tents & killed a horse. At once there was a stampede but this time work had to proceed & an officer who kept very cool checked the panic & soon we were all working again but very smartly with a nervous mein. At first my party of four stayed in our cubby house when the shelling started but when a shell landed within about 10 yards behind us & landed debris on our roof we sheltered under the cliff. The shelling appeared to be in return for what a French battleship gave them. During the afternoon she approached surrounded by destroyers & rapidly shelled some portion of the Turks position. It was wonderful to see the torpedo boats circling round & round watching for submarines. At night we turned in devoutly thankful for our escapes & dreading a renewal on the morrow.\n","178":" Called out at 6 A.M. & started sending off the wounded to Hospital ships. The\n\nweather very fine. Turks shelled us during the day one landing in the hospital but did no damage. I was working in the Pier & the nearest to me was close on 100 yds. The Marquee which had been struck by a shell suddenly burst into flame about midday & was totally destroyed with contents luckily no patients were inside. This tent has been singularly unlucky. Four times it was damaged by shellfire while all others escaped & now was finished for good. In the evening we carried up seven dead from the Pier a most unpleasant duty. At night orders came for us to return to Lemnos with the exception of 14 there was open rejoicing from many. They had had their fill of war already.\n","179":" Packed up & handed over our dugout to those remaining & very sorry I was to leave it as it was extremely comfortable. Whilst we were on the pier at 11 A.M. awaiting a pinnace to take us off the shelling recommenced forcing us to take cover. It was very severe & one shell landing in the water sent the spray all over me. The second last shell caught the naval Lieutenant in charge of the pier & took off part of his foot & also wounded his companion. It was only a few minutes previously he had joked with us on the pier. We went on board the \"Hythe\" to set off for Lemnos about 3.30 P.M.\n\narriving about 8.30 P.M. Strange to say I was seasick on the voyage, perhaps because my inside was wrong. No definite orders for us on our arrival so we turned in but 10 of us were hauled out about 10.30 P.M., had to pack up & leave for another ship. It had started to rain & we first had to go to the pier to get medical supplies & then to the S.S. Fauvette. Damp & trying to be cheerful we arrived at 1 A.M. & then turned in for the night. We had a large number of Scotties aboard & sailed for the Dardanelles arriving 6 A.M.\n\nSaturday morning","180":" Being new to the place the Scotties were glad to get us to point out the different places & I think we all more or less posed as old experienced soldiers, very blasé. They landed by means of trawlers after tea & looked a fine body of men as they went off to do or die. Later on in the evening we took on 20 stretcher cases. The turks shelled the shore a little but nothing serious.\n","181":" Nothing exciting during the morning barring a little shelling of the shore but we witnessed a tragedy later. At midday a French Battleship came up with destroyers & commenced bombarding the Asiatic shore the Turks replying & landing a few around our ship & amongst the ordnance stores on shore. A heavy explosion also took place in\n\n * \"The Carthage\"\n\nthe neighbourhood of the French lines but we could not tell what it was. At 2 o’clock whilst sitting down to dinner we felt & heard an explosion & passed a joke concerning it, but on looking out of the Port Hole I saw four Destroyers steaming rapidly away from the Battleship & on looking in this direction I was amazed to see a large French Transport * heeling over at the stern. She had been torpedoed & was rapidly sinking. It was an extraordinary sight. The stern disappeared first, the bows pointing up into the air straight up & then gradually disappeared leaving nothing but a swirl of water with debris & a few bodies. Trawlers etc hurried to the rescue & Destroyers began to circle round looking for the submarine. Our ship, an armed Patrol boat also took up the search & our Gun & crew sighted something near where the French Battleship had been & instantly fired several rounds at it. I was standing close by & the noise was deafening although only a 12 pounder. There was quite a panic on board, nearly everyone thinking we had been hit & they rushed up on deck tying on lifebelts etc. One Ghurka died shortly after. I fancy the fright helped him along. We steamed over where she sank. A very serious moment\n\nnot knowing if we were to be the next. Nothing happened however & we returned to our anchorage took on more wounded & sailed for Mudros arriving about 9 P.M. We landed the worst cases that night onto the ‘Devanha’ a Hospital Ship.\n","182":" Landed the remainder of our wounded. Asked permission of our Doctor to go aboard the Arrogan to look for mail & was fortunate enough to get some the first for 3 weeks. Met my friend there as usual & he was giving me dinner when I was called away. Spent the remainder of the day reading the papers which I received.\n","183":" Pinnace called for us & we landed & were sent onto No 1 A.S.H. for duty did nothing first afternoon. Met several old friends & some of the chaps I was in camp with who were returning to Alexandria so gave them some letters to post home.\n","184":" Was put on Cooks fatigue which meant washing up dishes & being a general rouseabout for them. \"Tis a job many are eager for as they often get daintees in the eating line. A friend on passing, seeing me thus engaged remarked – how the mighty have fallen.\n","185":" Having no helpers I objected to carrying on as before so two more men were put on to assist. It was very trying in the hot sun all day\n\nbut I got wise & cleared off for a spell occasionally & took the whole afternoon off. Splendid lot of Reinforcements now coming forward, 24,000 in one batch & all well trained & fit having been at it for 11 months. On speaking to some however it looked as if they had been overworked & their pay in comparison to ours makes them dissatisfied. One growler in particular who said he would never be caught again rather angered me & I told him that he was only fighting for his own & that if he refused to go next time he would be made to go & probably get less pay as well. One wants to be in good health here to enjoy life what with an abundance of flies, fleas & lice, shortage of water & uncongenial tasks, one is liable to become irritable.\n","186":" Hot windy & dusty but feeling well can smile at all discomforts. What odds if the tent blows down, the half of Mudros blows in the food, the Jam cannot be seen for flies so long as I have 3 meals per day, a bed to sleep on (Mother Earth) & the bay to swim in. Thousands of new troops are arriving. They land here from the Transports & are then shipped to the Dardanelles per Torpedo Destroyers or mine sweepers. Transports no longer go right up, the risk is too great from Submarines. There is something big going on with persistant rumours that many of us\n\nare going to be withdrawn shortly & sent to England with the object of refitting & going to France. I hope so but would like to see this affair concluded first. Perhaps it means that the end is in sight. I would like to think so but it seems to me that there is a lot to do yet. While swimming near the wharf I had my name taken by the Military Police. My offence was approching too close to the Pier. I expect that I will hear more later.\n","187":" Windy & dusty once more. Orders out making the village & ships in harbour out of bounds. Some of the hoodlums go out & buy spirits etc & come home drunk considering themselves dead smart. There was also a mild kind of riot in the village. ‘Tis the same old tale of a few spoiling things for all. The \"Aquitania\" came in this morning loaded with troops. She makes all others, Battleships included, appear toys.\n","188":" Warm & dusty. Went to church service at night & listened to a first class address. Singing was poor, there was no-one to give a lead. Heard a rumour that ‘Metz’ was taken by French.\n","189":" Still hot & dusty. A mail arrived addressed to C\/o Capt Stacey & was taken in charge by our Sergeant who refused point blank to open it until our officers returned. The crowd acquiesced but I went & interviewed the Capt with the result he ordered the bag to be opened & sorted immediately. Joy everywhere, it proved\n\nto contain the majority of our back letters. I topped the poll receiving 10 letters & 3 Papers. I felt as happy as a king & have done little else but read them ever since. I can now let my ma know her letters have arrived which will please her. New troops relieving a lot of the Britishers from Cape Helles. They all say our chaps refuse to shift until the \"hill\" is taken. Casualities in our Corps up to date is 19 wounded 2 killed one died.\n","190":" &","191":" Hot & Dusty weather. French flags much in evidence today being Republic day or some such thing. The most forlorn picture I have seen for some time is that of wounded & sick arriving for this Hospital. They land on the pier & then straggle up the hill with their soiled clothing etc looking in many cases the picture of misery.\n","192":" One of our hottest days & I put in a good days work, cleaning up the Cook House, whitewashing the stone Fence etc. Saw in the \"Age\" May 25th where young C. Jones of Leichhardt died. We left him at Suez on our way over. I felt rather upset as he was a jolly good kid & was in the same tent as myself in Sydney.\n","193":" Received a good mail consisting of 9 letters & some papers. This is something like & makes one much more contented. Spent the afternoon answering Ma’s letters. At night we had\n\na first rate lantern lecture of Captain Scott’s expedition by a Fleet Surgeon who was there. His recital of hardships simply given makes our present trip a picnic by comparison.\n","194":" Hot as usual. Had a narrow escape from a bad burn at the Cookhouse today but all ended without damage. Received another good mail today, 9 letters. I wonder how long it will last. The \"Maureatania\" has arrived full of troops, just fancy two of our greatest liners being here together in this obscure but nevertheless splendid harbour. Still having my daily swims.\n","195":" Having received no word concerning my breach of regulations a few days ago expect it has been forgiven. (My name was taken for swimming near the Pier). At the Cookhouse I am known as the Pay-master, this being a sling off because I don’t act the servant to the Cooks as they would like & during the afternoon I clear off to my tent for a spell or write letters etc, the Sergeant thinks I should stand by & stoke the fires while he does the lying down. Not arf, but he takes it in good humour. Church service tonight rather good, will try to go to Communion next Sunday if I am here.\n","196":"","197":" &","198":" Nothing of note, hot & dusty days. Concert held at night but did not attend as busy reading the \"times\". Yesterday had orders to be paraded to the\n\ncolonel for refusing to work for cooks all the afternoon but have heard nothing further.\n\nMy practice is to go off after dinner till dry rations call 4 p.m. for a spell & they wanted me to stand by all day while they had a sleep as nothing is done during the afternoon but no fear. I stand on my dig. They call me the Pay Officer (sarcasm) but we are good friends through it all. Received another mail but it consisted of one paper only. I sold my camera & received 10\/- first instalment. The expense of films and the trouble of it has proved too much for me so now I will go : Will Drummond haves which will enable him to take more snaps with benefit to both. Have just sent off 1\/9 to London for another diary as am reaching the end of this.\n","199":" Had some music today, a band performing during the afternoon, being much appreciated & a concert at night. Very persistent rumours about Bulgaria coming in but I take no notice till official.\n","200":" Although had good intentions of going to Communion I did not wake in time. During afternoon word came that Surgeon General Baxter was coming to inspect the hospital & everyone was called out to tidy up the lines. Even the Colonel was seen to pick up some\n\npieces of paper. Church at night, rather a good address on the filthy language\n","201":" Was given a new job, that of dispensing, somewhat of a rise from washing dixies & much more congenial\n","202":" Strong rumours concerning future movement of this hospital floating about. So if true may have a shift at any moment. The remainder of that division are now on the island another reason to expect developments.2 tins of milk yesterday to send up to Will. D but have not yet been able to buy any cocoa etc.\n","203":" Inoculated for Cholera. Staff dispense took ill leaving me to carry on. The officers are congratulating themselves on me being available & have expressed their satisfaction to me.\n","204":" Extremely busy day but managed to keep the work down. Rumours about that we are to be recalled & several are trying to get transfers in order to be left.\n","205":" The remainder of our unit now arrived & have orders to move at any moment. The major of this hospital said he would keep me if he had to use an armed guard.\n","206":" Major informed me this morning that he had arranged with my Captain, Capt Aspinall, for me to remain, so I saw Capt Aspinall in order to find out if possible for how long it would be & if they wished me to\n\ntransfer he would prevent it. His reply was that if they offered me stripes he would not prevent it. I am torn between doubts as to the advisability of transferring. I know Mother would be glad & my screw would be doubled so I expect That I will take it on if available.\n","207":" Still carrying on by myself.\n","208":" Hearing that some of our chaps were going to Anzac I strolled about & managed to get milk, coffee, cocoa, oatmeal etc to send to Will. D., wrote a letter & all & then the blighters refused to take it up with them, such are pals & comrades.\n","209":" Some big movement in the wind. The No 2 A.S.M. have orders to evacuate their tents but to leave them for us to take up. They are going to the other side of the Harbour with the British tents to take in wounded. Our staff is already understrength & the new arrangement means we have to double our number of sick. Take my own side. Two dispensers did the work for about 300 sick & now both being sick I am doing the work for 800 patients and more are expected up to 1000. The first day we took over I worked from 6.45 A.M. to 11 P.M. dispensing all the time feeling stock bottles etc.\n\nA man had all his time taken up washing bottles for me & I filled them as quick as he could wash them The officers are\n\nrather upset about the rush of work. We actually should have 70 more orderlies & 8 more medical men. There appear to be plenty ambulance men on the island but they are all under orders to move off at once & are held in readiness to deal with the wounded at the new landing by taking them off in ships.\n","210":" Still going strong but have managed to complete all scripts etc. to time, my fear now is to get drugs enough & quick enough as I have used up a large quantity. Rumours have arrived concerning the new landing. Tis said it has been carried out without opposition. The guns which shelled w beach I believe are now controlled by moniters. They have 2 – 14 inch guns & are trained to a foot on Chanak. When they start we reply which causes them to shut up shop. my stay there would have been more comfortable if the moniter had been available before\n","211":" Kept pegging along briskly. Had an invitation to visit the \"Swiftsure\" but could not get away.\n","212":" Extremely busy day, could not have my usual dip. Patients increased to over 1000 and drugs for treatment of diarrhea running out.\n","213":" Arranged to go out in Colonels motor boat to visit the \"Swiftsure\" Arrived about 6 P.M. but unfortunately she was under orders to sail at 7.30 so only had a short time aboard. In that time, however, we were conducted down to our officer friend’s cabin treated to drinks were given cigarettes etc, regaled\n\nwith the particulars of the sinking of the Turkish battleship & altogether had a good time. A slap up dinner had been ordered for us but no matter. She was going to do some good work. From there we went to the \", Mimatonka\" now a store ship where I purchased biscuits etc. then returned to camp for a snack. We then left again to go aboard the \"Aquitania\", a ship worth seeing. There the wireless operators received us & once again we were treated as kings, meeting at the same time three of the officers from the \"Fauvette\" , a boat we spent some time on. We visited the barber & had a shampoo & arrived back at camp 12.30. feeling the better for the outing. The night dews upset engine somewhat & it took quite half an hour for it to start up but when she did start it was not long begore we were home. The Aquitania had on board about 7000 troops. She is absolutely immense & one cannot actually realise her true size.\n","214":" Still going strong. Orders came for our unit to join up with others at Gaba Tefe & I was one who had to be left behind. It was impossible for me to go as I was the only dispenser available. It was very disappointing however when the chance came for me to join Will & Co to be in at what we think will be the\n\nfinish & then not be able to go. But I believe in providence now & if my work keeps me here, here I stop & if not well Gaba tefe. I am quite content almost to do anything with prefences of course for some things. This is one way the war has affected me not being half so fussy & wanting my own way. I felt rather lonely saying goodbye to the boys & hope they all do well. I sent up biscuits & milk & chocolate to Will also a letter. Wounded have been coming in heavily. It seems that our new move is going to be a costly one so hope that the result will be good.\n","215":" &","216":" . Kept going same work. Awful rumours about but very little proper news. Received a mail of 6 letters very welcome\n","217":" By myself once more My assistant having a bad leg but things went O.K.\n","218":" Very slack & easy day. Witnessed an operation for Empyema. Pints of matter coming away. Portion of the rib had to be removed to obtain free entry. The trouble was brought on by pleurisy. Spent some time writing up a good mail.\n","219":" Moderate day. At night spent some time watching operation assisting at times.\n","220":"","221":" 17th","222":" &","223":" several days missed through various reasons. Dispensary work slackened off a little owing to very sick being admitted latest cases coming down\n\nBeing wounded. These last cases show a lack of proper attention owing to big influx of wounded or some such such cause. We had four amputations one night all of which I attended & gave a hand occasionally. One was prettily finished leg taken off at knee. The knee cap was cut in half & left to grow on end of stump this allowing the loose flesh on knee to be brought round the stump giving it a finish not obtainable in any other way. During this operation I was plentifully splashed from the artery. One evening I went off to the French camp for a night out, but it only resulted in a concert all in French. The artists were first rate however & especially one who sang Carmen was splendid. One general was present & several officers & the men were allowed to \"take Off\" their officers by means of songs & a kind of cinematograph which reflected figures a few inches in size.\n","224":" &","225":" Steady going in Dispensary allowing me to witness various operations. News of war rather discouraging Russia being driven back, Warsaw fallen two transports sunk but against that rumours of engagement in North sea resulting in various Germans being sent to the bottom.Let ‘em all come. Our turn will come\n","226":" Shifted\n\ndispensary into a more central position Had the marque cleaned out & sprayed with cresol in the morning & then with a gang of 6 men shifted into the new quarters It was solid work with noone but myself to arrange everything. Luckily business was slack so that I was not greatly troubled concerning the dispensing.\n","227":" Strong wind blowing with clouds of dust, most unpleasant. Strengthened the guys & dug a trench in case of bad weather. Had issued today insect powder, tooth brush & tooth powder. Red Cross stores coming to hand now are very welcome although Tis a job to get them, just like drawing blood out of a stone to get them issued.\n","228":" Heavy wind blowing with clouds of dust, the harbour being almost obscured. Reports of new landing very satisfactory the position being explained by means of military map by a Captain to me today. I have also been fortunate enough to meet two australian soldiers who had a grasp of the situation & could speak of it fairly without exaggeration, a very rare thing. From them I received much valuable information concerning operations.\n","229":" slight rain during the day. A band from H.M.S. Cornwallis came ashore today\n\n& was much appreciated fellows locking from all sides. Also had my first drink of Russian Vodka from the russian cruiser in port. Much like brandy but a more fruity flavour. This particular cruiser the \"Askold\" is known as the packet of Woodbines having five funnels.\n","230":" Busy day & felt off colour. In fact felt worse than I have done for months past but it passed off by night time. Rain threatening all day & started in earnest about 8 o’clock at night, I then had to get out in the rain to loosen the Guy Ropes. Have heard Lord Dudley our late Governor has arrived to take up position of Camp Commandant. Having great trouble to obtain drugs, the depot treating us very scurvily & our major is very loth to growl but I kept at him & I fancy he will shortly complain.\n","231":" Very busy day. Went round the various wards to examine the medicines & condemned a lot of old stuff etc. added to this 200 new cases in gave extra work. A piano having been presented to this unit, a concert is held practically every night but I do not get a chance to attend as my writing would have to go if I did & I prefer to write home.\n","232":"","233":" 30th","234":"\n\nLast few days very busy. Weather turning cooler a welcome change. Received help yesterday a young new Zealander, a dispenser, turning up much to my gratification. Concerts 3 times a week are now the order, a piano having arrived from Australia. Am now by myself the dentist being in Hospital with the usual fever, temperature etc. The Doctors are of the opinion that only inoculation saves us from serious complications with these attacks. One night we had a heavy storm of rain but there was practically no damage done bar a few broken guys. Camp now better managed & worked, we having 120 extra men Infantry, light duty men, who have cleaned up & formed pathways etc. Latrine accommodated has also been much improved but very late in the day, we having been here now 5 months almost. Managed to get a swim yesterday & came out tired plainly showing the effect of no swim for a fortnight.\n","235":" Still going steadily along slightly better time owing to my new assistant.\n","236":" Took the day off, obtained a pass, & with a sergeant friend went by the ferry to Turks Head to pay a visit to the various hospitals there. No. 3. general No. 2. Stationary & 2 Canadian hospitals.\n\nAlmost 80 nurses are there & some are very decent it being a refreshing sight to see a decent woman once more. I had dinner at the sergeants mess at No.2. was treated to drinks at the Canadian, visited the various dispensaries none of which do as much as our own & all have a bigger staff. That of No. 3 has a Lieutenant Dispenser as well as various sergeants\n","237":" Last few days much as before. One evening I accepted an invitation to have a ride inland a bit & was well rewarded by doing so. I first had tea with my friend, a warrant officer of the Royal Engineers then round came the horses & we set off. The country we passed was very interesting. Cotton was growing to quite a large extent as was also linseed, then grapes & melon of all kinds were everywhere & plenty of soldiers were making themselves quite at home amongst them. We passed a deserted Turkish village & came on a herd of oxen specially reared for haulage & a fine lot they were, numbering some hundreds & all fine beasts. Next the old fellow guided me to a small river pointing out various turtles showing their heads till we came to some ruins dating back to the Knights\n\nof St John. The courtyard was plainly visible surrounded by trees of great age. Yesterday with a friend I did my long expected expedition to Castro the Capital of this island. We crossed over by the early morning ferry calling at No 3 & No 2 Hospitals on our way then walked about 2 miles to a village Portiana where we hired two donkeys for 8\/- to take us through the hills to our destination about 8 miles in all. It seemed a sin for the Donks to carry us they were so small but well fitted for the track it being very irregular & rough However we arrived at Castro about 1.30 P.M. without mishap passing several splendid springs on the way but otherwise very monotonous apart from its ruggedness. Leaving our boy to mind the Donkeys we found a restaurant & happened to sit down alongside a Greek & negro who both spoke splendid English. From then on we were made. Through the Greeks help we ordered a good dinner. of fried fish & chops. China tea etc. Then I managed to collect several foreign coins with his help & also a number of Greek stamps of which he had quite a number. Before leaving we stood him a bottle of wine which so warmed his heart to us that he constituted himself our guide for the\n\nremainder of the day. Our first place of call of the Greek Church rather fine in a way but the carving was rather crude & the gilding etc last done 30 years ago was looking very tawdry. Various hanging silver lamps were of good workmanship as also the chandeliers. Various incidents of the bible were portrayed on the walls & altar screen all giving one the impression of the ancient worship of the figures & pictures. The man in charge received Franc 1 in backshish for his trouble from me. We next did our shopping my purchases consisting of one pair of Greek shoes to send home for Gwen & a Turkish rug of rather fine work for which I paid 15\/- after some bargaining. From here we proceeded to the Ancient Turkish Fort about 600 year old & were shewn over it by theLieutenant in Charge who afterwards returned with us to the village where we exchanged cards & cracked various bottles of very fine beer from Salonika. It was now getting late but on looking for our donkeys we were amazed to find them gone, the boy evidently being afraid of doing the pass after dark. There was nothing for it but to set off rapidly to try to do the worst before\n\ndarkness set in so buying a loaf for our tea & bidding adieu to our guide we set off at a great pace for home. Luckily we found the track before dark & managed to come through without accident but I never wish for the experience again. We were forced to hurry over a track in the dark which during daylight required care so it was no wonder we stumbled fell slipped etc but happily it all ended safely. Our only trouble was when we reached the village & a tommy misdirected us to the wrong village & we were lost for about half an hour. We eventually reached our destination No 3 General at 10.30 P.M. where after having supper friends gave us two blankets each & we spent the night there. The next morning we boarded the ferry once more reaching our camp at 10.00 A.M. feeling tired & sore after our exertion. The damages I sustained were a twisted knee & saw elbow through falling down a hole just off the pass but a couple of days will see all correct again.\n","238":" Nothing of note last five days bar two items of news. First that this Hospital is to proceed to Anzac & that my unit with the","239":" Division had arrived on\n\nthe island for a spell. What is to become of me I do not know. Using Asquith’s phrase I will say \"Wait & see.\\\". Heavy rain last night came down in torrents & in my comfortable bunk I thought of those not so situated.\n","240":" Up early for of Church but could not find it when I did get up. Friday, took a friend to visit the W.O. of the Engineers Camp, had tea with him & then being given two horses had a great ride into the various camps around. In one place between two Hospitals they had a big stack of Ammunition, not quite a fair go to the enemy or the patients. I was great having a real good gallop along the flats although the military saddle is rather strange at first. Yesterday we borrowed a boat from the Piermaster & rowed to the \"Swiftsure\" & had tea in the W.O.’s mess. They are real good fellows & always treat us well. They had just returned from \"Suvla Bay\" where they had been continuously under fire for 5 week sustaining 7 killed & a few wounded. One shell penetrated 5 thicknesses of bulkheads just penetrated into the\n\nW.O.’s mess & then fell back into the pantry spinning round on the floor. I could not stop long as they were leaving the same night. They speak now of the Turks shelling as \"straffing\" & they say they were well strafed one incident of the loss of a sweeper she was unloading ammunition from a transport when owing to Turks getting the range the ship had to move forward. The sweeper remained & swung in a little & the propellor of the transport ripped her side out causing her to sink & eventually to partially blow up owing to having on board a special mine. This mine explodes when it reaches a depth of 30 feet as well as by contact & can be dropped on any object below such as a submarine. Last Wednesday afternoon I visited my unit on the other side of island & met old faces again not seen for 5 months. Best of all I received a mail out of 250 men without reinforcements our strength is now 88 including reinforcements\n\nThe rest being (3 killed) wounded or sick & spread over the whole\n\nHospital system Egypt Malta & England. The men are being fed well to buck them up, getting eggs rice etc also a large bottle of Stout between two men one day & beer the next. Something like reasonable treatment as it prevents men buying illicit grog etc. We had commenced packing to move to Anzac when we received orders to cease & prepare for 500 patients which we duly received last night. For how long our move will be delayed I do not know.\n","241":" &","242":" Had a swim Monday afternoon & found the water cooler than usual winter beginning to creep on. Today we borrowed a boat from Pier master at 4 P.M. & had a sail around the harbour, little things like this help to keep one fit.\n","243":" and","244":" Last 12 days just even going. Having received some printing paper from Egypt managed to get time to print some photoes for which purpose I borrowed films from other fellows & some of the officers & picked out the best. I managed to do over 100 & all being picked formed a very fair collection The weather taking a warm turn I managed to get a couple of swims\n\nin & enjoyed it well. I also managed to send some things home, photos etc & received a parcel of cigarettes from Morris, all crumpled up however by their travels. Rumours still current about our moving to Anzac yet we are still taking patients & have practically reached our former number. This morning I went to Communion, the second time on this island. Last Sunday it was a splendid service the new Chaplain being a first ranker. Concerts are still held during the week But I never go through lack of interest & being on night duty or rather standing by in the Dispensary for night calls. Yesterday I designed a Christmas Card & sent it home to be fixed up for me through Laughland & Mackay. I hope it comes in time as it will be a curiosity for them rather unique.\n","245":" Nothing doing during day. About 5 P.M. we took out the surfing boat & had a run round getting back about 9 P.M. after having an exciting sail back in the dark. We were almost run down by a sweeper whose Captain advised us to keep our sailing confined to the daylight. \n","246":"\n I had leave all day so took our dinner &\n\nsailed all round the harbour examining different ships etc. We tried to board the \"Olympic\" but had no luck. So decided to run down to the \"Franconia\". There an Australian Captain just returned from England spotted us & managed to get an order form the Purser giving us permission to get stores from the Canteen. He yarned to us for about an hour saying it was like home again meeting Australians after being with the more formal Englishmen so long He stated that Australians are well treated & respected in England our name being made for all time. Yarning with another Officer later who told us it was a positive relief to speak with men as man to man without Sir being given him after each word as the English soldier does.. It certainly is monotonous is monotonous & irritating to our ears to hear so much servility. Amongst the latest arrivals were a fair number of old servicemen but the younger Lieutenants were more boys without sign of a whisker & speaking to some later on it was most noticeably how ignorant they were of the place & different \n\nincidents quite common knowledge through publication in the papers. One even had not heard of Anzac the landing of the Australians although this name was very common in England being on the official maps. Coming back we had to scull home the rudder collapsing but arrived home safely after having had a splendid day.\n","247":" Had a busy day being by myself & new patients coming in.\n","248":" Patients increased once more to 1000 so had plenty of work being by myself had a very heavy day.\n","249":" Went out in the afternoon to the \"Franconia\". Had refreshments with the printer, a good long yarn with some Scottish troops my photo taken, bought some stores & incidently had a real good time.\n","250":" received some more mail much to my joy. Had a heavy storm at night. Rain & a gale of wind but the Dispensary & most of the tents stood it well\n","251":" Had a busy day being by myself most of the time. Mr Breet & another Lieutenant of the Swiftsure came ashore late in the afternoon & we rowed them back after tea just a nice\n\nbit of exercise. They told me that two torpedoes were fired at them on the last trip, having a very narrow escape.\n","252":" Four of us went aboard the Swiftsure for tea and dinner & had a splendid time & a fine old yarn with the warrant officers. We left there with 200 odd pkts of cigarettes but owing to a dispute with one of the party who had had too much spirit as to who owned the stuff he was pitched into the water & many of the cigarettes with him. He afterwards reported us for robbing him but no notice was taken of him & he was glad to let the matter slide in the morning. We gained a little information & news concerning movements but mostly enjoyed the social side & two good meals off real china again somewhat of a change from tin plates etc.\n","253":" Nothing doing much bar work. Had a go in with my assistant & refused him leave during the afternoon as he was slacking. Have a slight cold in the head my first touch for months\n","254":" Nothing doing bar rumours of a ship with a large mail being sunk. The mention of the mail makes it a personal matter the loss of the ship being passed over\n\nas quite ordinary but our mil – never! My assistant received the sack today being put onto nursing duties & the dentist was told not to do any more work & to report on what work he had in hand. The heads have evidently got wise to his goings on & intend to check them. Received a parcel today, it having taken just 2 months to reach me. Rumours today state we are not going to Anzac now but remain where we are for the time being.\n","255":" &","256":" Weather cooler. Cold in the head causing me some annoyance but not much. This afternoon went for a long walk as I felt seedy. First I went to the cemetery which is rapidly growing. Our section is now being cared for better & equals the French in neatness but owing to great carelessness the names of the early graves are not known & all that can be put on the crosses is R.I.P. A strong fence has been put around the whole & in this little patch are buried men of all colors & creeds from all parts of the world drawn here for a common purpose. I next had a look at the Convalescent Camp & passed on into the hills. Here I sat & watched a Greek digging & on\n\ngiving him a cigarette he fished out a melon somewhat like a sweet cucumber & halved it with me. Tis extraordinary how we converse with these people. Neither knows the other’s language yet with a word or two of Arabic English & French & plenty of shrugs & shaking of the head we generally make each other understand. I collected various seeds, peas, bean melon etc. to send home. I then searched a high hill from which I could gaze down on our camp. It appeared to be a big plain & reminded me of the view from Bulli Pass. A big plain stretching out in front & the sea in the distance. There we had the harbour & hills beyond that. The village of mudros appeared to be the centre & round it were grouped Tents, marquees, sheds etc. of all descriptions with white roads like ribbons winding in between. The plain was Bhaki Colem the village a dull brown the tents white & the blue sea as a background all made a good picture. Here & there are black patches where horses are tethered. I arrived back in the camp just in time for Cookhouse having spent a good afternoon in\n\nthe best of company – myself.\n","257":" afternoon I went aboard the \"Swiftsure’ for dinner & had a good time, we saw the latest telegrams etc &had a good yarn about current events . I put my Sunday best on for the outing & walking down to the pier with my overcoat over my shoulder & camera in the other had must have looked swanky as I received two salutes. The sail on the harbour was grand. In the morning I went to communion. Monday morning I woke to hear the 5 minutes call going so sprang up in order to be up on time for parade 6.45. Five minutes proved sufficient as I was in time for the fall in with eye & nose running & shivering with cold. Judge of my disgust when later I found out that it was 6 oclock parade & I need not have attended at all. The Aquitania has arrived & we are now sending off patients to her, we have also received orders once more to pack up and evacuate Hospital. heard a rumour that an ultimatum has been sent to Greece to declare herself one way or the other, if true nothing could be better. Action like this puts new heart into a man, it shows that the heads are alive to matters and\n\nare not going to be imposed upon.\n","258":" More cases sent away & several wards are already empty & cases of ward medicines are being brought in for me to deal with. It appears to be a sure thing this time our removal. General Munro inspected the Hospital but did not stay long. He is the man who takes General Hamilton’s place. It seems sad to think that this man who has done his best is thus transferred but ‘tis no time for sentiment. His address of farewell is as follows – \n\nGeneral Headquarters\n\nMid. Enfed Force\n","259":"\n\nOn handing over the command of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to general Sir C.C. Munro, the Commander- in - Chief wishes to say a few farewell words to the Allied troops with many of whom he has now for so long been associated. First, he would like them to know his deep sense of the honour it has been to command so fine an army in one of the most arduous & difficult campaigns which has ever been undertaken; secondly he must express to them his admiration of the noble response which they have invariably \n\ngiven to the calls he has made upon them . No risk has been too desperate; no sacrifice too great. Sir Ian Hamilton thanks all ranks, from generals to private soldiers, for the wonderful way they have seconded his efforts to lead them towards that decisive victory , which, under their new chief, he has the most implicit confidence they will achieve.\n\nHad a kick at a football tonight just the thing to keep the spirits up. \n","260":" In the midst of packing up. All patients gone. Some to England, to Egypt & to the neighbouring Hospitals. And now the marquees are being rapidly pulled down. The camp is upside down. Electric light has been removed & we have to fall back on candles. We have packed up all the Dispensary & it now remains that only the Quartermaster’s store has to finish. I was also told that I would rejoin my unit & not go to Anzac with this Hospital an order having come through that no attached men were to be taken . Luckily I had not reckoned on going so was not disappointed . It only means that I will go up with the","261":" Field Amb instead, so expect \n\nto rejoin them any day as they are resting on the other side of the island. I had prepared a store of things, biscuits cocoa etc with a friend but will not now be able to take them as we have no means of carrying extras in the ambulance. I will take however a supply of cigarettes matches tobacco etc also notepaper & anything else of a small nature.\n","262":" I attended church at night & heard a splendid sermon, one of the best. Monday the chief event was a football match between A & B section. I was picked to play with the B section although I had some doubt about my playing as I did not know the Australian Rules. However I played & startled myself & I fancy most of my friends. I seemed to pick up the game very quickly & was congratulated for playing one of the best games there. My best piece of work was I managed to get the ball near centre & kicked it. It was returned but I had followed up & once more gained possession of it & running a few yards kicked a ripping field goal. I am not much of a drop kick at ordinary times but this time all seemed to go \n\nwell & the ball soared high up between the goal posts beautifully . Tuesday was a soccer match between our crowd & the","263":" Station result, one all. At night we held a concert and the talent was splendid, quite as good if not better than in civil life. Our officers were present & had invited the leading French officers & the English officers totalling quite 40, quite a distinguished company. This day the staff Dispenser took sick which brought my case forcibly before the O.C. with the result that today he sent me across to my unit to try & get a transfer or else permission to stay on. The trip was very rough but I had a splendid day seeing old friends again.\n","264":" Came back with a note from my O.C. & handed it to the Major, It contained a refusal to his request, rather rough on the Major, so I return to my unit tomorrow after being away from them for six long months. I spent today packing up & writing letters & preparing to clear out \n","265":" - after some delay managed to get a loan of one of the cars to take me to the pier with my gear. I had collected some good things for the cold weather also some \n\ncigarettes & such like delicacies, writing paper, envelopes matches also 4 blankets all of which made too big a load to carry far so the use of the car was handy. We crossed the harbour by the official boat & managed to get a lift by a G.S. waggon to the camp. It was rather a strange return as I met several fellows I had not seen for some time. The first was Keith McMurtrie I had not seen for 13 years, the next was a Lieutenant who came over with me as a Corporal & then I met a chap who was one of the first wounded I met. I slept well the first in camp after listening to an impromptu concert in the big Y.M.C.A tent. this tent has done good for the men being crowded every night.\n","266":" Shifted camp today to another site as diptheria had broken out in the 2nd Brigade and were quarantined. We worked very hard finishing about 5.30 PM & had tea about 6. I thus had a heavy day for my first day in camp but enjoyed myself well. The fellows treated me well when leaving the 1st. A.S.H. & the Officers I saw before leaving expressed sorrow at my going & wished me \n\ngood luck. I brought a letter of recommendation over with me but have heard nothing of it since I handed it in. Tomorrow I will try & see some old friends in other units that I have not seen for some time.","267":" appointed mess orderly for the day but found the work very light. Put on to carrying water & cleaning up around the tent in the morning. Q.M’s fatigue in the afternoon & carried up the bread. Cigarettes matches & beer issued, 1 bottle between two men The man in YMCA tent put up a notice about the material being taken from the tent. He afterwards told me 100 chairs had been taken away in 3 weeks not to speak of books papers etc. Having a couple of Quidlets I handed in a 5\/- subscription as I appreciated the benefits of the tent. Received a small mail, one letter from Dad. Two nights ago the \"Hythe\" was run down and sunk by the \"Redbreast\" on her way to the Dardanelles. Actual loss of men not let out but it is between 50 to 100 men. This is the second time this has happened & shows carelessness as they have a special route given them although\n\nthey of course carry no lights. The submarines have been very active here lately sinking 8 & damaging one vessel in one week they were of course only small vessels but they were mostly vessels carrying firewood etc. Could they repeat this performance often we would feel the pince as all water, firewood, food etc has to be brought to us. Other vessels sunk lately included one with a large mail , the \"Silver Ash\" I believe & one which had New Zealand A.M.C. & a few nurses aboard but the real truth of these matters we seldom get. Song service at night in which I joined heartily & afterwards listened to a first class address. \n","268":" A very easy day & just as well as I had a bilious attack. It is always the same when I shift camp, either the excitement (if any) or the new water or a little of both brings on a little constipation. Walked to a village in the afternoon & bought some figs & leeks, these or spring onions I enjoy very much & never miss a chance of getting some . Received an issue of one pair of drawers & a cardigan jacket, very acceptable this cold weather.\n","269":" was told off with a party to clear our old lines up & this completed the morning. In the afternoon went and had a first class bath & then to see Andrews. He is now a chaplain but has had some illness and & leaves in a couple of days for England. Bought some Quaker oats 1\/8d a pct, for porridge in the mornings & made a little fireplace all complete. First class concert at night by New Zealanders, & some Maoris brought the house down with a Haka twice repeated.\n","270":" On guard, the first time for some 5 months. First guard was from 3AM to 7 AM but I did not turn out till 5AM as it was all nonsense having a guard at all So I took a risk & slept in. Made porridge this morning & toast, both of which proved very acceptable. Spent the morning printing some more photos. Guard again 3P.M.till 7P.M.\n","271":" had a day off & went across to see the 1st A.S.H. again . The weather was very rough and going across in the ferry I managed to get somewhat drenched & rain coming on completed the job. The sun coming out during the afternoon dried me again O.K. I managed to pick up a registered parcel of printing paper sent me, from the post office & in the village collected some coins, & buttons & bought some spring onions & skin shoes as worn by the natives to send home as\n\na curio. Then after collecting some reading matter I said farewell to the boys who were leaving for Anzac & returned back to camp to find 1 paper, two parcels & three letters awaiting me, truly a splendid day. The parcels contained a sheepskin vest, cap comforter scarf, socks, writing paper, photos & an autograph camera & films in a lovely leather case. I spent a real good half hour opening my treasures. \n","272":" spent the morning in stretcher drill which proved somewhat of a stretcher. In the afternoon had a game of cricket & managed to knock up 13 runs being second top score on my side. Wrote some letters at night in the Ymca tent.\n","273":" Mess orderly for the day. The artillary camped alongside left for Anzac leaving a lot of stuff behind & we all managed to get a supply of jam, tobacco, boxes tea & writing paper etc etc also some vessels for carrying water. The weather beautiful and warm & wearing shorts a pleasure. Splendid concert at night in the crest of a hill run by the New Zealanders. A Bonfire was built in the centre & the piano obtained from the YMCA & the effect was very picturesque. Several nurses were present also Naval officers as guests. The light from the fire shone upon the surrounding faces & incidentally helped \n\nto keep us warm\n","274":" struck trouble this morning. I, with several others fell in on parade with the top button of our coats undone & we picked out & put on a fatigue as punishment. This consisted of filling in old latrines. The whole corp was however put on pitching new tents in place of the existing ones & there was plenty of work to do. I managed to get about 14 lbs of potatoes & a tin of gooseberry jam from a tent nearby. I could not tell whether they were left by the outgoing men or not but gave myself the benefit of the doubt & took them. In the afternoon I went across to my friend at No2 to get some films being developed for me also to get some backsheesh goods It was a most successful trip & I brought back a bottle of wine, 8 candles, tea sugar, tin of milk & a plate, coming back I waded across the lagoon but the surface of the water had a film of Grease on it with the result that I received a good coating of grease on my legs & I had to walk home & wash it off before I could get dressed again.Monday","275":" More tent pitching in the morning. In the afternoon \n\nI went & had a good bath at the waterhole & finished washing the grease off my legs. Had physical drill before breakfast.\n","276":" Physical drill before breakfast. after breakfast we marched about 4 miles to the Ocean beach & had a great swim. Several hundred New Zealanders were also there. The water was very cold but it was very enjoyable after the march. We passed some large encampments of British soldiers & there must be many thousands of troops resting here just now. We also passed an Officers training camp. The bay in which we swam contained about a dozen mine sweepers also store & supply ships. One can only gain some slight idea of the magnitude of these operations by moving about when fresh evidence is always showing up of the work going on. Spent the afternoon doing some photos. At night six of us had a banquet, the night we chose being the anniversary of th ‘Emden Sydney Clash’ we voted it the best we had had for months & consisted of sardines & salmon, tinned fruit, biscuits & a bottle of wine\n\nto cap off. We all had to go for a walk before turning in.\n","277":" Put on the Water fatigue which is rather easy so had a fairly easy time writing and doing some photos. A football match was held during the afternoon. N.C.O.’s & officers against the privates. The privates won.\n","278":" The great event happened we were reviewed by Lord Kitchener. We were formed up with the second brigade & a few others & he walked slowly down the line, towering above all his companions. In appearance he has altered somewhat being older & not so virile, his face having a bloated appearance. We then formed up into a hollow square & he said a few words to us Australians, I am here to thank you today in the name of the King, the People, the Army, & myself for the good work you have performed. It has been excellent & although has not had the required effect, it has undoubtedly prevented the Turkish Army from helping our enemies elsewhere.\n\nThe speech was thus very moderated & he described our work as excellent which describes things much better\n\nthan saying we performed deeds unheard of in warfare. Nothing is gained by exaggeration. In the afternoon I printed off some photos. \n","279":" On guard 11 P.M. to 3.A.M. & 11A.M. till 3 P.M. Wrote up my Xmas mail & sent it off also several photos of myself on post cards.\n","280":" Mess orderly for the day & in addition general fatigue which kept me going in the morning. During the afternoon I went for a stroll taking a few photographs. I also explored a windmill & watched it working. After that I strolled through two villages & poked round in general watching women winding cotton, breadmaking etc. etc. One thing I cannot help but notice & the same thing strikes others. I have never seen a W.C. attached to any Greeks residence & what convenience they have in this respect I do not know. No doubt I could unravel the mystery if I took the trouble but it seems a remarkable thing that after all these months I have never found out the riddle. Ymca tent at night.\n","281":" On parade in the morning we were told to pack up in order to move off in the morning. We spent the morning deciding what we could do without & fixing up our kits & the afternoon loading up wagons. After tea I took some letters over to be posted & attended church service in the Y.M.C.A. having a real good sing song of hymns.\n","282":" Did not move off as expected although we sent off our gear to the jeep leaving a guard of six men. We spent the morning doing a route march & drill in the afternoon for one hour. Sing Song at night in the Y.M.C.A.\n","283":" Was told off to go a message to the No.3 General which took all the morning. One hours drill in the afternoon. That night just as we were dosing off orders were given for us to move off in the morning & I thanked my lucky stars I had had a bath & clean change that afternoon.\n","284":" Reveille 4.30.A.M. Breakfast 5.15 A.M. We were supposed to be ready to move off by 6.A.M. Six wagons arrived five of which the remainder of our gear was placed\n\non, amongst which was my kitbag, I managed to smuggle it on in case we had to carry our personal goods. We were then told to put our blankets etc. on the other wagon but they were thrown on so hastily that they kept falling off. Things had not gone too smoothly & our officers were in a proper rage & started to have an altercation in front of the men but wisely stopped. The Colonel then called us a B---------- rabble & he was not far wrong. Well we marched off following the 2nd Brigade round the lagoon & through the Hospital where nurses & others gave presents to the men as they passed milk chocolate tobacco etc. By 11 o clock we were aboard the \"Waterwitch\" a ferry boat maneuvering to get aboard the \"Mocambique\" to proceed to Anzac. The weather was not at all suitable a strong wind blowing & it was with the utmost difficulty we were transferred. Most of us then had dinner, biscuits & bully when we were ordered to disembark & return to land. It was not exactly a blunder us being aboard, but we should not have been allowed to embark at all seeing what the weather was like. The wind was blowing a perfect gale now & sand &particles\n\nof stone & grit were blown into our face stinging unmercifully. We had to get back to camp however & struggled on with our blankets & packs in the teeth of the wind. The majority decided to halve the distance by wading across the lagoon & I joined this number. It was an exciting trip. We took off our pants, carrying everything on our shoulders as the water was waist deep but the gale worked up the water into waves which broke against us & splashing right over the shorter men. After reaching the other side we discovered our camp had been broken up and as it was getting dark we were in a pretty mess The second Brigade were accommodated in the Y.M.C.A. tent while we were loaned a marquee into which we cramed for the night. After tea & 2 cups of hot coffee from a Greek Canteen I turned in & spent a good night luckily I had stuck to two blankets which proved just sufficient with my Great Coat.\n","285":" Reveille 6.30 . After breakfast drill & a route march. It turned out a lovely day but the wind was piercingly cold as if coming off snow. Returned back to camp 11.30 & received a small \n\nmail. After dinner had an hours drill then after being dismissed I walked to an adjacent village in order to buy a frying pan to use on the Peninsular. An enamel one cost me 2\/-. The place was crowded with men, a camp being close by & the Greeks were taking some hundreds of pounds easily. I watched a blacksmith making nails by hand from iron rods & it was very interesting illustrating the way it was done in the older days. After \"Snapping\" the house used as headquarters & a group of women I returned to camp.\n","286":" Physical drill before breakfast then ordinary drill afterwards. During the afternoon laid out a new camp & all our gear 9 waggon loads, was brought back from the Pier. We are evidently going to stay here and act as a kind of hospital. We do get shoved about Some & there appears to be bungling somewhere. Authentic news of the sinking of one transport with 1000 bags of mail aboard, mostly Australian, was received today & rumours of 5 others within a week. Unless the\n\nloss of life is heavy it is rarely published in the papers. There are evidences of another big move going on as fresh troops are expected. Accommodation for 10,000 wounded has also been ordered which if judged by former occasions means considerably more. Perhaps this move will have the desired effect & we will be able to see the end. The sooner the better.\n","287":" Physical drill before breakfast. We then pitched a new camp to act as a hospital holding about a hundred patients. What the idea is I do not know. Perhaps we will shift again in a few days. The days work was pretty stiff but I felt well & enjoyed it especially as a cold wind was blowing all day. Managed to get a good \"possie\" in the new tent & as I write this feel very comfortable & at peace with the world.\n","288":" A cold bitter day. A gale of wind blowing all day piercingly cold. Appointed mess orderly for the day so did not have much to do. Went across to No 2 A.S.H. during the afternoon & found it a pretty severe trip. The wind had banked up the water in the lagoon until it spread\n\n \n \n\nabout another mile along the flats which made the walk around much further. I would not have attended it only I had some home letters to get away. Church Service at night in the Y.M.C.A.\n","289":" General fatigues round Camp, digging trenches and erecting tents. Pay in the afternoon received £ 2 Weather bitterly cold & strong wind. Greatcoats worn all day. On Guard 6 P.M. 10 P.M.\n","290":" On Guard. Drew for shift & was fortunate in getting the best one 6 to 10. So have now finished for the day. Applyed for leave Thursday. Weather same as yesterday no cessation of cold wind. Find it no hardship however having plenty warm clothing. Have made a cupboard to keep my food etc. in & to act as a table.\n","291":" Pick & shovel work in the morning. Afternoon putting up tents. After tea walked round to the A.D.M.S office to get my pass endorsed for Castro. Lord Ennismore Major signed it. The old trouble with my heel is coming on again, it first having troubled me at Abbissich.\n\n \n \n","292":" My day for leave. After breakfast sent off for the hot baths about 6 miles walk intending to go on to Castro if feeling good enough. We wasted too much time however & arrived at the Baths about 12. I found these to be nothing elaborate but genuine hot mineral spring water with a very high temperature. The entrance room measures about 8 x 6 in which I undressed & then stepped into the actual Bath Chamber, paved with marble, whitewashed walls. After washing in stone basin, one steps into the bath about 4 feet deep, into which the hot water is continually running. I stopped in rather too long & became drowsy & on getting out & into the dressing room, felt as if I might \"go off\", so opened the outer door to let some cold air in. Altogether it was very enjoyable, although the show was very crude after seeing the Roman Baths at Bath. We then had dinner & returned home via the mule track through the hills. Everything very barren looking hardly a vestage of herbage to be seen, nothing\n\nbut rocks & more rocks. The main road to Castro proved to be a very fair one, being now kept in repair by the military.\n","293":" Mess orderly. Weather cold","294":" Long march in morning which took me all my time to do as I had a bilious attack & a sore foot. This is my second attack since coming to this country & I thought I had lost them for good. These attacks make me feel wild & snappy with everybody. Very cold with a little rain. Nothing doing during the afternoon.Sunday","295":" Bitterly cold & bleak day. Strong wind blowing with sleet and soft snow falling. Physical drill before breakfast as usual & Church Parade at 11 o’clock. After dinner I decided to walk to No 2 in order to get my mail away. Six miles through a strong wind & driving sleet. I managed to get a pair of mittens & bed socks whilst there. I arrived back at 5.30 several saying they would not have done the trip for a pound. It was not a pleasure jaunt with me but done to get the mail away.\n\n \n\n \n \n\nAfter tea went to the Song service in the Y.M.C.A.\n","296":" Very cold. Wind still blowing. Out doing drill at 7, ice everywhere, all pools of water being frozen which did not thaw during the day. At the water tanks, lovely icicles were hanging also masses of ice, some cold. Did an eight (8) mile march before dinner which severely tried my capabilities. Quick marching was the order & what with a sore heel, bad boot & pains in one knee I felt anything but happy & then on returning was told off for Guard. 10 P.M. till 2 A.M. shift. I rather fancy most will be spent between blankets. New arrangement made allowing us to do 2 hours only during the night which I managed without undue effort.\n","297":" Beautiful sunny day but cold & ice remained all day still it was a splendid change. On guard 10 till 2. Big mail arrived but nothing for this unit. Patients now number 46.\n","298":" Very mild weather. Appointed mess orderly. So had\n\n \n \n\na quiet day.Thursday","299":" Was told to do night work in hospital so had day free. Hours 10 P.M. – 7 A.M. but as patients all fairly right most of the shift is spent in bed. In the afternoon went out on a Greek boat to a storeship to get some extras. Fish margarine 1\/- lb, Tinned fruit, chocolate etc. etc. Bought some extra chocolate to sell to the chaps & made my boat fare out of it. This is a regular thing for a few of the fellows to do the crowd agreeing to pay expenses in this way. The Greeks prices are double in many cases of what we pay out on the ships. Nothing doing during hours of duty.\n","300":" Went for a walk in the morning & a doze in the afternoon going on duty at 10 P.M.\n","301":" Received letter from Anzac. Weather still fine. Had a bath at well during afternoon then a sleep. Duty at night.\n","302":" Slept during morning. Went for a long walk in afternoon in afternoon & came on some marshes were several men were shooting. After wild geese, ducks etc. One ass nearly winged me. He was using ball & two shots just wizzed by & buried themselves in the mud.\n\nLater I met a Captain of a Collier having a stroll & he has promised to bring me ashore tomorrow any papers he can gather. Weather dull but fine.\n","303":" Spent a very fair night although I went to bed till 10 after taking some Aspirin. Pains were running all through my nether limbs but had eased considerably by 10 P.M. when I went on duty. In the morning I went to get a sleep in the sleeping tent but found a fellow ding carpentering there who refused to shift necessitating me bringing along the needful authority to do so. This afternoon I went to meet my Captain friend & received 3 magazines & a paper. It was all I could do to walk from the pains coming on very badly. I hope the Rheumatism is not getting me.\n","304":" Put on a new shift. 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. Nothing much doing however. Had Rheumatic pains all day & have felt off colour generally. Received a parcel 2 pairs socks. Weather mild but fair & dull.\n","305":" Feeling dead off but manage to get along without going sick. Received an issue of Red Gross Gift.\n\nstuff today. The goods received were very mixed & assorted so bundles of equal value were made up & then we drew fro them. My lot consisted of one towel, one pair socks, 1 bottle sauce & small writing tablet. Weather mild & dull.\n","306":" Spent a bad morning, severe headache etc. but it went off by midday & I felt well enough to do some washing. Usual duties in the morning. Played \"house\" after tea & had a good time ending up by losing 1\/- worth it for a night’s amusement.\n","307":" Felt much better quite lively in fact. Much cheered up by receiving my Xmas Cards from London done to my own design. They have turned out splendidly. Decided to send in my application for transfer to N.1 A.S.H as dispenser by arrangement with the new O.C. Had he been here before I should now be with them. Weather still fine & mild very enjoyable. Indications of expected big move increasing daily. I trust it will be successful.\n","308":" Feeling pretty fit again. Weather still good. Our football team played No. 3 General today & beat them 22 to 7. Sent in an application for transfer as Staff Sergt Dispenser to the No 1 A.S.H. today, our Colonel being quite agreeable which was more than the last man would do. The No. 1 A.S.H. are at Anzac & are a real good crowd but I really do not care whether it comes off or not, we might get a shift here soon which fact will brighten things a little. This lying around doing half a man’s work is no good. Heard that Morris has arrived in Egypt but have not yet heard from him. More rules & regulations were read out today restricting the troops, which fact has been brought about by the troops themselves playing up. Castro is now forbidden as fellows kept getting drunk there. This hits many very hard as it makes a real good trip. Wet canteens have been closed on the island & the sale of alcohol absolutely forbidden all because of asses who cannot control themselves. ‘Tis always the same, the majority are penalized for the excesses of a few, Posted away several of my Xmas cards.\n","309":" A beautiful day, In the afternoon went across by boat to No.3 in order to see a friend. I left some letters with him for the post & then had a walk around to see what alterations had gone on. The work going on is wonderful, thousands of men are engaged in all kinds of work imaginable tents, marques wooden, brick, stone, & canvas erections are everywhere while motors & wagons of all descriptions are flying everywhere. Even the modern railway is here although but a narrow gauge. A huge water still is in full working order after having taken several months to build the work being done by staff of special mechanics from England. Carpenters from England are mostly engaged in erecting canvas & other huts for the housing of nurses & patients whilst Egyptians are employed in making seats forms & other such things used in the hospitals. Arab Gippy & Soudanese labourers are employed on refuse work as well as pier building & road making. They move about singing their river song, as if life was dead within them only showing life when anything is available to steal, or else their foreman whips them into some action. These foremen or overseers use enough abuse to their men to fill a book with no affect.\n\nunless the whip is used. Hindoos & Indians are employed solely on mule carts being on the whole willing & industrious workers as keen as the splendid small mules they drive. Then there is a constant stream of soldiers. Representatives of perhaps every regiment can be seen here although badges & such like distinguishing marks are conspicuous by their absence except in the case of reinforcements and later arrivals. Australians can be seen in Tommy clothing but they nearly always have a mark of some kind showing that they are Australians. Amongst this mass of men one sees occasionally the welcome & cheering sight of a white woman. Whether she be an English, Australian or Canadian Sister all heads turn to gaze after them as they pass, truly a sight for sore eyes to see a woman once more. Officers high & low are so common that except the Tommies we take no notice of them. The Australian does not like saluting & rarely does so unless he runs into it. The monotonous tones of the Khaki is relieved by the blue of the naval men. Officers & men are constantly ashore fraternizing with the soldiers taking advantage of being in harbour for excurcing on land. And so it goes on day after day with no\n\n \n \n\nwith no seeming end to it all.\n","310":" Beautiful weather on duty during morning but went off in the afternoon to get aboard the \"Swiftsure\". Getting a boat proved very difficult as the Greeks did not like going the long run when shorter runs were paying better. At last I went with some officers & borrowed their boat to continue on to the Swiftsure. I arrived just in time for afternoon tea, rather late so did not stop there long. So after having a yarn, reading the latest telegrams etc. I had to return promising to go again. Arrived back at camp about 7 P.M.\n","311":" Two of the 1st A.S.H. chaps arrived & had breakfast with me. This was the first news I had of their arrival so after dinner went along to see the rest of them. In the short time they were at Anzac they had 4 killed & 3 wounded, 17 in all being sent to base. I met 3 of the officers who were in the camp & each spoke of me transferring & hoped it would come off. Plans must have been altered after they left here as they did no\n\nwork whatever at Anzac, simply went up there, prepared a Hospital spending about 5 weeks there & then returned to Semnos. The evacuation of certain points of the peninsular now seems to be going on. Not only troops are being removed but stores & ammunition as well & old trenches etc. being mined along with the idea of checking the Turks advance. Piers are being built along the beach to facilitate the embarkation. Should this take place one wonders what effect it will have on our prestige. Perhaps they have a better plan. I hope so for the sake of the spirit & morale of the troops. Time will tell.\n","312":" More troops arriving from Anzac daily & things must be now coming to a head. After duty I went to the 1st A.S.H. & interviewed the O.C. I asked him his opinion of my transfer & he said he would be very pleased to have me but he was unable to give me the rank immediately & I told me that I fancied that that would be the stumbling block. I returned home & thought it over. More yarns about the evacuation. One subject\n\nof great sorrow to many was the news that several thousand gallons of rum had been emptied at Anzac owing to the difficulty of removal.\n","313":" Once more threaded my way to the 1st. A.S.H. & handed in an application for a transfer and asked the O.C. for a letter stating under what terms the transfer would take place. This he gave me & it stated that all N.C.O. positions were filled but he would give me the first vacancy. Had tea with the warrant officer & received a letter from Laughland & Mackay telling me that my cards cost £ 2-18 the hundred including 15\/- for the die for the Australian badge. This was very satisfactory & very reasonable to my mind as they will be a lasting souvenir of Gallipoli.\n","314":" Anniversary of my going into camp. Twelve months have gone by since I first entered into the active military life in Moore Park Sydney and what a lot has happened since? What dreams have been dispelled? 8 or 9 months ago we set off cheerily to attack the Turk in his stronghold\n\n \n \n\npractically none of us dreaming for a moment of a campaign lasting more than three months. Our leaders had prepared posters to leave in captured ?villages. We received full instructions concerning our treatment of the inhabitants & were told that prices would be fixed, in fact everything was taken into account bar the Turk himself & now eight months after an heroic landing & sacrifice of I expect 35000 Australian casualties we are now evacuating Anzac & possibly other positions. What will the world say? What will Australia say? Will she heave a sigh of thankfulness that we have given up a position which was whitling away our manhood? Or will she become enraged at leadership which caused the heavy casualties without any measurable benefit? From what I can gather the majority of the stores ammunition etc. will be removed in time but a great quantity will be destroyed.. The men still on the Peninsula are given practically a free hand with the stores & are living as millionaires. Tinned chick & other delicacies are freely distributed as what is left will be destroyed. What guns are being left are to be blown up & altogether I have\n\nhopes the evacuation will come off peacefully & without any great loss. Saw the Colonel this morning concerning my transfer. He was very decent but advised me not to go under any other terms than promotion to Staff Serg. at once. When Colonel Powell was prepared to grant that he would have much pleasure in granting the transfer & he ended up by saying that if he delayed doing so any time he would probably find it too late as the promotion would come from my own corps first. So this ended the matter. I was not disappointed or sorry, I never really expected the transfer to be granted but thought it no harm to try if with no other result than to bring myself under our new O C’s notice, actually a case of \"working one’s nut\". Yesterday was cold & bleak with promice of more to comebut today was delightful real spring weather. All news from the Eastern theatre of war is disquieting. Servia captured, our troops in retreat, Greece a constant menace, evacuation of Peninsula or portions of it & rumours galore of troubles elsewhere. So ‘tis not with the best prospects of the future that\n\nI finish up this diary. I am still however perfectly confident of victory my only doubt being whether another Xmas will come & go before the end, I sometimes fancy it will.\n\n For myself I don’t care but for others & the untold suffering still to come, my poor mother & other fellows’ mothers. What must they suffer? Whilst we, in our callousness perhaps getting stronger each day, let month after month go by & are called heroes etc. get all the praise & limelight whilst the mothers & silent workers at home get nothing but the time to eat out their hearts with dread. Perhaps we get killed, who suffers most but the home folk. Personally I don’t fear death for myself but for the effect it would have on those at home. Some might say that ‘tis only conceit to think so but I can now realize something of my mother’s love for one of her sons. I know this, that if it is my good fortune to return home safe after this war I will return home a better man than when I left & I say this in all sincerity and a strong faith in the hereafter\n\n"}}
