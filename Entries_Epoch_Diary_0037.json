instruction.\n","6":"\n\nLeft Liverpool at 8 p.m., riding all night, and arrived Sydney 7 a.m. in the morning. Loaded horses and gear on Transport A29, \"S.S. Suevic\" and anchored out in harbor.\n","7":"\n\nLeft dear old Sydney 2 p.m. Sea very rough coming through the Heads.\n","8":"\n\nA concert on board. Passed through Bass Strait into Great Australian Bight. Went on guard at 6 p.m.\n","9":"\n\nStill on guard. Tough chicken for dinner.\n","10":"\n\nOrders issued that all letters that contained any\n\ninformation as to our whereabouts etc., would be destroyed.\n","11":" \n\nArrived Albany, Western Australia and anchored in King George’s Sound.\n","12":"\n\nLeft Albany 9 a.m., a fleet of 16 ships and one submarine, AE2 (since lost in the Sea of Marmora). Sailed in three columns, \"Ceramic\" leading one, \"Ulysses\" (flagship) one, and Themistocles leading the Berrima in front with A.E.2, and Ayrshire falling rapidly astern.\n\n1915\n","13":"\n\nNew Year’s Day.

The Suevic, Persic and Ceramic held on their course for Aden.\n","17":"\n\nPassed small island thickly covered with palm trees. Dozens of sailing boats out fishing, & the remains of a wreck on a reef.\n","18":"\n\nVery bad throat for 4 days, the after effects of vaccination. Cured by ship’s doctor.\n","19":"\n\nArrived at Aden, and began coaling. The antics of the natives are very amusing, as they come alongside in small boats selling fruits, cigarettes, fish, etc., trade being conducted by means of small baskets tied to thin ropes. Moored to same buoy as R.M.S. Morea. On guard again.\n","20":"\n\nSaw funeral of an infantryman from the Ceramic. He was buried on shore, and we could see the coffin on a gun-carriage, covered by a Union Jack. The battalion band and a party from the Ceramic formed the cortege. Aden is a dry desolate looking place. The coaling is done by niggers who make a most awful noise as they work, (or pretend to).\n","21":"\n\nLeft Aden, and began the passage of Red Sea. Weather very hot. Passed numerous islands.\n","22":"\n\nArrived Suez 7 a.m.\n","23":"\n\nEntered Suez Canal at 10 a.m. Passed English warship, our band playing \nGod\n the National Anthem. Both sides of canal well fortified and manned by New Zealand, Australian, and Indian troops. Very sandy and dry country with here and there a lovely oasis. At 12 a.m. passed H.M.S. Himalaya and saw a few Egyptian troops. Some New Zealanders gave us an exhibition of a Maori dance and war-cry, which was much appreciated. At 12.30 passed H.M.S. \"Minerva\" & at 1 p.m. passed into a lovely lake, where there were a few steamers waiting to pass through. There were a few cranes and pelicans to be seen also. All our boats had their bridges barricaded with bales of hay and had machine guns mounted ready for action. At 1.30 we passed H.M.S. Swiftsure and a destroyer, and at 2 p.m. the French cruiser \"Requin\", and a torpedo\n\nboat. Our band played the \"Marseillaise\", all standing to attention. At 7 p.m. anchored in a lake at Ismalia, a town on left side of canal. Large camps on both banks of canal.\n","24":"\n\nAt 8 a.m. saw two of our aeroplanes flying very high. 9 a.m. we tried to leave but were stuck in the mud and were finally towed off by two tugs. Very pretty xxxscenery for a few miles. At 12 a.m. we caught a glimpse of the Turks at war, about five miles away. We could see, with glasses, the Bengal cavalry galloping into action and smoke and dust rising. At 3.30 arrived at Port Said, anchoring about fifty yards from the wharf. The buildings seemed rather good. Three French hydroplanes rose from the water, went for a flight, and returned to the water close to our boat. It was a grand sight. A strenuous football match was in evidence between some English and French blue jackets. We were serenaded by some musicians in a rowing boat, one of the violin players being an expert in the art of catching coins in an\n\numbrella. On guard, as usual.\n","25":"\n\nLeft Port Said at 8 a.m., passing the monument erected to De Lesseps, the man who first began the construction of the Suez Canal. Soon we passed out into the open Mediterranean, which was calm.\n","26":"\n\nArrived Alexandria 8 a.m., & moored to wharf. Unloaded our horses and gear, and reloaded them on a train. At 3 p.m. we said good bye to the Suevic, and left Alexandria, bound for Cairo, the capital city of Egypt. It was a most interesting trip for us. We passed long green irrigated fields covered with Bersim (Egyptian lucerne), and saw natives at work ploughing, with wooden ploughs and oxen, just in the same way as did the olden-time Egyptians. Everything in Egypt seems to be conducted as they were in the days of the Pharoahs, excepting, of course, innovations introduced by the British, such as irrigation, railways, etc. We arrived there at 8 p.m., untrucked our horses,\n\nwatered them at Kasr-el-Nil Barracks, and led them a good eight miles to Ma’adi camp. It was 1 a.m. when we reached camp and tied the horses up, & lie down on the sand to try & snatch an hour’s sleep. The cold was intense, and we had no blankets. The horses were frantic with joy to be once again on land, after being cooped up on board ship for six weeks. Ma’adi is an awfully sandy dusty place, although rather interesting, as near here was fought one of Napoleon’s great battles, the \"Battle of the Pyramids\". There is an old time cannon almost buried in the sand not far away, and one can pick up pieces of old shells. The camp is a mile from the River Nile, and the Pyramids can be seen quite plainly. All around the camp are Arabs with donkeys for hire, working camels, and shops for the sale of curiosities, antiques (made on the premises) and silks, etc. The Ma’adi railway station is distant, about 400 yards, and some fine residences are near, with lovely gardens.\n","27":"\n\nOn \"Flying Picquet\", to keep the Arabs away from the camp. I was on foot, and the Arabs were too fast for me, so I threw stones at them. I was wishing for a horse and a 12 ft. stockwhip. Our horses were unfit to ride for a fortnight, and we had some solid rifle & bayonet drill. At 12 o’clock at night I was called up to go on fatigue, to unload transport waggons. I did not like it, after chasing niggers all day. Worked till 4 a.m.\n","28":"\n\nWas sent into Cairo with 12 others to guard chaff, etc., lying in railway yard. Had very little to do, and had a good look round in Cairo. Was surprised at the numerous nationalities to be seen. There were English, French, Russians, Greeks, Armenians, Turks, Italians, Arabs, Soudanese, and a few Japs and Chinese. Had a little trouble at first with Egyptian coinage, but we soon picked it up after being cheated hand over fist for a while. Everywhere one goes there is an eternal cry for \"Backsheesh\".\n\nWhile on guard we saw a Hospital train come in with wounded from the Canal, mostly Turks, with a few Indian troops. Most of the Turks seemed to be shot in the feet.\n","29":"\n\nWent to Cairo, and thence out to Gizeh to the Zoological Gardens. These are very interesting and the most striking things to my fancy, were the wonderful footpaths, with symmetrical designs traced with oval stones, of different colors, and a grotto made of coral. There were also two pontoons used by the Turks in their unsuccessful attempt to cross the Canal, and captured from them by our lads.\n","30":"\n\nWent into Cairo on leave, took a run out to the Citadel, and saw the finest sights I have ever beheld. There is a most wonderful mosque, or Mahommedan Church, with a large marble courtyard, where it is compulsory to wear large slippers over your boots, to avoid scratching the marble. In the yard there is a very deep well, with a remarkable echo. The mosque is lovely with\n\na vast dome and beautiful coloured glass windows. In the centre is a large candelabra of brass, with 72 candles in transparent glass globes, and there are also four other smaller candelabra, the five being hung with polished glass pendants, each about six inches long, the whole reflecting the sunlight that streams in through the windows, and making a scene of splendor. There are also hundreds of electric light bulbs round the walls, and it must be a beautiful sight when lit up. This only takes place generally twice yearly, when the Sultan goes there to pray, or on a visit of royalty. From the walls of the Citadel, which is situated on a very high hill, there is a fine panorama view of Cairo, old Cairo, the Dead City, the Nile, the Pyramids, & for miles around. There are here workshops of the Egyptian Government, and a number of wounded Indian troops are quartered in the yard. It was with regret I turned away from the magnificent scene.\n\nAfter leaving the Citadel, I went to see an old mosque, called after Sultan Hassan, which was built as far back as 1022 A.D., and was bombarded by the armies of Napoleon in 1792, but as the walls are 12 feet thick no great harm was done by the cannon balls, which were small round iron balls, & some of them are still to be seen embedded in the walls. Napoleon took away with him a great bronze door, inlaid with gold and silver, said to be worth £10,000. Until 3 years ago, the mosque was practically a ruin, but Lord Kitchener has had it restored, and in another two years it is to be opened again to the Mahommedans for worship, and also as a University, to take \nit\n 800 scholars. The contractor for the repairs was paid £5000 to put in a duplicate of the door taken by Napoleon. While the repairs were being carried out, a concealed cupboard was discovered in which was a copy of the Koran, (Mahommedan Bible) written 900 years before. It is in perfect order and now stands on a silver table in a new mosque. There is a copy of the first verse of the Koran\n\nengraved on the walls, which reads, interpreted, \"Praise be to God, the Lord of all creatures, the merciful and the compassionate. Direct us to the right way, the way of those that ask to be gracious, not those to whom Thou art incensed, nor of those who go astray.\" At least that is the version given us by a stoney-looking Egyptian of the better class, who constituted himself our guide. There are 365 chains hanging round the walls, said to hold a lamp for every day in the year. There is also a Wishing Pulpit, where you go through holding each others hands, and wishing with all your might, and your wish is supposed to come true. Afterwards we went over to a new mosque, where we saw a lot of tombs of old Egyptian Royalty, each one of marble, mounted with silver, ivory, ebony, etc. There are also a lot of silver candle sticks, each four feet high, worth £1000. It is said that the total value of silver in the mosque is £52000.\n\nOn our way back I went into a large Catholic Church, and was much impressed by the beauty of the architecture inside and the different pictures and altars.\n\nOverhead is the great pipe organ, and along the side are five or six Confessional Boxes, with Catholic priests of different nationality. There were several people praying or meditating on their evil ways.\n","31":"\n","32":" Light Horse went on a route march up the Nile as far as Helouan, camped for dinner, & returned in afternoon. Passed thro’ two native villages, which were both decidedly smelly, & swarms of dirty children rushed out to see us, all yelling for \"Backsheesh, half-piastre\" and frightening our horses into fits.\n","33":"\n\nWent by train to Helouan, a very pretty place. Leaving there went to Cairo to All Saints Church, where there was a fine choral service. Were invited to tea by some nice English people, & had an enjoyable evening. We had some music, and I had tea out of a three handled bowl, called a Wassail bowl.\n","34":"\n\nOur Brigade was astir early to repel an attack on our camp by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Our job was to hold them in check until 2 p.m. but at 5 p.m. we were still masters\n\nof the situation, so we safely claimed a win. The","35":" Brigade bivouacked here for the night. A concert was held in the Stadium at night.\n","36":"\n\nField firing in morning, & bayonet fighting in afternoon. Went to Helouan at night.\n","37":"\n\nFought a retreating sham fight with the 5th. Had another win, & covered ourselves with glory, dust, & perspiration. Went Cairo at night.\n","38":"\n\nWent to Cairo, to church, afterwards invited to tea by Rev. & Mrs. Gardiner. Jumped the fence at Bab-el-Louk in time to catch the 10.30 train home. The preacher at church was a bishop in Jerusalem, and when the Turks took a hand in the war he did a bunk. A gentleman named Hayes sang a lovely solo.\n","39":"\n\nWent to a Methodist tea-fight.\n","40":"\n\nOur Brigade went for a route march to Helouan. Returned 6 p.m. and was warned to take the place on guard of a sick man.\n","41":"\n","42":" On guard. Everyone else having a holiday.\n","43":"\n\nEaster Sunday. Mess orderly.\n","44":"\n\nA holiday in afternoon. A real sandy, dusty beast of a day.\n","45":"\n\nHad a big sham fight near Helouan. Picquet at night.\n","46":"\n\nOutpost work.\n","47":"\n\nHad a big sham fight with A Squadron, and knocked spots off them. Complimented in afternoon by Colonel Cox, who said \"If you do as well at the Front, I will be satisfied.\"\n","48":"\n\nDigging trenches all day, & enjoyed a bit of hard work.\n","49":"\n\nEasy morning’s work, striking tents and cleaning saddlery. In afternoon went to Cairo on leave, and went through the native bazaar. There are hundreds of small shops in the Mousky Street for the sale of jewellery, precious stones, silk table covers, saddles and all sorts of leather goods, and one shop devoted entirely\n\nto the sale of brasses. On my way I saw a native wedding procession in full swing. A gaudy uniformed band headed the show, preceded by a gorgeous-looking Drum-major, who marched along with a silver-tipped staff held proudly aloft. Then came a motor-car, followed by six or eight carriages, and the whole outfit was escorted by a queer assortment of Arabs, who all seemed to think they were in the show too. What a noise too.\n\nAfterwards, I had a look through an old mosque, which had coloured glass windows and wonderfully engraved walls. There were a lot of Mahommedans praying, and a low hum was heard as they repeated their prayers. It is also used as a college and a number of students were scattered around, pouring over books, writing, or wrestling with arithmetic. I was shown an old chair in which one of the old-time Sultans used to sit to read the Bible. Outside the great doorway is the place where executions by hanging were carried out, and still hanging there are great iron weights which were fastened on the feet of the condemned person about to be\n\nbe hanged. This was, presumably, in case the condemned person had an unusually tough neck. The Mahommedans pray 5 times daily at 6 a.m., 12 a.m., 3.30, sunset and two hours after sunset. On the way home I discovered a cake shop run on rather a novel plan (to me). As you enter you \nwander\n take a plate and cake fork from a small table, and wander about the shop, harpooning any cakes that take your fancy. These you pay the cashier for and walk through the shop to an open-air café at the back, and you can obtain tea or any other beverage from the waiters. It is a fine plan.\n","50":"\n\nFinished stables, and fell in for church parade. Lazy afternoon.\n","51":"\n\nCossack outpost training in morning, musketry drill and bayonet fighting in afternoon.\n","52":"\n\nIn morning, we had a plan of a regimental bivouacking camp illustrated out on the desert. We dug trenches, and formed breastworks of stones. Afternoon we filled in trenches dug on the 9th.\n","53":"\n\nMess orderly. Regiment on training similar to yesterday.\n","54":"\n\nSame as 13th. Had an alarm, and raced to our allotted stations. Afternoon we rested, but turned out again, fully equipped at 7.30 p.m. and had two or three hours night manoeuvres, creeping about in a parky wind on cold sand. We could hear a big concert on in the Y.M.C.A. tent. Came in about 10.30 p.m.\n","55":"\n\nHad a busy morning, \nscouting\n scouting, charging, dismounting for action, etc. Rested afternoon.\n","56":"\n\nHad an easy morning, striking tents, cleaning lines, etc.\n","57":"\n\nChurch parade in morning.\n","58":"\n\nSeventy of us in the 6th warned for Cairo military police duty. Were inspected by Colonel Cox before we left and caught the 1.30 train to Bab-el-Louk Station, marching from there to Kasr-el-Nil Barracks. Before going I handed over my horse saddle and other gear to a reinforcement chap named\n\nRidgeway, who used to be overseer on Bogamildi and Terlings. After taking over the tents, etc. from the previous picket, my mate and I, not being on duty, went for a stroll, managing to lose ourselves for an hour or two. However, we got out of the narrow crooked streets at last, and went home. The barracks are very large, & are occupied at present by 1200 Lancashire Fusileers. There is a reading and writing room for the men, also two billiard tables. The walls of the barracks are washed on one side by the waters of the Nile, and one can sit on the wall and drop a pebble straight down into the water. Near at hand is the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge, a steel structure which opens at one end daily at 1.45 and remains open until 3 p.m., to allow the feluccas (native boats) to pass through.\n\nAt each end of the bridge are two great stone lions, beautifully modelled. The excitement and noise of the natives as the boats are passing through is something to be remembered. There are always a lot of\n\nboats waiting, and as soon as the word is given there is a scramble. Each one wants his boat through first, and they all seem to think that noise is the main essential to success, judging by the row they make.\n\nThere are hundreds of vultures hanging round the barracks at meal times, and they come swooping down to take a piece of meat from one’s hand, or to catch food thrown into the air. A railway siding runs directly into the barrack-yard, & there is a tennis court for the use of married soldiers and their wives and stables for the officers’ horses. The museum is only fifty yards away.\n","59":"\n\nOn town patrol from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Had a game of billiards, and had a stroll in afternoon. At 10 p.m. on town patrol again, and had to run in a few who were drunk or absent without leave. At 2 in the morning we went home and Lieut. Cross engaged four carriages to take us and the drivers made a great race of it.\n","60":"\n\nTown patrol 10 p.m. till 2 a.m. Town very quiet.\n","61":"\n\nReveille 7.30. After breakfast watched a sale of 250 donkeys held inside the barrack square. It was the greatest character of a sight I ever saw. The men who were responsible for keeping the donkeys in line used their sticks freely, both on the donkeys and their owners. A real good donkey is worth about £6, but, of course, prices vary. As it turned out afterwards, these donkeys were bought for a special purpose and were used at the Dardanelles. They were landed in one place, & the Turks, thinking they were troops hurried up re-inforcements, and turned shrapnel on them. In the meantime, our men had effected an unexpected landing in another place, and taken the Turks unprepared for them. The donkeys were nearly all wiped out, but they had served their purpose. It was rather rough on the donks, but war is war.\n\nIn afternoon rambled about the lovely Gizeh gardens where are lovely flowers and green grass. Very enjoyable after Ma’adi.\n\nOn town patrol 1.30 till 6 p.m. Helped to keep back the crowd in front of the Greek Club, while they were waiting for the ex-Prime Minister of Greece, Venizelos, to arrive. There was great excitement when he came, in a motor-car. The Greeks yelled \"Zeito, Zeito\" (which means Hurrah), hats were waved and thrown into the air as if they would never be needed again, and a great bobbery was caused. Venizelos is very popular with the people as he is in favour of joining in the war on the side of the Allies.\n","62":"\n\nIn the gardens most of the day. Crossed the Nile in a rowing boat. Had a joke with the boatman and frightened the life out of him almost. On duty at the Esbekieh Caracol at 10 p.m. Had two tables to sleep on, but owing to the native police arresting a lot of women, we did not sleep a wink, as the women squealed and jabbered like hyenas all night, and fought amongst themselves. Next morning two Arab boys were brought in, & soundly flogged by the chief.\n","63":"\n\nSpent most of the day in the Gardens. At 6 p.m. went on duty at Babel-Hadid tramway, to look after the soldiers on the Heliopolis trams. Had no trouble, though. Of course we had no power to interfere with civilians and the native police had no power to lay a hand on us.\n","64":"\n\nAt 9 a.m. had to go to a Greek shop and arrest a soldier who had been absent for 4 days. Town patrol 1.30 p.m. till 6 p.m.\n","65":"\n\nSports in Cairo. French display of 75 c.m. guns, and a French band of 100 performers. Some of the 6th were in giving an exhibition of wrestling on horse-back, Balaclava Melee, etc. Town patrol 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.\n","66":" \n\nSpent the morning in gardens and in afternoon went for a sail down the river as far as Boulac Bridge, which opens up in the centre. The boatman sailed and rowed us about for two hours, for the sum of three piastres (7½ ). No wonder he looked relieved when we got out.\n\nIn the cool of the evening\n\nwe watched the Sunday evening traffic over the bridge. There were carriages and pairs, dog-carts with fine looking horses, motor cars, taxi cabs, donkeys, camels, and now & then a native bus, drawn by three sorry-looking mules. There would come a donkey-cart driven by an Arab, who generally had five or six women perched up behind him, generally his wives or some-one else’s. It all seems very quaint to Australian eyes.\n\nOn duty at Wassaa Caracol 10-7.\n","67":"\n\nIn Gardens most of day. On duty at Wassaa Caracol 6 p.m.-10 p.m.\n","68":"\n\nTown patrol 6 a.m.-9 a.m. Gardens all day. Town patrol 6 p.m., and had a very busy time, over 90 men being arrested. As each man was brought in he was searched, and his boots were taken away, and put up on shelves in the guard room, which looked like a second-hand boot shop. Got home about 3 a.m. dead tired.\n","69":"\n\nTown patrol 1.30 p.m. till 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. till dismiss. Pretty strenuous night. Got home at 2 a.m.\n","70":"\n\nEasy day. On duty Bab-el-Hadid tramway 8 p.m. till 12 p.m.\n","71":"\n\nHad a quiet morning, reading, writing letters, etc. Town patrol 1.30 till 6 p.m., & 10 p.m. till dismiss.\n","72":"\n\nLazy morning, and to our great sorrow & disgust we were ordered to be ready to go home to Ma’adi at 4 p.m. Marched to Bab-el-Louk, and caught the 4.30 train home, when we discovered that our regiment was away at a place called Barrage, 25 miles away. We camped out in the sand again.\n","73":"\n\nPut up the tents, and regiment returned in afternoon.\n","74":"\n\nRifle drill in morning. Not feeling any too well.\n","75":"\n\nSick all day. Went to doctor in afternoon. Same old pills.\n","76":"\n\nWent for a route march to Helouan, intending to bivouac there for the night, but some important message came\n\nthrough to the Brigadier, and we saddled up again and made a bee-line for the camp over the sand-hills, getting nearly choked on the way. All sorts of rumours flying about as to going to the front. Hope they are true.\n","77":"\n\nStruck tents and cleaned the lines. 50 re-inforcements arrived in camp. Our machine gun sections warned to be ready to leave for the front tomorrow.\n","78":"\n\nFell in for church parade. The hymn \"God be with you till we meet again\", was sung in farewell to our machine gunners. The last time I heard that was when the Suevic, with on on board drew away from the wharf in Sydney,","79":" In the afternoon the Brigadier, Colonel Ryrie, made a speech to the machine gunners wishing them luck, and they marched away to the station in a perfect storm of cheers. They are the first of our Brigade to go into action and may God’s grace and mercy go with them.\n\n10th\n\nEarly mounted parade in morning, and a foot parade in afternoon. Very tired at night.\n","80":"\n\nHad mounted parade before breakfast, & rested all day. About 11 o’clock news came through we are to move off on Saturday for the front. The camp is nearly mad with joy. I think it is too good to be true.\n","81":"\n\nEasy mounted parade in morning. In afternoon greased saddles etc. preparatory to handing them in. We are going to the front on foot.\n","82":"\n\nUp at 4 a.m. had some tea, & rode out as mounted patrol to keep the rifle range clear, as the re-inforcements were range shooting. Went to Cairo at night.\n","83":"\n\nHad no parade. Getting kits ready.\n","84":"\n\nCamp astir early. Packed our kit-bags, rolled up our blankets, ground sheets, etc. All issued with putties, & 220 rounds of ammunition. Fell in at 7.50 p.m., and marched to Ma’adi railway station\n\nArrived Bab-el-Louk 9 p.m., formed up and our squadron led the march through the town, to the sounds of cheering, coo-ees, & all sorts of noises. The residents turned out, clapping and waving hats and handkerchiefs. We marched to Bab-el-Hadid, Cairo’s railway station, entrained there, and left for Alexandria at 12 p.m.\n","85":"\n\nArrived Alexandria 6.30 a.m. At 9 a.m. went on board transport A25, formerly the German steamer Lutzow, but now a prize. On guard on the gangway at 11 a.m. At 5 p.m. we left Alexandria, and heading out over the Mediterranean we began our last journey to the Front. Had bully beef and biscuits for tea, and went to sleep in a lifeboat out of which I was emptied by the lying-in-picquet at 12 p.m.\n","86":"\n\nHad nothing to do all day. Sea very calm. Sighted a few transports bound for Alexandria.\n","87":"\n\nHeld a voluntary church service in the morning & Colonel Ryrie made a little speech.\n\nSaw a cruiser away on our port-side, probably an escort. At 3 p.m. we were ordered to be ready to leave the ship, with 24 hours rations, and 24 hours emergency rations. At 6.30 p.m. we passed close to Lemnos, where there is a military camp, and we saw two aeroplanes land there. There are a good many destroyers to be seen. At 7 p.m. we heard the first roar of the cannons. Everyone climbed up the rigging, or anywhere they could climb. 7.15. Now we can see plainly the flash of the guns, and as each roar comes to us there is a terrific cheer from our boat in answer. Everyone is excited, no one thinks of sleep, and no one thinks of going below except one who is making hay while the sun shines, for I miss a pair of new boots when I go down. However that is a mere trifle, for at last we are at the front, and can see the flashes, hear the deafening roars, the crackle of rifles, and can smell the powder.\n","88":"\n\nUp very early, and found that there is a perfect fleet round us. Transports, cruisers, battleships, destroyers, all are here. As we started off we ran foul of a French transport, and were tangled up in a perfect mess for over an hour. Then the guns began again, and soon we saw our airmen flying high over the Turkish trenches and guns, giving our guns range, direction, etc. Then shrapnel shells begin to burst near the machine \nand\n but our aviator goes sailing calmly on. Soon an officer comes on board with our orders, and we are off, twelve miles further up the coast. At 7.30 we have arrived, and cast anchor. We are now a few hundred yards away from Anzac, where we are to land to-morrow, and where the Australian infantry have made for themselves and Australia a name that will never die.\n\nThere was an incessant crackle of rifle and machine guns last night on shore. A fierce fight was fought all night.\n","89":"\n\nUp very early to look at a captive observation balloon. At 2 p.m. we went ashore, and had a long weary walk up Shrapnel Gully, with packs on to which we are unaccustomed. We dug a few temporary dug-outs for ourselves. All over us bullets were cracking and singing, and now & then shrapnel bursts. The doubtful honour of having the first casualty of the 6th fell to our troop Bergelin being hit in the eye by a stray bullet.\n","90":"\n\nBusy at work completing our dug-outs. Colonel Cox wounded slightly in the leg. Four great Black Jack Johnson shells burst close to us. They looked awful, but did no damage.\n","91":"\n\nWas warned to go to Lemnos with Turkish prisoners, but as a G-submarine turned up, we had to wait.\n","92":"\n\nWent into trenches for 28 days. Saw with a periscope hundreds of dead Turks lying just outside our trenches. On observation duty through the night.\n","93":"\n\nOn observation. An armistice was declared between 9 a.m. & 4 p.m., to bury the dead. The enemy and we were sitting on our respective parapets watching each other.\n","94":"\n\nH.M.S. Triumph torpedoed & sunk.

Went into dug-outs vacated by the 7th, who have gone into firing line. On fatigue all day, and at night we went out to dig a trench to some deserted trenches that the Turks prowl about near every night. We dug like rabbits till daylight, and cleared back home.\n","120":"\n\nRested in morning, fatigue in afternoon. Another party of diggers gone out again to-night.\n","121":"\n\nOn fatigue morning, trench digging at night.\n","122":"\n\nRested all day, and had a lovely swim in afternoon which was somewhat spoiled by \"Beachy Bill\" who pitched a lot of shrapnel over our way.\n","123":"\n\nFatigue in morning, & had a swim.

Bob Rodd was wounded and ten others besides, poor Sergeant Fred Ellis died in my arms, Kidman, Obrien, Ronald, and Joe Creer were all killed, and a chap from the 7th also. It was\n\na bad day for our squadron. Of 30 men that went out, 8 came back safely, and they all had \nmajor\n miraculous escapes. I was not sorry when we all got back. A heavy bombardment of Achi Baba was going on and our work was to jump out and make the enemy think we were going to attack, so they would not send any men away to re-inforce Achi Baba. Our demonstration is said to have had the desired effect.\n","143":"\n\nUp at 3 a.m. on water fatigue. Destroyers shelled old Gaba Tepe forts heavily.

At 11 p.m. the bodyguard (12 from each squadron) fell in and marched down to the wharf, where we\n\nboarded the trawler Keravnos, & were taken out to trawler 281, where we stayed the night. There were 25 Australians and 25 New Zealanders.\n","161":"\n\nLeft at 8 a.m. for Imbros. Arrived 10.30 a.m., and were guided to the wrong camp, as usual.

It has been running, it is said,\n\nfor hundreds of years without a break. There is an old city buried near our camp, but only about a ¼ mile of the walls can be seen above ground. There are some small Greek villages on the island but they are \"out of bounds\".

Bacchante a 4 funnelled warship.\n","189":"\n\nM.O. agreed to let me go back again to-morrow, going first to Mudros for M.E.\n","190":"\n\nLeft Imbros 11 a.m. in trawler 848, arriving Mudros 7.30 p.m. At 9 p.m. were transferred to S.S. Aragon, and stayed there the rest of the night.\n\nSeptember\n","191":"\n\nUp early to have a look round. In the harbor were transports, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc., both French and English, and the Russian cruiser \"Askold\", called the \"Packet of Fags\", because she has five long funnels, and they resemble Woodbine cigarettes, five to a packet. At 5 p.m. a launch came and took us to the pier at Mudros West, and we walked up to No. 3 Australian Hospital, where we were made welcome, given tea, and supplied with blankets and mattresses, thanks to Capt. Wall, who was Dr. Wall, of Coogee. There were some nice nurses, too, and Drs. McCormick & Fiaschi.\n","192":"\n\nParaded to the Adjutant, who ordered us to the new Base Hospital for Australians and New Zealanders, three miles away. However, as we seemed to be no nearer getting back than we\n\nwere at Imbros, we cleared out, got aboard a picquet boat (no less) and had the luck to strike \"S.S. Partridge\" just leaving for Anzac, so we all scrambled aboard, and arrived at Anzac 10 p.m. When we landed, I made my way to our trenches. Transport Southland torpedoed.\n","193":"\n\nIn reserve trenches in day, and observation at night, in Somerville’s Post. Plenty of bullets and shrapnel flying about. Arthur Gee, of our squadron badly hit in arm. Feeling very sick.\n","194":"\n\nVery bad with rheumatism. Sent down to","195":" Field Ambulance and sent from there \nby\n to the Hospital ship \"Salta\". Went on a barge with a lot of sick and wounded, but owing to the rough sea, the small launch was not powerful enough to tow us, and we broke adrift a couple of times, and went floating round the harbour, tossing and pitching like the Dickens. However, we were finally rescued by the trawler 971 Rose and towed alongside the Hospital Ship, after tossing about for about 2 hours on a trip\n\nthat generally only takes 20 or 30 minutes. However, we got safely on board, and I was sent to bed.\n","196":"\n\nM.’s birthday. Many happy returns. Still anchored off Anzac, and a lot more sick and wounded came on board. Some also put off \"Salta\" on trawlers, sent to Imbros.\n","197":"\n\nAnother Hospital ship came in through the night. Two men died through the night, and were taken off this morning by the mine-sweeper \"Loch Broom\", and taken \nup\n out to sea for burial, both being covered with the Union Jack. Left at 12 a.m. for Imbros, & left Imbros 3 p.m. for Mudros, arriving there 7 p.m.\n","198":"\n\nLeft Mudros at 9 a.m. for Alexandria. Saw S.S. \"Aquitania\" sister ship of the \"Lusitania\", with four funnels, in Mudros Harbour.\n","199":"\n\nArrived Alexandria 9 a.m. Harbor full of shipping. Left at 2 p.m. for Cairo, in Red Cross train. Had a fast trip, arriving Cairo 5.30 p.m. Taken in Red Cross Ambulances to Gezireh Palace Hospital. This is a lovely place\n\nsaid to have cost about £4,000,000 to build. Formerly belonged to the Khedive of Egypt but confiscated by the Government when the Khedive was deposed. It is situated on the bank of the Nile, which is now in its annual flood. Good library here.\n","200":"\n\nBetter. Able to sleep without morphia, which was given to me nightly on \"Salta\".\n","201":"\n\nParaded before Medical Board. Recommended for Australia.\n","202":"\n\nBoat-load of wounded & sick sent to Australia.\n","203":"\n\nHad a walk through Gezireh Gardens, & watched natives gathering dates.\n","204":"\n\nEight of us were taken for a motor-launch trip, and thoroughly enjoyed it. We went miles up the Nile, which is now in full flood. Saw a few quaint old water-wheels, and a lot of Cook & Sons tourist steamers, now lying idle and deserted. We passed numerous feluccas and native rowing boats toiling slowly along.\n","205":"\n\nWas surprised and pleased by a visit from Leuit. Ferguson, of our squadron, who is going back to the Peninsula in two days time, after five weeks illness. He was in charge of our demonstration on 12\/7\/15, and proved himself a cool game officer under fire.\n","206":"\n\nSome ladies visited the Hospital this morning, talking to us, and bringing flowers.\n","207":"\n\nThree of us taken out in a motor car for a drive to Mena in charge of a sister. Had a look at the Pyramids.\n","208":"\n\nTook Sergeant Smith over to Cairo to the Pay office. He has lost his eyesight owing to shell-shock, but will most probably get it back in two or three months time. Afterwards took him in the launch for the river trip.\n","209":"\n\nWent to see the Aquarium, & saw a lot of queer looking fish. There is a fine grotto there too, and a lovely garden and trees.\n","210":"\n\nTransferred from Ghezireh to Mena House Hospital, situated about 200 yards from the Pyramids. Mosquitoes & flies galore.\n","211":"\n\nTook Sergeant Smith to Cairo. Saw a wedding procession, headed by an Egyptian brass band, & also another procession in honour of a woman who was coming home from hospital, cured. She had two bands.\n","212":"\n\nWent for a walk up to the Pyramids, & got some alabaster.\n","213":"\n\nWent to zoo with McCourt. Had refreshments at \"Island of Tea\".\n","214":"\n\nWent to Ma’adi. The camp is greatly altered, the horses now having shelter sheds. My old horse in great condition.\n","215":"\n\nWent to dentist, and afterwards had a walk round cotton fields.\n","216":"\n\nHad teeth patched up temporarily.\n","217":"\n\nThe hospital grounds all lit up at night, and decorated with flags, for a fine concert\n\nwhich was attended by Prince Henry of Battenberg, Lady Maxwell, a French Countess, Colonel Martin and some more bigwigs.\n","218":"\n\nMcCourt, with 31 others, sent out to Base Detail Camp, Zeitoun.\n","219":"\n\nChurch parade in morning. In afternoon an Italian concert party came out and entertained us for a couple of hours. Went to church service at night, and afterwards went for a walk and saw a Bedouin Arab dance, in honour of an approaching wedding. It was very queer.\n","220":"\n\nTook Sergeant Smith to Pay Office, Cairo. Warned to be ready to leave for home to-morrow.\n","221":"\n\nLeft Mena House at 7.45 a.m. in Red Cross motors, and went to Koubbeh Siding, where we were put on a hospital train. Left Cairo at 11 a.m., and had a good run to Suez. The line runs close to the Canal for a long way. We saw several ships steaming slowly through the Canal, and a good many Indian troops.\n\nArrived at Suez at 5.30 p.m., and were taken on board the Hospital ship \"Kanowna\" (A.U.S.N. line, a sister ship to the Kyarra).\n","222":"\n\nLeft Suez at 7 a.m., passing on our way out the Canadian Hospital ship Loyalty lying at anchor. At 9.30 a.m. met a French passenger steamer.\n","223":"\n\nBurial at sea of a patient who died of brain fever.\n","224":"\n\nFearfully hot, right out in the Red Sea. The ship is vibrating like a milk shake.\n","225":"\n\nStill very hot. Thousands of porpoises chasing shoals of flying fish all round the ship.\n","226":"\n\nSunday – Passed by Aden at 8 p.m., and met an Indian Hospital ship on her way back to the Dardanelles from India. Out of the Red Sea now, thank goodness.\n","227":"\n\nMet transport Argyllshire with Australian troops on board. They passed very close to us, & gave us a great cheering.

Saw a big school of whales, spouting and splashing about.\n","229":"\n\nMet Transport A47, with Australian troops on board on their way to the Front.

Deep-sea sounding going on.\n","234":"\n\nArrived Colombo at daybreak. Saw the steamer Nubian aground near the entrance to the harbor. Her skipper tried to come in at night without a pilot, and made a mess of things. She is fast on shore.\n\nWe took on a pilot, and went into the harbor, mooring to two buoys. A lot of small boats containing natives after the laundry work made a great dash for the gangway, and got all mixed up in a fine tangle. It took two sentries with fixed bayonets to clear them off the gangway. There was a good deal of shipping in the harbor, and a big Dutch liner came in just behind us. At 10 a.m. we received passes to go ashore till 4 p.m. We were rowed ashore in small boats. Then I took a rickshaw and went for an hour’s drive (or ride) along a good road near the coast, past the Galle Face Hotel. Came back then and did some shopping, & there are some large, well run shops in Colombo. Afterwards went round the fruit markets and bought a large bunch of bananas for 1\/-\n\nAfterwards we were taken out for a lovely motor drive by Mr. Bois. He is an Australian residing in Colombo, and he had a lot of cars hired\n\nto take us out to Mount Lavinia, where he had afternoon tea and cigarettes waiting for us. It was very good of him. We went out around the Cinnamon Gardens, the Victoria Fountain, and the different parks and sports grounds. We saw a fine residence that used to belong to the German Consul, who is now in prison. In the gardens are banyan, rubber, and bread-fruit trees and cocoa-nut palms.\n\nSaw a German spy arrested and marched away under fixed bayonets. I got caught in a heavy rainstorm but my coolie pulled the hood of the rickshaw up, and kept me fairly dry. Went back to the ship at 4 p.m., after a very enjoyable day. The Dutch boat left about dusk, making a fine sight as she turned into the open sea with her decks ablaze with lights, on her way to Java. Received news of the result of Caulfield Cup, V.R.C. Derby, & Melbourne Cup.\n","235":"\n\nLeft Colombo at 8 a.m. There was a heavy swell on, and the ship rolled and pitched a good deal. I soon got very sea-sick.\n","236":"\n\nStill sea-sick. Crossed the line late at night. A flying-fish flew right through one of the port-holes into a ward. He was only a small fish.\n","237":"\n\nBeen sea-sick ever since leaving Colombo. Felt a bit better to-day.\n","238":"\n\nPassed the Cocos Islands last night. We were to be taken in close to have a look at the Emden but it was dark before we got to the islands.\n","239":"\n\nBurial at sea of a patient who died last night, after an operation for removal of a shrapnel bullet from the brain. He belonged to the","240":" Battalion. A guard, with fixed bayonets, was drawn up, and the bugle sounded the \"Last Post\" as the body was committed to the sea.\n","241":"\n\nTerribly heavy swell running. The boat has been rolling all day. Every now and then there was a crash, as tables fell over. A lot of crockery was smashed through the day. At 3 p.m. we sighted land, & thus had our first glimpse of Australia. At 7 p.m. we passed the Island of Rottnest, which is now a concentration camp for enemy subjects. At 8 p.m. we anchored in the Bay for the night and we can see the lights of Fremantle.\n","242":"\n\nWeighed anchor at 9.30 a.m. and moved in to the wharf. At 12 p.m. the West Australian patients began to go off, and they got a fairly good reception although there was only a small crowd to meet them. We were then given general leave till three o’clock. Went ashore and had a look round Fremantle and sent some telegrams. The police band came down to the wharf and played there all the afternoon. We pulled out again at 6 p.m. There was a fair-sized\n\ncrowd there by that time. The band played Auld Lang Syne as we moved out. The transport Warilda, A62, came into port during the day, with troops on their way to the Front.\n","243":"\n\nPassed the Leeuwin Light house at 9 a.m. The boat rolling a good deal. At 6 p.m. we passed Albany, and met a troopship A49, heading towards Fremantle. Raining all day.\n","244":"\n\nBoat rolling badly. Plenty more broken crockery. A lot of albatrosses flying about following the ship. Crossing the Bight.\n","245":"\n\nMet a large mail steamer at 4 p.m. Looked like a P. & O. boat. Trooper Kerr, of","246":" Light Horse, Victoria, died after an operation, and was buried at sea at 10.30 p.m. The bugle sounded the \"Last Post\". Raining.\n","247":"\n\nLand in sight again. Passed Kangaroo Island at 8 a.m. A big mail steamer is coming up behind us. Still raining. Arrived off Port Adelaide at 1 p.m., and after taking on a pilot and a\n\nCustoms officer, we drew in to the Railway wharf, where there was a special train for the South Australians. They were soon off the boat and on the train, and then left for Adelaide. There was a fair sized crowd on the wharf. We left again at 4 p.m., on our way to Melbourne.\n","248":"\n\nLand in sight on the port side all the way. Passed a good many coastal boats.\n","249":"\n\nArrived Melbourne at 11 a.m. The Tasmanians went off at 2 p.m., and went on board the Loongana after being taken for a run through the city, leaving for Tasmania at four o’clock.

Two or three transports in the harbour, with troops on board.\n","250":"\n\nWeighed anchor at 3 a.m., and started off for Sydney. Very rough crossing the Heads. Two other boats went back.\n","251":"\n\nPassed Gabo Island at 6 a.m. A Queenslander died today, and was buried at sea. We all came up on deck for the burial service.
