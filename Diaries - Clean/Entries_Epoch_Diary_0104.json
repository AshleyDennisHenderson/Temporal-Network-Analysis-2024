Food supply still a source of bother. \n","8":" \"What Ho she bumps\" Another sensation caused this morning at 3.45A.M. by our ship running on a Coral reef & sticking hard & fast. Very funny to see the nigger crew flying about like paper cats. Wireless calls sent out for assistance. H.M.T. Seang Choon returned to our aid but failed in her efforts to tow us off. Large number of sharks prowling round the ship waiting for someone to drop overboard for lunch. Troops with officers & men turned to in watches to heave coal overboard to lighten ship forard.\n","9":" Still ashore. All hands still working hard on coral heaving.

Had leave to visit the City of Cairo, had a good tour round, there are people of all nations here especially French, there are some fine buildings but the City generally is rotten, it fairly hums, they dont have any sanitary arrangements at all. There does not appear to be any rule of the road. Donkeys, Camels Garrys, Horses etc seem to go where they wish, Of course as one can expect the City is crowded with Soldiers, who the Egyptians profess to like, no doubt on account of their spending powers.\n","46":" Sand storm passed over camp this morning making things very uncomfortable. Very had job trying to keep rifles clean on account of the sand. Usual Church Parades held. Swarm of locusts passed over camp this morning. Had the afternoon to ourselves. Received order to be ready for joining our Battns at any hour which are camped at \"Bernaiul\". Our food supplies are not being managed as they should be.

Reinforcements being put through the various drill movements, & have already gained a good knowledge of the business.\n\n(2) Usual Parades held. Had leave & paid a visit to Cairo this evening just in time to witness the big dust up, and things were real lively. There must have been fully 4,000 men in the mix-up composed chiefly of our own lads, They took charge of one quarter of the City & fairly ran amok, they smashed everything they could lay hands on, windows were bent with bricks, furniture pulled to pieces and thrown from places 4 storeys high, to be gathered up by those in the street to be piled up & ignited, and what fires they were, also had petrol to help them on. Pubs were raided & what couldnt be drunk was destroyed, & in no time about 50 mounted Red Caps (Police) made a charge through the street firing their revolvers on the crowd. & hitting several, then the mob went mad & pulled several of their horses, others were knocked off being hit by bottles thrown at them. Then a company of infantry were marched down & they were pelted the same. The box on lasted about 4 hours & died down. The Dark Town Fire Brigade were brought up to put the fires out & these were also chased out of the street, Order was restored when they brought a strong picquet in from the Mena Camp.\n\n(3) Usual Parades held. All leave to Cairo stopped tonight. A bit of an argument stated in Heliopolis tonight but was soon stopped. Very little damage done.\n","53":" Easter Sunday. Usual Church Parades held. Received orders to be ready for marching off at 4A.M tomorrow morning for destination unknown. 50 men & 3 N.C.O’s Sgt Parsons & myself & Cpl McMillan were told off as an advance party for the 13th great arguments among the lads as to who should be the lucky ones to go.\n","54":" Easter Monday. Turned out at 3A.M. this morning and marched out of Camp for Cairo, it was a wild morning the wind blew very hard & of course the sand played havoc with the lads eyes. After a tramp of 8 miles we arrived at the Railway Station about 7.30A.M. & after a long wait we entrained for Alexandria arriving there about 3P.M. We were taken straight aboard O.A H.M.T. Osmanieh. Appears to be a large amount of shipping here. \n","55":" Beautiful morning. Great scramble after tucker this morning no arrangements made for our coming. The American Cruiser Tennessee is in Harbour here she is a fine vessel. There are a great number of French troops quartered here they look peculiar in their Blue great coat & red pantaloons, some have the new grey uniform . We steamed out about 3P.M this afternoon & had a merry time crossing the Mediterranean Sea., our ship tossed about a treat, at the same time being enveloped in a thick fog, many down with sea sickness. This vessel can go some, she steams 20 knots per hour which is going.\n","56":" Sea much calmer. Still catch-as-catch can with the Tucker. Some of the boys find it pretty tough tackling the new menu viz Bully Beef & Biscuit. We are feeling the change in the weather now it is much cooler. We are steaming among a number of small islands belonging to the Greek Archipelego.\n","57":" Calm Sea. Beautiful sunny morning. Still among the islands.

We passed by several Troopships steaming north. We saw very pretty sunset this evening.\n","65":" Arrived at Alexandria at 6.30A.M. Sick taken ashore & sent by train to Heliopolis. Several of the secure leave to go ashore, had a trip around myself, It is a much nicer place than Cairo, it has a beautiful sea front & some fine buildings & son on, but still has the same old pen & ink (stink) . There are a great mixture of foreigners here but the French & Greeks appear to be the thickest. There was a dust up here this evening between some of our own artillerymen who are camped at \"Mex\" & some native police, things were real lively while they lasted, & was going strong when the Maltese & Italian Police arrived in the nick of time & stopped it. A few fellows were damaged. \n","66":" Beautiful day. The people here dont observe the Sabbath it is just the same as week days. Shops and Hotels etc are all opened and do not close until early morning. Had a stroll round with Signaller McNeil this afternoon, went through the native quarter & native Markets some queer sights, a bloke deserves the V.C. to tackle the food they prepare. \n","67":" No news of when we are going to return to Lemnos. think they must have forgotten us.

Other Troopships preparing to leave.\n","73":" We can hear the big guns booming early this morning & heard our boys had made a landing at Gaba-Tepe & drove the Turks far inland. We left here at 4 this afternoon for Gaba-Tepe & anchored off at 7A.M. what a din, the big warships pounding away at the Turkish Forts & the Turks returning their fire, shells were bursting out over the Bay were numbers of Troopships are anchored one burst over the stern of our boat & wounded 1 chap the bullets fairly hissed as they struck the water. There were Destroyers flying about in all directions towing boatloads of Troops ashore were they are fighting for their lives. One can see the spits of fire from rifles & bursting shells overhead. it was a grand but terrible sight. We are to take a crowd back to Alexandria who are wounded. A great batch of boys came aboard about 8 oclock with all manner of wounds, there was some awful sights to witness. We left about midnight for Alexandria, some of the boys were terribly smashed about & before we reached Alexandria 10 of them died & were buried at sea. We done our best in the way of looking after them , we were only 16 strong. The majority of them disembarked in Egypt with not even being washed the blood all over their uniforms but the majority were very cheerful. It was my misfortune to have been left on Ships Guard as nearly all my old pals were ashore, landing even before the Battn. But perhaps its all for the best as I may have been stopped by a bullet. but it wont be long I hope before we are taken off this job. \n","74":" Was reported to us from Torpedo Boat that a Turkish Destroyer was cruising around & that she had attacked the Transport H.M.T Manitou. And in the scramble 62 of the Troops had been drowned, a large number having been picked up by our destroyer.\n","75":" Fine day. We have not sighted a steamer all day.

Coy with me at Liverpool, also many others I knew very well. Another very pretty sunset this evening, worth any amount of money to see. \n","81":" Edie Mays Birthday 7 years God bless her.

We can see & hear the guns going a treat, & often shells burst over the Troopships the old \"Seang Bee\" had her deck damaged with Turkish Shrapnell. Our boys disembarked about midday, we tried to scramble off with them but were stopped & told we would be guilty of deserting our post aboard Ship, not a bad joke, suppose we will have to remain here until relieved. The Warships have their searchlights going all night. \n","85":" Fighting going on all night, mostly rifle fire, about 5 this morning things got extra willing, Big Guns talked & the air was alive with bursting shells. The Turks artillery fire a great many shells on our landing stage. The noise from \"Queen Elizabeths guns was deafening it fairly drowned all other noises, The shells from her 15 inch guns burst with an awful crash, one would think half of the Hill had been blown away. when her shells struck them, Just after our Sea-planes went to roost a Turkish Aeroplane flew out over the Bay and was immediately fired on from the Warships, but they escaped.\n","86":" Things fairly quiet early this morning, but about 9.30 Queen Lizzies guns broke the solitude & they all took a hand \"Big guns, machine guns & rifle fire & buzzing Seaplanes overhead made things real merry.

All boys went ashore in lighters towed by naval pinnaces 3 A.M. this morning. All anxious for a dust up. joined my old Bn, lots of my old mates still going strong but many faces missing, Some of the lads had heard that the ship I was doing Guard duty on had been torpedoed, & looked rather surprised when they saw me. Parsons & myself went down to Anzac this morning for a dip, but of course had our plesure spoilt by the Turks shelling.\n","116":" Fell in for duty this morning & was attached to No 6. Platoon B. Coy left gully at 7 A.M. & went up on \"Walkers Ridge\" to do some sapping in support trenches. Plenty of stray bullets flying around, a bloke wants to keep his nut down or he will quick get it smacked. The place fairly reeks with dead bodies & other unsanitary arrangements, of course it cannot be helped. The only time they can get to bury the dead is at night time & there is always a risk.\n","117":" until","118":" – Same routine, working & dodging bullets etc\n","119":" Several shells burst among our dugouts this afternoon wounding 5 of our boys. The Turks also shelled the beach heavily killing & wounding many. One of our Battleships tried hard to silence Turkish Battery but did not appear to have made much impression as they continued. Our Howitzer guns then took a hand and must have got a few shots in as they got a lot quieter towards evening. was promoted to full Sergeant to day, dating from","120":" \n","121":" & 25 \n\nTurks artillery doing great damage on the beach both to men & stores, men have received warning not to go bathing untill the evening, but the days are so hot they will risk anything to get a dip – A dust up took place on \"Quinns Post\" last night between the L. Horse & Turks, pretty lively while it lasted.\n","122":" & 27\n\nWeather getting very hot. Turned out at 3 A.M. this morning & marched out on our left front, while carrying out this job another attack was made on \"Quinns Post\" by the Turks & the bullets came singing through the air near our Position, of course we kept our nobs down. On our way back to bivouac a Shrapnell burst about 15 yards overhead but slightly in front of us & luckily no one was hit. Our casualties on Quinns Post were 103. Several shells burst over our dug outs this evening & several of the boys who were preparing their evening meal were hit.\n","123":" & 29\n","124":" Bn Inlying Picquet to day. Heavy fighting going on at Cape Helles. Things fairly quiet on our front. One of our aeroplanes passed over Turkish lines this afternoon & was fired at by the enemy but escaped uninjured. More casualties among our lads on the beach to day. Heavy fireing all along our line this evening, Turks took advantage of the storm that was blowing & tried to rush our trenches, but they lost heavily & had to retire.\n","125":" At daylight this morning it was seen how great the losses of the Turks were as the bodies were pretty thick all over the ground in front of \"Walkers Ridge, some of them got very close to our trenches, others jumped in only to have their heads battered in. We also took some prisoners. A Thunderstorm came up tonight & things were anyhow, The Turks made another mad rush but were repulsed, our casualties were slight.\n\nMore to follow Mother X\n\nHope they don’t weary you, it is just something to pass the time away. Toot-Toot.\n","126":" \n\nFairly quiet all night. A little sniping indulged in at Daylight. A great deal of damage done on the beach , several lighters wrecked by the Storm which passed over last night. Sgt Parsons & myself paid a visit up to the 26th Indian Mountain Battery this afternoon, they are splendid fellows We had a par of good field glasses & could see the Turkish supply columns coming from Maidos to \"Achi-Baba\". While we were in Gun emplacements a 15 pounder shell came tearing overhead & burst quite near the N.Z. Battery but no harm was done, Parsons & I thought it was about time to get under cover. We returned to our bivouac and had a meal of Biscuits & Cheese & a nice dixie of hot Tea, very moreish, but we have to make a little go a long way as water is so very scarce.\n","127":" Stand to Arms at 4 this morning, B.

Everything fairly quiet in Trenches to day. The usual amount of shells deposited on \"Anzac\" beach by Turk artillery, its very strange the enemy opens fire at regular intervals on our landing place. Of course we are getting quite used to it by now, one can hear the screech of the Shells as they pass overhead & then there is a dash for cover of any description, but its hard to tell where they are going to burst. Several lighters & Naval launches have been sunk at various dates. And very often men are killed & wounded. It is a marvel there are not more hit as there are often large numbers working on the beach & so on. The Dressing Station get their share of the shells that come alone and often get smacked while attending to the wounded. \n","129":" Stand to arms at 3 A.M left Bivouac at 4 A.M to do fatigue work on the beach. They are erecting large iron tanks for water supply, which they will pump from water boats. 2 large shells came over this morning from the direction of \"Fort Chanar\" one dropped into the sea very close to one of our Trawlers, which soon moved out of the way. The other dropped on the beach & never burst, it was supposed to be fired from the German Warship \"Golben\" it was an 11 inch Shell. of course we all had to go down at breakfast time & inspect it. On our way back to the Bivouac \"Lonely Liz\" sent over a few shells one of which burst amongst a fatigue party from the 15th & killed 1 man & wounded 11 others. Heavy fighting taking place out on Tasmania Post to night.\n","130":" Out at 4 again this morning to do sapping out on the left. Snipers get to work at us about 10 o.clock but got no one. Returned at midday. The 16th Bn were taken off in lighters this afternoon for a 4 days rest on the Island of Imbros about 11 miles off. Turk artillery soon discovered the movement & rained shells on them, but strange to say no one was hit.. Parsons & myself had a grand view from an old Turkish trench, we could see the flash from their gun when it was fired , & the shells burst over the lighters the bullest lashing the water into foam. When dusk came on Turks cease fire.\n","131":" Things pretty quiet again last night had a decent sleep. Fell in at 9 this morning for inspection by Mjr-Gen Monash, Major Tilney of the 16th Bn took command of our Bn with the rank of Lt. Col. Our old Commander Col Burnage having gone to England wounded. Things got pretty lively this evening. Turk artillery trying hard to get N.Z. Battery out of action, shrapnell bursting overhead a treat. After all the din our casualties numbered only 2 men wounded. Great scarcity of water at present, one gets so thirsty this warm weather. The engineers are sinking new wells over in Monash Gullie, so far they have struck good drinking water. We are allowed 1 pint somedays & a quart others. \n","132":" Usual sniping goes on all night. 13 Bn inlying picquet today. Parsons & myself get permission from O.C. to go for a dip, which is very acceptable after so much heat & dust. H.M.S Humber bombards Turk Battery out towards \"Lone Pine\" this afternoon. Turks getting very active on our lefty no doubt preparing for another wild charge. Well let em all come we are quite ready for them. Sending rockets up to night to illuminate the space between enemys trenches & our own to guard against Turkish surprise attack.\n","133":" On the move at 4 this morning for fatigue work on the beach, We had only been down about 20 minutes when over came a shell & burst pretty high in the air, but 4 of our boys were wounded. We returned to bivouac about 10 A.M. About midday Turks train their guns on N.Z. Battery again, smashing a wheel of one of them. Of course our dug-outs being in rear of them we often get fragments of shell & showers of earth & stones. Got pretty quiet again until after 6 o,clock when they got noise,s in the head and they started a lively artillery duel & kept going for over an hour finishing up the Chorus with a merry tune on the machine guns. Afterwards quietness reigned supreme. \n","134":" Very quiet night, took advantage and had a splendid snore.","135":" Battn inlying Picquet to day. Turned out very hot and dusty. 2nd Division under General Godley makeing preparations out on the left for new offensive movement. Turks appear to have got noises in their heads tonight as they kept up a pretty heavy machine gun fire. Of course our guns reply occasionally to keep them company. \n\nStand to arms at 3.10 this morning. Fireing became very brisk along the whole front expecting an attack from the enemy but after waiting to accomadate him it never came off. Our 15th Reinfts arrived this morning with the exception of 8 men who were wounded coming ashore. Fierce fighting between our Warships and Forts at Kilid- Bahr this afternoon. H.M.S Lord Nelson done some splendid shooting. Turks anti-aircraft guns try hard to bring one of our aeroplanes down this evening but failed. There are great numbers of dead Turks lying in front of our lines, stench from them very bad. Things much quieter to night. Both sides must have wasted an enormous amount of ammunition today.\n","136":" Left Bivouac at midnight to go road marking out on the left returned at 4 this morning 14th Battn relieving us. Things getting joyful on Walkers Ridge again, Bombs freely used by the enemy but with small success. Kilid-Bahr again Bombarded by Warships this afternoon. Things getting quite lively across the whole front towards dusk, looks as though there will be something doing. They appear to be having a ding-dong go down at Seddul-Bahr judging by the roar of cannon.\n","137":" Roused out at 3 this morning expecting to make an attack on enemy trenches, the 6th Battn Infantry & 6th L.H. Regt made a bayonet charge on our right & captured a trench. They had 11 killed & 23 wounded. We heard the British forces in the South had done well, they get it pretty rough down there at times. Hurrah, get letters from home. We formed our new bomb party to day expecting to do great things. They call us the \"Suicide Club\".\n","138":" Marched down to beach again this morning for more fatigue work, but didnt remain long as the Turks Artillery got to work on us, \nseveral\n 5 of our lads hit. Parsons & myself got clear again. Our 6th Reinfts arrived this morning, also some of our lads who went away early in the Campaign with wounds and are now fit again. Turks shell beach again this evening doing little damage\n","139":" 13th Battn Inlying Picquet again to day. Turks blew one of our trenches up this morning at \"Courtney Post\" injuring a great many.

Turk guns again busy, they pour a great many shells into our Batteries but little damage done. Aeroplanes report Turks doing a lot of sapping out on our left. Down for a dip this afternoon must have been hundreds in the water when over came a couple of shells and burst high in the air some of the lads make a dash for the shore while others remain paddling about, there were three men wounded. Although dangerous it has its humorous side. Lessons in Bomb Throwing this evening.\n","141":" Had a good nights rest. Turks shelling our Supply Base hevily this morning. HMS Humber exchanged shots with Turkish Field Battery out towards \"Lone Pine\" position but seem unable to silence them. The Turks have one gun out there which our boys have named \"Beachy Bill\" and another on our left near \"Anafarta\" which they call \"Lonely Liz\" they cause no end of trouble to us. The boys in fireing line get busy this evening with their machine guns, So does the Turk sending showers of bullets overhead \nsighing like wind\n they fairly whistle. \n","142":" \n\n13th Battn Inlying Picquet to day. Very quiet along the whole front this morning. Turned out another very hot and dusty day. Water still very scarce. About 6 oclock this evening the din broke out again, especially on our right were they had many casualties. Another fight raging down at \"Seddul-Bahr\". Two more 6 inch Howitzer Batteries brought ashore at \"Anzac\" tonight, and covered with bushes so that enemy aeroplanes cannot detect them. \nTurk artillery have a go at another of our aeroplanes this\n","143":" Fairly quiet all night. Stand to Arms at 4 this morning, but nothing doing. Church Parade held this morning, good attendance. Colonel Rae & Capt Gillies conduct service. The lesson was in reference to St Paul crossing from Asia to Greece & introducing Christianity to Europe for the first time, very interesting knowing we are in the vicinity of where these happenings took place. Turks again shell the Base this afternoon doing a fair amount of damage, and wounding 5 men. It has been very hot to day, men going around in knickers, Hat, and boots, \n","144":" Our Batteries open first on Turkish Position early this morning doing damage to their trenches.

Had a good feed on our return consisting of Biscuits, singed bacon and Bully Beef warmed up to , to say nothing of half a tin of Deakins Apricot jam, the stuff that does more damage than half the shells fired on Peninsula. However what dont fatten will fill.\n","146":" Inlying picquet to day. 3 of our Warships hard at it down at Cape Hellas this morning Turks reply to their fire and some of their shells go pretty close. Our Howitzer’s hurl a few shells at Turk trenches this evening just to let em know we have a few rounds left I suppose. Turk Artillery also waste lots of ammunition fireing at one of our aeroplanes this evening. One of our lads killed by falling empty shell case.\n","147":" Stand to arms at 3 oclock this morning untill 5.30. After a feed a party of us went down for a dip out near no 2 outpost, after about a dozen of us were splashing about like a lot of youngsters, the Turk snipers opened fire on us and then there was some joy getting to the shore, it seemed such a long way off, but they only hit one man in the arm after all sniping, needless to say we did not venture in again that day. Expecting an attack to night, stood to arms at 11P.M and dispersed at midnight nothing doing.\n","148":" Another alarm at 1 oclock this morning but false one. So lay down with all equipment on for a doze again. But roused again at 1.30 and stood to arms until daylight, waiting for Turks to Box-on. Our Howitzer,s carry out usual programme bombarding enemy trenches. Turk gunners reply and do some good shooting. Warships stir them up with a few high explosives now and then, for old times sake.\n","149":" Stand to arms at 1 oclock this morning until 4 A.M. but the wily Turks have not made the long expected charge as yet. Enemy guns shell beach \nhevily\n again this morning doing a lot of damage to stores. Sounds of heavy fireing going on out towards \"Krithia\". Everything pretty quiet on our left. Retire early to night for a good rest.\n","150":" Out again at 1 oclock this morning as Turks were reported comeing on towards our trenches, so every man on the alert. But the Turks came at our troops near \"Walkers Ridge\" and got a warm reception leaving many dead on the field. Our losses were 28 killed and wounded. They carry out their usual programme and shell the Base and landing stage, several reported to have been wounded. They can hardly miss hitting someone as there are allways such a large number of men doing duty on the beach.\n","151":" Stand to arms at 3 this morning untill daylight. Turk snipers shot several of our lads while bathing this morning. The usual artillery compliments paid by both sides. 4 New Zealanders shot down by machine gun fire while erecting barb wire defences on our left.

The dead were taken down and buried in cemetry at \"Hells spit\" the wounded removed to dressing station. \n","154":" Had a good spell all night and was properly in need of it. Everything pretty quiet along our front this morning. Sgt Parsons beginning to break down in health, but insists in remaining with the boys. One of our aeroplanes flew over enemy lines & dropped bombs this afternoon and had no sooner retired when a German Aeroplane came over our lines and dropped 2 bombs one fell into the sea and the other killed 3 mules.

Parsons & myself took a tour round \"Walkers Ridge\" after breakfast had a good pair of glass,s & could see Turks gunners working their 10 Pounder gun against our trenches at \"Quinns Post\", Hard to distinguish enemy trenches from our own now, as they are so jumbled up. Especially at \"Popes Hill\" where it is a mass of trenches. We witnessed a grand but deadly sight this evening on our right & away down South were the Turks attacked our lines. The air was alive with bursting shells of all calibre,s, the rattle of musketry was deafening. Got quiet again after dark.\n","157":"\n\nHeavy fighting took place all night on our right the","158":" & 12th Battn of the","159":" Brigade having done good work capturing 2 lines of enemy trenches after stubborn resistance.

The 6th Reinforcement from Egypt this morning and were posted to various Company,s. Received orders to be ready to move off at minutes notice, all the boys anxious for a bit of hurry-up. Turned out a very warm day and awfully dusty, with very small supply of water to quench ones thirst. Turks get noises in the head to night and fire wildly for about 20 minutes, doing very little damage.\n\n3) A quiet night spent. Great preparations still being made by all hands for the expected advance. Water supply still very poor. Met Lieut Gould of the","160":" Battn in \"Shrapnell Gully\" this afternoon, he was with our Company at Liverpool for a time. Great quantity of Ammunition and other stores including large tins of water which were brought from Egypt for the Troops. Also many new Troops. Turks send over a few shells from their 75 cm gun among our bivouacs but luckily no-one was hit. Great din along the whole front to night.\n\n4) 4,000 Imperial Troops came ashore through the night, Turks put a few shells over to welcome them. German aeroplane came over our trenches this morning and dropped 4 bombs which fell with a deafening crash but no material damage. A \"Monitor\" shelled Turkish Field Bayteries on our right near \"Krithia\". Turks put several shells over our Bivouac this afternoon killing 2 New Zealanders and wounding one of the 13th. Brisk rifle fire at intervals throughout the night.\n","161":" Stand to arms at 4 A.M. this morning. Making ready for the great offensive. More Imperial Troops came ashore last night. One Battln each from the Cheshire Regt and Worcester Regt. Spent the afternoon in making bags for Bomb carriers 4 men from each Coy in Bomb party. Turks getting very troublesome with their Artillery they put one of the New Zealand Batteries guns out of Action and killed 2 gunners this afternoon near \"Walkers Ridge\". They also sent a few over our \"Bivouac’ from their 75cm guns and send showers of stones and dit down on the boys Dug-outs.\n","162":" Great activity in our lines to day putting final touches to everything, such as sewing our white arm bands on to Tunic,s and also on the back, so as to distinguish our own men in case of a mix up to night. Water bottles are filled and enough rations for 48 hours. The 4th Brigade addressed by Brig-General Monash this afternoon when we had our portion of the programme explained to us. The 29th Indian Brigade came ashore last night and were hidden away in dug-outs in case enemy aeroplanes should hover over position and see new troops and raise the alarm, up till the present everything has gone off well. About 5P.M our Howitzer,s of which we have quite a large number, although of a very old pattern, started a heavy Bombardment of the Turkish position right along the whole front And what a din. Our boys received orders not to fire a shot in the advance, everything was to be done with the bayonet. Our Brigade moved quietly out after dark to wards No. 3 Outpost, where we were to support the New Zealanders in the assault on the Foot-hills at \"Taylors Gap\" About 9P.M the assault commenced in earnest the N.Z,s and \"Maori,s\" led off with our Brigade in Support, The Turks were caught napping and the majority went off at the double, some hung on and fought desperately but were either killed or taken prisoners, as we were to strong in numbers for them, there were several hand-to-hand combats with the Turks and old B. Coy. The little hill above \"Taylors Gap\" was strewn with dead and badly wounded whose cries for Water Water were pitiful. We had received orders before the assault that men wounded in the abdomen were not to be given water as it would do them more harm than good. Our Coy lost many men about this spot, young Dawson \"Sutton\" Robertson & Walker and several other chaps that came away in the 2nd Reinforcements with me were killed or wounded. Away we went tumbling over rocks and bushes in the dark and yelling out any old thing to make a noise, wherever we saw a rifle spit we would make for it and so on in the hurly-burly \n\nAbout 11 o,clock Lieut Perry was struck in the shoulder and Lieut Marks was wounded and had to retire. Lieut Pulling was shot dead. We could hear the Turk artillery getting their guns away in the dark, but unfortunately we were to late to make a capture.\n\nWhat a night, we could hear the NZ,s yelling away on our right as they made their way up to \"Chunak Bair\", we came upon some barb-wire entanglements but after battering and tearing away for a time we got through, and went on with Capt Salier. \n","163":" The battle raged fast and furious all night. Our boys were driveing the Turks from one ridge to another inflicting loss,s and in many cases makeing prisoners, we also had many casualties due to Turkish snipers being hidden in tree tops. The New Zealanders, Gurkhas, and several Battlns of Imperial troops reached our main objective \"Hill 971\" Chunak Bair and terrible fighting took place, further on our left our Brigade supported by the Wiltshire Regt and a Battln of the Kings Own Light Infantry were putting in good work, but arrived just to late to capture a Battery of enemy Guns which were splendidly concealed in an Olive grove, some of our Company were quite close and could hear the Turks shouting out orders and whipping their horses up, in their efforts to save their guns, they left many rounds of big Gun ammunition behind (The famous \"Lonely Liz\" was one of the guns lost.) We went well out scraping all the way untill meeting superior numbers when we dug in and held on. \n\nWe were greatly surprised when we saw Warships and Transports in Suvla Bay as we never heard they intended makeing another landing and what a \"mess\" it was, it being daylight when the movement commenced, with the result that the Turk Artillery played havoc among them as they advanced across open fields, we could see them falling in dozens. We held 3 wells for a time but had to leave. \n","164":" Battle still going strong, Warships shelling \"Hill 971\" and the W. Hills in our front all night, the Imperial Troops gain a footing on the \"Chocolate Hills\" after some stiff fighting, but unable to connect up with our line. At daybreak our Brigade was ordered to attack \"Hill 60. The","165":" – 15th and 16th supported by the","166":" went forward in grand style but soon came under heavy Machine gun and rifle fire which checked our progress, men took what little cover there was and held on for a little more than an hour. Several small parties of our boys were cut of and either killed or made prisoners. The Turks were being strongly reinforced and we retired to our old position, leaveing many of our gallant lads dead on the Field, our retirement was covered by our machine guns. We started right away to consolidate our position and prepare for any attack the enemy might deliver. The Turks must have brought up thousands of Troops on \"Hill 971 as they fairly swarmed over the flat top when they attacked our troops, we could see the big naval shells bursting among them which must have killed hundreds. The dead were piled up in places, our loss,es were very heavy also, and the :Hill Top was lost, the Turks fought bravely as did the New Zealanders who hung to their position right through.\n\nTroops badly in need of water. \n\n9th Fighting continues all night, first in favour of one then the other. In several places the British gained a position and held on. The Turkish fighters very troublesome, picking off many men,\n\nAbout 7.A.M. a force of about 200 Turks jumped from their trenches and attacked us on \"Saliers Post\" we were about 130 strong and the boys were very fatigued after the last few days hard work, but every man sprang to it, grabbed his rifle and got to them, the range being about 200 yards only, it was almost impossible to miss hitting someone. As the Turks left their trenches and ran down the opposite slop to attack us led by a big German Officer, we let them have it properly. They went over like \"skittles\", of course the German got more than one bullet. More than half the attackers must have fell, a few got close to our trenches 3 of them were just about to Bomb our Machine Gun when they were shot. Their wounded that were able crept back to their own lines, our casualties were slight 4 of our chaps being wounded. They came at us again after dark but our bombs being directed well kept them off, but our loss,es were heavier They attacked the K.O.S.B on our right and were repulsed.\n\n10th Turks made an attack at daybreak along our front, but were repulsed, we lost many men. We were relieved at 6 A.M. by A and D Coy,s were only out of the trenches about an hour when we were hurried back again, as Turks were massing on our left in large numbers. The Wilts Regt on our left command approaches to Water Wells. About midday things got very lively on our right which is held by K.O.S.B Regt, supported by 15th Battln. The boys are properly worn out with fatigue. Water very scarce, what little one did get was like mud, Pitifull sights to see around the water holes in the \"Dere\" were scores of soldiers hang around almost famished.\n\nOur cruisers open fire on Turkish reinforcements on \"Hill 971 and smash them up properly. The slopes covered with dead and wounded.\n\n11th. Everybody very weary. 13th Battln ranks very thin. We are haveing few hours out of Firing line will now have a sleep. Woke after 5 hours sound sleep feeling very refreshed. A wash quite out of the question, so walk about covered with dust as usual. Drinking water hard to procure (Oh, to be among good water again.) The Battle still going strong on 971 and the \"Chocolate Hills. The Turks go for the \"Imperial Troops like one thing. They are mostly lads of the new army and are brand new at roughing it, but will soon be broken in. We go into fireing line at 9P.M relieving A and D Company. Capt. Salier in command of B. and C. Coys with Lieuts Brierly and Boccard.\n\n12th The lads working hard all night strengthening our position against attack, The usual snipeing indulged in at daybreak, time to catch the Turks carrying water to their trenches. Turkish artillery fire a few shrapnell shells over our position this morning, I was in the act of putting a clip of cartridges into the magazine of rifle, when a bullet went clean through – Of course had to get another magazine form damaged rifle. The S.W.B.s Regt did some good work on our left this evening. Turk artillery from \"Anafarta\" fired on one of our warships that came rather close inshore and drove her off. They also shelled a mule train bringing our supplies from the beach, there was a great slaughter among men and animals, also stretcher-bearers and wounded who were making their way towards the dressing station were blown to atoms. I passed by on my way after water late in the afternoon, the sights were indescribable. Several parties out to night burying the dead.\n\n13th Heavy artillery duel on this morning. Tommies dropping out of ranks for want of water. Turkish snipers picking our men off when going for water. Fighting still goes on all along the line, great carnage on 971 – large numbers of dead Turks and some of our own lads lying in front of our own lines, stench very sickening. Went into fireing line at 7.30P.M. (received letter from home very cheering.) everything pretty quiet until about midnight when they got real joyfull.\n","167":" Snipers busy early this morning enfilading our trenches. Turned out another very warm day. Water supply slowly improving. Turks shelled our bivouac for over 2 hours this afternoon killing several and wounding others. More Troops being landed at Suvla Bay the enemy being pressed back in some places. A great many of our lads being struck down with sickness are being taken to \"Anzac\". After dark I crept out over the parapet and recovered 2 Paybooks and other belongings from two of our dead comrades who fell in the advance. Snipers \"possies\" pretty close to our firing line, got to be very cautious.\n\n15th Warships continue to shell 971, and Turkish Field batteries at \"Anafarta\". Several of our lads wounded earlier in the campaign returned to Battln to day. Sick list growing daily. Troops preparing for another dash at 971. Heard this morning that our 1st Division made an attack on \"Lone Pine\" to the right of \"Anzac\" and were successful, but lost very heavily. Capt A. Snow a splendid officer of the 1st Battln who had previously won the Military Cross was recommended for the CV.C. He died from wounds. Several of us run a risk this afternoon and went for a dip to get some of the dirt off, Turks got a Machine Gun on to us and we were off in a twinkling all escaped unhurt. Went into trenches at 7.P.M relieving D. Coy. \n","168":" Fairly quiet night all along the line. Heavy fireing down at Cape Hellas, heard they were making another attack on \"Achi-Baba\". Turkish Artillery try to bring down naval observation balloon at Suvla Bay but again fail. Our Howitzers shell enemys trenches on our front this afternoon. More fighting out towards Salt lake, Turks appear to have upper hand holding all important positions. 3 of our lads wounded this afternoon. Some of the","169":" Battln sunk a well near Olive grove and struck good water.\n","170":" Everything much quieter last night. Turk snipers doing lots of damage again, had 2 of my section both Brothers, killed early just after daybreak (\"Darky\" & Harry Rice\") fine brave fellows. Bill Curtis was shot through the jaw while having a nap, and Cpl Kay shot through the right shoulder, taken to dressing station. Very difficult job getting killed and wounded out of firing line, owing to narrowness. A German aeroplane flew over our trenches this afternoon and dropped 2 bomb,s and lots of steel darts, but all fell in front of our lines. One of our \"Planes\" took after the \"Taube\" which went off at a great speed, easily escaping from our machine. Sickness claiming many of our lads. \n","171":" Plenty of hurry-up on our left early this morning. Turk Artillery got busy early, must have received fresh supplies of Gun ammunition. Snipers getting more troublesome than ever, Some shrapnell shells burst over bivouac about midday, while the boys were enjoying tinned dog and Biscuits, 4 were killed 1 badly wounded. Turks discover were our new water wells are, and when a crowd gather for water, they get their Machine Gun to work and then there,s a scramble.\n","172":" Fairly quiet last night had a grand snore. About 7 this morning some wild cheering took place on our right, we heard afterwards that the British Troops had made a charge near \"Flat-Top\" and carried a position. We had a stiff fall of rain this morning and were soon wet through, we have not yet received our overcoats or blankets which we left at \"Anzac\". the night of the advance. Turkish Field Guns doing some good shooting, against out Howitzer Battery neat No.3. outpost Sgt Parsons and myself had a glorious feed to night, haveing \"borrowed\" some honey from empty Farm house.\n\n20th Very cold last night after the rain. A little sniping going on this morning otherwise pretty quiet. About midday Turkish Artillery got busy again hurling shells about, one of our Cruisers done good shooting, one of her shells crashed into Turks gun pit, putting gun and most of the gunners out of action. Our forces are well supplied with aircraft no fewer than 5 were up this afternoon observing, The Turks got to work at them with anti-aircraft guns but did no damage. Shells look pretty bursting high in air great danger from falling empty cases.\n\n21st Fairly quiet night, Turks made attack at daylight on S.W.Bs trenches on our left but were beaten back. All prepareing for another dash, our Howitzers start heavy bombardment of enemy trenches about 5P.M. the boys waiting ready for charge. Tough job on hand, about 6 o,clock we lept over the parapets and dashed down the slopes and on towards the Turks trenches , many of our boys were knocked over getting out of our trenches, others killed & wounded going forward. The Turks had several machine guns playing on us besides rifle fire. Things were very warm, an 8 inch shell burst and set fire to scrub, many of our wounded were burnt to death. We reached our objective and captured part but lost heavily. Lieuts Carter & Thompson wounded. We consolidated position through the night.\n\n22nd Turks try to drive us out of newly won \"possy\" but fail, we were reinforced by 100 men before daylight the ground we charged over littered with our dead and many wounded. Warships and Howitzers again bombard enemy trenches this afternoon, expecting to make another attack this evening, hope we have better success. Major Herring reported our Battln to weak to make assault, we numbered only 160 men. Remained on defensive all night.\n\n23rd Turks made attack on our position at 2.A.M. this morning, but met with a very warm reception and were obliged to retire, at daylight there were many dead Turks lying in front of our Trenches. We were relieved by 2 Coys of the 16th Battln at 8.A.M. this morning, and after working our way back, at times on hands & knees through prickly scrub and stonking bodies of Turks we reached our Bivouac about 400 yards in rear of fireing line. After haveing a good fill of Beef & Biscuits we curled up for a much needed sleep.\n\n24th) Wide awake again at 5.A.M. this morning after a beautifull sleep and dreams of \"Home Sweet Home\". Things got really lively on our left this morning when the 18th Battln 5th Brigade which landed a few days ago, and were under fire for first time made a great charge, but when things appeared to be going well they were ordered to retire. And it was then that the Turks machine guns cut them up. They lost many men. We had 2 Companies of the 17th Battln attached to us, our own strength is about 320 men, our ranks have been thinned out since the 6th. Turkish Artillery \"whacking\" plenty of shells into our bivouac this afternoon but do no damage, everybody being well under cover.\n\n25) Had another good nights rest. Our Howitzer guns do some good shooting this morning, dropping high explosives into enemy trenches and shifting things generaly at the same time. (Received news from Home Sweet Home). Lieut Boccard and myself went over to our old trenches on \"Saliers Post\" this afternoon to find most suitable place for instructing bomb throwers from the 17th & 18th Battlns. On our way back Turkish snipers opened fire on us and you should have seen us trying to break all sprinting records, we had not very far to go, but before we were far across Lieut Boccard staggered, and fell having been shot in the stomach lost no time in getting him into a place of safety and shouted for stretcher bearers who are always ready to do their duty and Dr Purvey who was quickly on the scene, soon dressed the wound and hurried him off to \"Anzac\" Dr says it was very bad wound but there was a chance of recovery.\n\n26) Stand to arms at 4 A.M. this morning, but nothing doing. Spent the rest of the morning giving instruction in Bomb Throwing to 17th & 18th Battln and my own party. The lads shaped very well. Turk artillery indulge in a little shooting this afternoon and drop several close to water wells. Rough weather coming up from Sou-west, guess we are in for a wet night. Got busy and rigged up water-proofs for cover.\n\n27th) Some heavy showers fell last night making things very uncomfortable. Preparations being made this morning for another advance. Heavy Bombardment from our Warships and land Batteries start about 4.30 this afternoon and lasted for over an hour, then we went mad climbed over the parapets and down the slope in front of our trenches, but the Turks were quite ready for us and our Coy was cut up badly before we had gone 100 yards, but we scrambled on another 50 yards and got into dead ground and dodged the bullets for a time. Then after a blow we were off again, but the Turks machine guns got busy and it was deemed best to retire to our old position. Our casualties were very heavy Lieut,s Brierly & Gardner were both badly wounded, several of our lads who were left wounded managed to crawl back after night fall, and others were carried back by their comrades. So once again we failed to dislodge the tough old Turk.\n\n28th) Pretty brisk rifle fire kept up by both sides all night, at day-break there was a proper mix-up, Turks and our lads at pretty close quarters. Many Turkish Infantry show great recklessness to get a shot in, some even standing on the Parapets of their trenches and blazing away at the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, then our chance came for a little sniping and one could hardly miss them they presented such targets. The Turks soon discovered where the sniping came from and sent a few shots our way, we lost no time in ducking our heads, but poor old Whelan got one in the chest, just gave a groan & fell, we took him to the rear of the fireing line and Cpl Shields had the top of his head blown right off. Turkish Artillery shell our trenches this afternoon killing 3 men and wounding 5 others. We have very little cover at present from their shell fire as they can almost enfilade our fire trench. We were relieved about midnight by the 16th Battln. All our boys done up need a good rest.\n\n29th) Stand to arms at 5 A.M. this morning. Turkish Artillery send a few shells among the 16th &","173":" Battln at \"Herring Post\" about breakfast time, killing one man and wounding 6 others. German aeroplane came over our trenches at midday and dropped 3 Bombs which all fell outside our lines. 2 Coys of New Zealanders and the","174":" Light Horse made an attack on the Turk trenches on our left and drove them from their first line after a hard scrap, they had plenty of Bomb fighting at close quarters, both sides suffered many casualties.\n","175":" Stand to arms at 4A.M. this morning. Usual sniping indulged in at day-break, I was holding a periscope up trying to find the exact position of a sniper who had been very troublesome to us the last few mornings. Had the periscope up only a few seconds when \"crash, a bullet went clean through, smashing the mirror, which rattled down the tube and peppered my face, they are fine shots without a doubt. Giving instructions on Bomb Throwing and Fuse timing to throwers of A.B.C. & D. Coys after breakfast Turk artillery again busy shelling \"Herring Post at midday Our Aeroplanes trying to locate position of enemy guns which are apparently well concealed.\n","176":" Stand to arms again at 3 this morning but nothing sensational takes place. 8 men and myself of the 13th Battln journeyed to \"Anzac Bomb Factory for instruction in new Bombs recently arrived from England. We made most of the trip and had a good swim while on the beach. Had just reached the entrance of the big Sap on our way back when a shell from Turk Artillery dropped among a stack of Tinned meat (Boxes) which was scattered in all directions, one man was killed, having the side of his head smashed with a piece of shell. Got back again to our lines about 5 oclock, the","177":" were relieved by the Essex Regt to night and we moved off towards Flat-Top near \"Suri-Bahr, most of us got into our new position about 10 o,clock, but one of our Companys got bushed and never arrived untill 2 in the morning. \n","178":"\n\nSpent a very cold night in the trenches. We are bivouaced near the Worcester Regt, we are to releive them, they have lost very heavily since","179":" About 3P.M we were on the move again scrambling through bushes & climbing hills to occupy our new position known as \"Durrants Post\" near \"Hill 971\". We anchor at last after a weary march as the majority of the lads are done to a turn. We got straight to work to make our position stronger as the defences were very weak when we went into them. It is evidently a dangerous spot this judging by the number of graves about. The part of the Defences allotted to the 15th are quite close to \"Flat-Top\".\n\n(2) Spent the night in trenches nothing sensational took place. About 8 o,clock this morning a ding-dong scrap takes place over at our old position at \"Herring Post\" now occupied by the Essex Regt. We got a good view of the fight as we are a fair height above sea level. Turk artillery put many shells among them. They also bombard Suvla Bay Camp this afternoon. Major Herring called for volunteers for Patrol work for to night Privates Roscoe, Young, Ryan & myself were sent out just after dusk & made our way cautiously towards Turkish trenches, often stumbling over the dead body of a Turkish or English Soldier who had fallen a few days back in the Big Battle, We reached the bottom of the \"Dere\" without being spotted & after remaining there for a time we could hear a babble of voices coming our way & we counted 9 Turks who passed within 6 yards of our \"Possey\" but we had orders not to fire a shot unless attacked, so after finding out one or two items we returned to our own lines about midnight & made my report to C.O who seemed quite satisfied with our investigations.\n","180":" Things fairly quiet all night. Turks indulge in a little artillery fire this morning, damage insignificant. City of London Regt take up position on our left. Our Cruisers in Suvla bay send a few shells into Turkish position this afternoon for old times sake. Pte Young & myself out on Patrol work again to night, returning to our lines about midnight. Spring a surprise on some Tommies who had been attached to our Battln by getting into firing line without being challenged. The scene that followed was very funny, although risky. Things pretty lively on \"Walkers Ridge\" tonight. \n","181":" Firing continued all night on our right. Turk Artillery try hard for Indian Mountain battery this morning, but their shooting was very eratic. The \"Monitors drop a few \"pills\" into enemy trenches this afternoon sending up clouds of earth & stones. A party of 20 from 3 Coy went for a dip this evening a great treat. Things get a bit lively towards midnight.\n","182":" (Sabbath) Everything very quiet this morning. Imperial Troops hold church service down in the Olive grove, the singing sounds very sweet it carries ones memories back to more pleasant surroundings. Spent afternoon writing letters. Went into fireing line at 4P.M. Had a little Bomb practice at the Turks expense to night. This Sunday has been an exception we generally have some scrapping weekends.\n","183":" Had a good nights rest. Great Artillery duel on this morning Warships takeing part, a great din. There appears to be great activity out towards Suvla Bay. We are having beautiful weather this last few days. But \"Oh the Flies\" Flies\" they are nearly maddening. Great wonder is that there has not been more cases of serious illness among our Troops. I took another Patrol out towards enemy trenches about 7.30P.M and returned at midnight nothing of a sensational character took place. Pretty risky job.\n","184":" Usual artillery activity goes on this morning, doing more or less damage ion either side. Some of our Battleships using their big 12 inch Guns, there is an awful thud when they fire. B. & C. Coy came out of trenches at 4P.M. being relieved by A. & D. Coys. Things very quiet all night.\n","185":" Artillery haveing another great Box-on this morning. Our boys out again on fatigue work, majority of men very weak. Out on Patrol work again to night with a party of 12 men also Major Johnson of the Essex Regt & Lt Gardiner of our own Coy, after doing the usual creeping about among the bushes like youngsters playing hide & seek, we returned to fireing line at 11P.M.\n","186":" Artillery still booming, must have been tons of iron hurled about these last few days. 2 Battln of the","187":" Bgde of Australians came up near our position this afternoon looking in splendid nick, haveing just arrived from Egypt. Hope it is not long before we are looking & feeling as well as them again. Had another journey down to \"Anzac\" this afternoon for instruction in new Bombs that have recently arrived from England, took me all my time to crawl down & back again as I am feeling dead weak, have been suffering with Dysentery these last few days.\n","188":" Everything quiet all night. Early this morning the 27 & 28th Battln came and \n\nreleived us. Thank God we are off for a spell at last. The remnants of the old","189":" Bgde left \"Durrants Post\" about 6 o,clock for \"Anzac Cove\" and after going at a snails pace reached there at 11P.M and stretched out on the beach for a couple of hours sleep.\n","190":" Just before daylight we went off in lighters to S.S. Abbassia and left \"Anzac\" for Lemnos Island arriving there about 10 this morning. I never thought it would be my good fortune to see Lemnos again, However here we are. We came ashore at midday & made our way out to the rest camp they had \"partly\" established for us. There was an abundance of good food, but I was to washed out to go it (Something wrong as I am pretty good on the tooth.)\n","191":" There was great shortage of tents for the number of men that came so many had to sleep out, your humble included, Just before daylight a storm came on & rain fell in torrents and it was not long before everything was wet through, water poured down the slopes a treat.

And they made us quite at home. Packed up same night & went to Scotland arriving there next morning. I travelled by the London Nor Western Railway & I can assure you they travel some. I stayed at Mr J.M.Lauder,s residence in East London St. in the heart of the City. They are very nice people. The son Alex came from the Dardanelles in the same Hospital ship as myself. Another son is also home from the front having been wounded. And of course we go sightseeing together & I can assure you there are some fine sights right here in Old Edinburgh, it is still more interesting to me knowing my dad came from these parts years ago. While here I have visited Edinburgh Castle twice, Holyrood Place & Queen Marys, Famous Bath, Calton Hill with its relics of bygone days, Nelson Monument, also the unfinished Waterloo monument, , one can also get a splendid view of the City from this Hill. Paid a visit to Robert Burns memorial in Regent Rd & the Municipal Museum where John Knoxs hat & other articles the famous reformer wore are kept. Visited Lady Stairs House & The Heart of Midlothian. John Knox House & burial Place in the Royal Mile. Also the old Scottish Parliament Houses, & the Grass Markets. The Murry House where the union between England & Scotland was signed.

Mr Lauder tells me it is very quiet here this year on account of the War, it must be real lively when the war is off. Well we returned home & had a splendid supper laid out & we sat down & gave it nothing. \n\nMr Luke an elder from the church, also Mr Sinclair were present & we spent a couple of hours yearning & so forth, & after wishing each other the best of luck & good fortune & singing \"Auld lang Syne\" & Wishing success to our Army & Navy & so on, also wishing that I am spared to be home with my loved ones by next \"Hogmaney\" It is a great time among the Scotch folk, we retired to bed about 4 in the morning.\n","241":"\n\nReported to headquarters at Horseferry road this afternoon. I came back by the East Coast Railway through Newcastle & York. About 30 of our lads myself included left London for our base in Weymouth on the South Coast about 5P.M & arrived there at 10P.M & marched out to camp which is situated about 2½ miles form the town. I met some of the old","242":" here.\n","243":"\n\nMedical Parade this morning & passed fit as a fiddle & so on. Haveing stormy weather around these parts. They have large Huts erected here to accomadate the Troops, of whom there must be 3,000 all waiting to be drafted away to Egypt. And there is another Camp at Westham were the unfit for further service are camped they are also waiting for a boat to Australia. Daily routine, Parade at 9A.M. go for a light march along Chickerill Road & back, sometimes they march to Weymouth & so on, Duties are very light, we get a guard at intervals, it is just a matter of eat, drink & sleep & a bloke can snore these cold nights.\n","244":" Issued with new equipment, looks like business again\n","245":" Another of our lads taken out of the Harbour drowned, this makes the fourth since I have been in Weymouth, they say their is foul work being done, The local Regt of Dorsets & our boys often mix it.\n","246":" Inspection of Troops & Camp by Mjr General Johnson who is in command of Weymouth Military District.\n","247":" Australia day & a fine day as regards the weather. Our boys to the number of 2000 or more, were marched into Weymouth given a concert in the Jubilee Hall. It was a great turn out.\n","248":" All hands down at the rifle range this morning doing a little shooting, just to get their hand & eye in.\n","249":" Beautiful Day, easily the best since my stay in England.

A Submarine Guard mounted, to keep an eye open for the tin fish.\n","253":" Very rough. Ship doing all kinds of acrobatic feats\n","254":" Sea much calmer. Naval men have a few shots out of 4.7 gun which is mounted aft in case of a Submarine attack. Shooting not too good, might hit something if they had a dish of rice.\n","255":" Fine weather. Passed a British Cruiser steaming west this evening. Also a large Transport escorted by a light Cruiser making towards Alexandria. Many Trawlers doing patrol work around these parts.\n","256":" Arrived at Alexandria at 7P.M this morning & anchored inside breakwater near Ras-el-Tin Light-House. A great many vessels in port mostly Troopships & Hospital ships. The Imperial disembarked at midday & marched to Mustapha Pacha Barracks.

More to follow - DiddieX\n","263":"\n\nThe","264":" Brigade inspected by General Cox our Divisional Commander & Mjr-General Godley, Our Brigade complimented by the General on its smart appearance \"some swank to be sure\"\n","265":" Anzac day. Holiday granted to all Troops in the vicinity of the Canal. There was a great gathering on the Canal and the Sports were a great success. Some of the boys made boats out of Canvas & other material that was lying about & some very humorous sceanes were witnessed. We had distinguished persons as spectators such as his Royal Nibs the Prince of Wales & so on. He holds the rank of Capt and is attached to General Murrays staff. All the boys spent a great day. To top it up, every man received a bottle of Lemonade to wash the desert sand out of his neck, needless to say it hardly wet were it went. \n","266":" We received news of Turkish raid in \"Kantara\" a town a few miles from here in a Northerly direction. It appears the Turks caught the British napping and after a short scrap the Turks captured over 200 Soldiers & about 300 Camels & 150 Horses – some loss to us. Almost sure to be an enquiry held the rumour flying around is to the effect that they had no Guards or Sentries posted (Just like the British to always underestimate their enemies.) Also received news of an action near the \"Wells\" on our east front.\n","267":"\n\nReceived news of General Towshend,s surrender of Kut-el-Amara after defending that town for over 5 months, which certainly was a great work, owing to climatic conditions, & serious sickness that broke out among his Garrison which by the time of his surrender must have been reduced to small numbers. On 2 occasions attempts were made to relievehim & were beaten back by the Turks.\n","268":" D. Coy on Out Post Duty to night.\n","269":" Eddie May’s Birthday\n","270":" The whole of the","271":" Brigade marched out and occupied our first line Trenches as Aeroplane came in & reported small Turkish Force in vicinity. Our Battn the 45th are at Post K.5.D. about 9 miles east of Suez Canal. The march out from railhead was pretty heavy to so much drift sand, & the heat of the day. Of course as is usual there was a great shortage of water.\n","272":" Stand to arms at 3A.M this morning, Building barbed wire entanglements & emptying sand out of the trenches. The weather to day has been very warm. And water scarce. Done a little sketching of various hills & ridges in front of redoubts for Capt Perry. Also marking out ranges for rifle fire\n\n","273":" Another hot day. Turks reported to be about 12 miles from our Position, they are a long time making up their minds attacking us, (looks as if one side couldnt & the other wouldnt) Still working on the entanglements & so on. Our aeroplane was out over enemy positions to day.\n","274":" A regular scorcher easily the hottest day up till the present with hot winds & sand storms. Church Parade held early this morning. One of our new blokes from Australia had his left forehead shattered by a bullet while cleaning his rifle this afternoon ( The old \"Gay\" didnt know it was loaded.) Water is still very short here. Have heard we are to be relieved shortly.\n","275":" Another warm day with clouds of flies.\n","276":" Another \"snifter\" of a day. Heard that \"Metz\" had fallen. Sounds to good to be true. Boys getting their gear ready to move off in the morning. Paid a visit to 9th Light Horse Camp with Sgt Ashburner & Cpl Phillips to night.\n","277":" Stand to arms at 3A.M. Marched out of camp for \"Railhead\" at 5.30 arriving 2 hours later & rested for the day. It turned out another \"snifter\" of a day.\n\n19 Left railhead at 7 a.m and arrived at Serepeum about 9A.M. Pretty dry march as we had no water issued to us before leaving. As we marched into Camp at Serepeum the old 4th Brigade were out to give us a rousing cheer especially the old 13th Bn who had their band out. It was like old times seeing so many faces one knew & made me feel a lump in my neck. A great many of the old boys recognised me & called out. God bless them.\n","278":" The boys had the best part of the day to themselves & indulged in plenty of bathing in the Canal. Several of my old chums from the","279":" came down to have a yarn over old times. Our Coy supplied Divisional duties to night, a bit of a scramble to get enough men together as many went visiting other camps. However I got over the difficulty allright.\n","280":" Church Parades held this morning. This afternoon our 2 friends from the","281":" Light Horse who are camped out at Road head about 8 miles from here, came in to see us, and brought 2 extra horse,s in for us to go for a tour which we did & enjoyed it immensely of course a dip in the canal was included in the programme. The boys have some high jinks in the Canal when any shipping goes by, hanging on to ropes and any other old thing that hangs over the Ships side, thus getting quite a surf bath.\n","282":" Our Company marched over to west side of canal this morning and were issued with high velocity rifles for use in France, also other equipment and clothing, guess we shant be here very much longer.\n\n23 A very warm day. With Sand storms. The swimming parade was largely attended I can tell you.\n\nGood Bye Dear for the present.\n","283":" Empire Day.\n\nThe whole of the 4th Division comprising the 4th, 12th, and","284":" Brigade,s of infantry, together with engineers, Pioneers, and other details take part in night operations.\n","285":" Final stage of operations, which terminated at daybreak this morning, when our force (Blue) attacked position on Suez Canal held by force (Brown) General Cox passes favourable comments on tactics. 45th Bn specially noted.\n","286":" Preparations for our departure carried on with all haste. I was granted leave of absence this morning and spent the day at Ismalia about 10 miles from Serepeum. A pretty little town with Palm and other trees growing either side of the streets, making things cool after the glaring Sunshine. While haveingmy midday meal in a cafe, I got into conversation with a Greek chap who spoke excellent English, he turned out to be a fireman who was on the Seang-Bee which brought us from Australia. We had a good old yarn about events which happen aboard ship & so on.\n","287":" Church Parades held as usual. Turned out a very warm day. Lt Col Herring rejoined us this afternoon & was given a grand reception from the boys. He was wearing the red ribbon of the French decoration which had been awarded him for his services on Gallipoli. Sgt Blenkinsop & myself had a few minutes conversation with him & he showed us both the decoration which is prettily designed, it is called, Chevalier de Croix.\n","288":" The whole of the 4th Division were inspected this afternoon by General Murray, Commander in chief of the forces in Egypt. Also General Cox our Divisional Commander, the march past was not the best by any means, it was rather difficult to keep any line as there was such a thick dust about caused by such a large number of men & horses. However they gave us the same old \"Pretty Cocky\" & said it was fine.\n","289":" The boys marched across \"Serepeum\" this morning with all clothing to be fumigated before leaving Egypt. Q.M. Sgt & myself went for a dip in the Canal this evening, splendid after the heat of the day.\n","290":" All hands very busy to day getting ready for marching out to morrow, the Quarter-Master rushed from all sides by the boys, one bloke wants a chin strap, another a pull through, someone else a field dressing and so on, a great joke. We handed in all Sun Helmets, and have had new Australian felts issued to us, we look brand new again. The","291":" Bde marched out of Camp this afternoon for Serepeum Station we lined the roadway and gave some rousing cheers for the old 13th Bn as they marched by.\n","292":" All on the move early this morning. A.B.C. and portion of D Coys 45th Bn march out this morning for \"Serepeum\" the remainder of our Coy, myself included remains behind to strike Camp & the boys had a fair amount of work to do but after the usual growl set to work & finished in good style. We marched out at about 6.30P.M. & left \"Serepeum\" at 9P.M for \"Alexandria\"\n\n2 Arrived in \"Alexandria\" about 8 oclock this morning & went on board the Troopship \"Kinfauns Castle\". There are about 2,500 troops aboard, including Div & Bde Head Quarters Staff (Generals Cox & Hafuard.) A great many Troopships anchored in Port, including the S.S. Caledonia the vessel I went from \"Lemnos\" to Gibralter in. We anchored out in the Bay all night. \n","293":" (Kings Birthday) The same old bustle on board for the first couple of days, The 1st & 2ng Class W.Os dine in the Officers Mess & we get the very best of what is going, some class sure. We passed by several steam vessels this afternoon, haveingleft Alexandria at 11 oclock this morning. Beautiful weather.\n","294":" Fine weather at sea. There are 6 Troopships in our convoy escorted by 2 Torpedo-Boat-Destroyers. The Vessels steer some erratic courses owing to Submarines being reported in the vicinity. There is very little work done aboard by the Troops, ship is too crowded, guess there would be some scramble if anything serious did occur, as we have not been alloted to boats as yet.\n","295":" We received news from one of our escorts this morning that there had been a Naval action in the North Sea, and we are waiting anxiously for details.\n","296":" Heard more about the great sea fight & by the way it reads we have suffered rather heavily, both in Ships & men, guess its about time our people woke up & didnt underestimate our enemy so much. We passed by the Island of \"Pantalidia\" about 4 this afternoon. Vessel changed course through the night, we are now steaming Nor-West. Our escort left us at dusk to pick up a boat with survivors from a vessel that had been Torpedoed in the vicinity. \n","297":" Sea as smooth as a sheet of glass. Passed quite close to the Island of \"Sardinia\" about 8 oclock this morning, looked very pretty with its farms & wooded lands. About 2 oclock this afternoon our boat nearly ran into a fair sized whale which was on the surface spouting. We have passed many vessels to day both sail & steam.\n","298":" All hands on the move early this morning getting lifebelts & hammocks stowed away, also getting equipment put together ready for disembarking. Sighted coast of \"France\" about 6 A.M. looked very pleasing to the eye after the sands of Egypt. Arrived at \"Marseilles\" about 9.30A.M & anchored in the Bay. The Towns looks very pretty from the Bay with its \"Chateaus\" & red tiled houses & tall church spires. There are a large number of vessels in port flying the flags of many nations. Our ship went into dock at midday and started to disembark troops at 6P.M. We received a warm reception from the French folk. The 45th Bn went ashore at 10P.M.\n","299":" We entrained about 2A.M. this morning, after a scramble for room, the transport arrangements were rotten, the R.T.O & staff dont appear to know their job. However we got away in the end. And what a beautiful sight after daybreak. Beautiful green fields & trees flower gardens looking their sweetest & the birds seemed to be having a day out, judging by the whistling. It is a splendid country, and all the boys appreciated it after their sojurn in the dry desert, We had rations issued to us at a station called \"Avigden\". We were cheered by the People as we steamed through the small stations. We stopped at \"Lyons\" a very large city for about an hour (Tea). One can see on all sides how seriously the French nation is takeing this great war At all \n\n the stations there are numbers of women employed as engine cleaners & doing other railway work, thus enabling the menfolk to join the colours. There were a batch of about 300 German prisoners of war here just brought in from the front. They looked a pretty healthy lot. French folk very bitter towards them.\n","300":" Still buzzing along through fine country. The French Red Cross folk at several Stations gave the boys hot Tea and Coffee which is very acceptable. At the big Stations one sees many French Troops either going to or returning from the Trenches. One also sees many maimed Soldiers about. We passed through some fine fruit growing country this morning. Saw some very large strawberries, best I have ever seen.\n","301":" We pulled up at a Station about 8a.m & made a start on some biscuit & beef, but when half way through the whistle sounded for all to get aboard & what a scramble took place, very funny. We passed through \"Boulounge\" about 10 oclock this morning. There was a large detail Camp there, also many of our Australian Troops from the 2nd Division. We arrived at our destination \"Bailleul\" about 3 miles from the Belgian border about 3P.M. and marched out about 2½ miles from the Town & were billeted in Farm houses and so on, on the Noot-Boon road near \"Meterean\". This place at the early stages of the War was in the hands of the Germans, who were driven out by the \"Gordons\" and Canadians. There are several anti-aircraft guns mounted in the hills for use against hostile aeroplanes. We can hear the roar of the big guns at the front quite distinct. Our Coy are billeted in 3 Farms-houses which are within 200 yards of each other. 2 Platoons in one, 1½ in another and ½ in stowed away in a loft, the boys feel the cold at present. There are always one or more aeroplanes up observing every day. Their is a large \"Hangar\" near the Town.\n","302":" It rained very heavy all night, and we had mud everywhere, quite a novelty after so much sand. Col Herring had the Officers & N.C.O,s together this afternoon to give them a few hints on the wily ways of the Hun. Went into the village of Meterean this evening, one can see traces on all side of the knocking about it received during the fighting that took place in the streets between the British & the Germans. One church has a very high steeple & the Germans had 2 machine guns in the tower during the time they were in possesion of the Town & did great execution with them. Some buildings have been destroyed by big gun fire & bullet marks are to be seen everywhere. One of our Regts the \"Warwicks\" lost heavily just outside the Town. The graves are very thick. There are also many Germans buried near the Township. Guess it must have been willing.\n","303":" The 45th & 48th Bn attended a memorial service this morning for Earl Kitchener, The service was conducted by Rev Capt Ingamel. We are still getting our share of rain. A heavy Bombardment started about 6P.M out towards \"La Bassee\" we could see the big shells bursting quite plain.\n","304":" Rifle inspection every morning in the Barns & lectures while it rains. Col Herring inspected the Coy Billets this morning. We had our Steel Helmets issued to us this afternoon, guess we must look like \"Cromwells Ironsides\" of ye olden times. We get plenty of food & so on, but firewood appears to be very short, of course their must be an awful lot of Troops to provide for. Even the French folk store up all manner of stuffs for firewood, the principal item being old hop-vines & there are many hop-fields around these parts & also splendid wheat paddocks, art present looking their best. \n","305":" About 1.30A.M. this morning there was a terrific bombardment over \"Ypres\" way, and again at daybreak. We heard the \"Canadians’ had done good work through the night. It turned out a fine day. Several Aeroplanes up observing to day, some at a great height. Another Bombardment commenced about 11 o,clock to night at \"Ypres\"\n","306":" Things got very lively first thing this morning., 5 Taube,s came over British lines at a great height, and were fired on by our Anti-aircraft guns, of which there are a great many round about here. The air was filled with bursting shells but none appears to have done any damage to the enemy planes. Another came over towards Bailleul about 11 o,clock but was driven back.\n","307":" Beautiful day, usual parades held. 2 of our aeroplanes were fired at this afternoon, a regular hail of shells being fired at them, but both returned safe.\n","308":" 45th & 48th Bn,s inspected by Lieut. General Plumer this afternoon, the boys looked very smart on Parade. Of course we got the usual \"Pretty Cocky\".\n","309":" The whole Brigade were put through a gas attack this morning, (Mild of course) to test new Gas Helmets. They also used some other \"tack\" for injuring the eyes (Tear Shells) they stung some I can assure you, guess when all these infernal devices are played out, they will start pelting stones at each other or pulling faces & so on\n","310":"","311":" Brigade inspected by Commander-in-Chief of British forces in Flanders, General Sir Douglas Haig, also our General Birdwood & staff. The C.I.C spoke to a good many of the boys about their past experiences on Gallipoli. The \"Soul of Anzac\" looked better than ever, the boys all sang, no one like \"Birdie\". The march past was very good indeed, but would have been much better if the band had been there, we had 2 side drums to go on with.\n","312":" D. Coy marched to \"Ootersteene\" this afternoon for bathing parade which was very nice indeed. Warm water showers to be sure. Our Anti-aircraft guns brought down a Taube this evening. Received a letter from Home sweet home.\n","313":" 1 Officer & 3 N.C.O,s myself included attended school for Bayonet Instruction at \"Outersteene\" under instruction of Sgt-Mjr Barrett of the Coldstream Guards, very interesting indeed, we are to attend for 1 week.\n","314":" Heard an account of the German attack on the","315":" Bn a few days ago, several of our new Stokes guns were lost, also a large number of casualties.\n","316":" A great sight this afternoon when about 20 of our Aeroplanes went up and flew over the German lines dropping Bombs. We heard later they did great damage.\n","317":" A beautiful day, plenty of Sunshine. A great Bombardment started about 7 o,clock to night and kept pounding away for 3 hours at the enemy trenches, a great din, the ground fairly shook. We received orders to move off about 3P.m and marched to \"Outerstiene place of Rondezvou, and then a 9 mile march to \"Sailly\" where we billeted for the night. The German artillery have played havoc with the buildings especially the Eglise (Church). One can see barb wire & trenches on all sides, also Soldiers graves by the score. One of our Aeroplanes was shot down this afternoon from a great height.\n","318":" Everything pretty lively all along the front from \"Armentieres\" to \"La Bassee\". Several Aeroplane actions.\n","319":" Our Brigade marched out from \"Sailly\" about 8.30P.M. this evening. We marched in squads of 6 and 7 men at 15 paces intervals to prevent haveing serious losses in case we were shelled by the enemy. Pretty awkward keeping in touch with each other in the dark, 2 of our Coy were hit by fragments of Shrapnell just before reaching the Trenches. Our Artillery kept up a furious fire on the German positions. We occupied our portion of the Firing line at \"Forays Post\" about midnight relieving the 3rd Bn. Plenty of mud and slush about after the heavy rains, the boys splashing about like so many ducks. The German Trenches are about 300 yards in front of us. The majority of the boys in our Coy are reinforcements who joined us up in Egypt, and naturally some were a bit nervy art first but they soon settled down to business.\n","320":" Stand to arms at 2.30A.M. The Brigadier came around about 3.30AM. B. Coy had 1 man killed & 1 man wounded early this morning. Everything quite again until about 6.30 P.M when they got very merry. Our Artillery opened a very heavy fire on the German Trenches, and of course they replied and there was some screeching overhead as the great Shells tore along. Our Gas Alarm gongs sounded about midnight and our boys donned their Gas helmets, as it was reported the enemy were using Gas, but it was a false alarm. Stand to arms at 2.30A.M. till 4 o,clock, plenty of work to be done, strengthening parapets & dug-outs. The usual amount of sniping indulged in on both sides. The German is not so good at sniping as the old Turk. Enemy Artillery shell A. Coys trenches on our right this afternoon and make several large gaps in their parapets, Another heavy Bombardment after dark & machine guns were barking in all directions. One enemy machine gun in front of our Post is very troublesome, he often sprays the parapet with bullets, the boys call it \"Parapet Joe\". At night the space between our lines and the enemys (No mans Land) is well lit up by their flares which they fire continually to guard against surprise from our blokes. \n","321":" Another gas alarm at 1 o,clock this morning. Raining again this afternoon making things very uncomfortable for everyone. About 2 o,clock this afternoon the Enemy fired a few shells into our trenches doing slight damage to C. Coys parapet, but our crowd escaped damage of any kind. Usual sniping indulged in all day. Enemy shell burst among a working party in the communication trench this afternoon and killed one man. \n","322":" Beautiful Summer Day. About 9 o,clock tonight things got very lively, our guns and Mortars rained Shells and Bombs on enemys trenches, damaging them badly in places and tearing a fair amount of hisbarb wire defences away \n\nThen \"Fritz\" (Germans) took a hand and gaveus a very lively time especially on the right of our Battn, were they thought our Trench Mortars were. A. Coy had 3 men killed & 4 men wounded, among the killed was one of my old mates Signaller Sid Wells who came from Australia in my Coy. Enemy Shells fell pretty thick near \"Convent Avenue\" were our Brigade Headquarters were but very few burst, The village has been battered out of recognition, only ruins remain. And the fields after nearly 2 years of war are growing, weeds, corn, and all description of vegetation.\n","323":" Stand to arms at 2.30 this morning. An enemy Aeroplane flew over our trenches this morning and was shelled by our guns but escaped. This plane is about the fastest I have seen, it could go some. Another heavy bombardment started about 5 this afternoon, our artillery destroyed portion of enemy trenches and wire entanglements. Enemy replied towards dusk and did some damage to our Parapets & dug-outs. Lieut Davis and myself out on Patrol into \"No mans land\" about 10 o,clock to find out how much damage our guns had inflicted on the Hun trenches. We had to keep on the alert because the enemy flew up flares continually, as they must have been expecting an attack from our boys, we got pretty close to enemys lines and could hear them jabbering away while they repaired the damaged works. So we started on our return journey about 2 o,clock in the morning, after reaching our barb wire the fun started, it takes some wriggling through, however while we were twisting about one of their flare light revealed our position and the put over 3 bursts of machine gun fire, the bullets pinged into the ground about us but we never got hit. As a matter of fact I thought the end had come. We had to remain still untill the flare went out, and then made a dash for our lines which we reached safely, me with my togs torn to shreds after my argument with the barb-wire, some joke I can assure you. However alls well that ends well. Our Commanding Officer was well pleased with our investigations. \n","324":" Had a trip to \"Fleur-Baix\" this morning on Court-Martial case. My word what an amount of destruction has been done here by the German Artillery, Churches and other buildings have been battered into shapeless masses. But strange to say The \"Crucifix of which every town is possesed of one or more has escaped injury. There had been some hard street fighting here in the early days of the war , We left on return journey about 2p.m and while going along communication trench the German Artillery were doing a little shooting and some fragments came our way, Cpl Hansen was struck with a piece of shell but as we all wear Steel Helmets, it minimises the damage. Our O.C. received note from Brig-General Glasfaurd in reference to work done on Patrol the previous night by Lieut Davis and myself. Our Artillery shell enemy trenches again this afternoon. 2 of our aeroplanes flew over enemy trenches about 11 o,clock to night and dropped Bombs.\n","325":" Stand to arms at 2.30 this morning. . Things fairly quiet. 1 man of A. Company killed early this morning, 1 of my coy received a slight wound while sniping. Enemy artillery shelled our trenches this afternoon doing some damage, but we had no casualties. We were relieved by the 53rd Bn about midnight and marched though \"Fleur-Baix\" and \"Bac-St Maur\" to \"Sailly\" and reached there about 5.30A.M. and occupied our old billets.\n","326":" Left Sailly for \"Meterean\" 5.30P.M and after a pretty rough march arrived about 9.30P.M.\n","327":" A day of rest, and the boys need it. Some talk about marching off again to night.\n","328":" Left \"Meterean\" for \"Bailleul\" west, and entrained for destination unknown at 2 o,clock this morning. Arrived at place called \"Doullens\" about 7 A.M. after a spell we set out on a 15 mile march to \"Berteaucourt\" near \"Amiens\". A great many men fell out on the march with sore feet and so on. We were billeted in Barns round about the Township.\n","329":" A great many men attended sick parade this morning (after yesterdays march. We rested for the remainder of the day.\n","330":" We heard this morning about the big Advance made by the British on the \"Lys-Somme\". Out for a route march this afternoon. Haveing plenty of wet weather, and the thatched roofs of the Barns dont keep the moisture out much. We get more than a fair share of rain here, while in Egypt we got none.\n\nYours Truly \"Charlie Sausage\" \n","331":" A squadron of 20 Aeroplanes passed over our billets this morning, going in the direction of \"Albert\" which is about 22 miles from here. Heavy Bombardment going on along the \"Somme Lys\". Another 8 mile route march this morning through \"Vignacourt\", many of the lads suffering with sore feet. \n","332":" 45th Battn Training in Wood fighting in \"St Ouen\" woods.\n","333":" Heard this morning that our boys of the","334":" Division had done good work at \"Fromelles’ and \"Fricourt\".\n","335":" The 45th Bn marched out this morning from \"Berteaucourt\" to Rubempre a distance of about 14 miles. A great many of the lads fell out on the march with bad feet & so on. We arrived at \"Rubempre\" about 6 o,clock & were billeted for the night.\n","336":" Turned out at 2 oclock this morning and marched out to \"Vadencourt\" Wood near \"Contay\" arriving about 8A.M. Battn rested for the remainder of the day.\n\n(30)Sabbath. Church Parade held this morning. Grand old General Birdwood addressed our Bn after the Service, a real treat to see his face again, he always wears a smile and has a cheery word for all the boys. He has command of all our \"Anzac Forces\" he is a splendid fellow.\n","337":" Boys making preparations for moving off. 2 Batterys of Artillery who belong to our 1st Division came into the Woods this afternoon to rest for the night. 2 Companys of the old 13th Bn left \"Worloy\" this evening for Battlefields on the \"Somme\" to bury dead of whom there are hundreds both British and Germans.\n","338":" Still waiting for the order to move off. 4 Enemy flying machines came over our lines this afternoon at a great height they were immediately fired on by our Anti-Aircraft guns but escaped. Our Battn marched off at 6P.M. and arrived at \"Albert\" at about 9P.M., The day had been very warm and the roads dusty, causing many men to drop by the roadside. There are a great many Soldiers both French & British about this front, also large Transport & Ammunition Columns and all other details that go towards making an Army. There are Cavalry here by the Thousands. The town of \"Albert\" has been badly knocked about by enemy Shell-fire, up till 4 days ago it had been in their possession, but since the big offensive started they have been driven back. Artillery very active tonight on both sides, Shells bursting by the score, \n","339":" Very heavy dew fell through the night making everything more uncomfortable for the boys, whose clothing was already wet with perspiration from the march of yesterday. Cpl Parke and myself took a stroll into \"Albert\" this afternoon to see some of the ruins caused by the Germans. It is a fair sized place & has had many fine buildings, of course they are now a heap of bricks and mortor. The \"Basillic\" (Cathedral) has been a beautiful Gothic building, but is riddled with shell holes. On the dome of the tower there is a splendid figure of the Virgin Mary holding our Saviour (when a baby) up over her head, The figure must stand about 12 feet high, and is made of metle. Well, this has also been hit, but strange to say, remains hanging among the debris, about 250 feet above the ground. Another terrific bombardment opened up by our artillery about 8 oclock to night and kept up till 3 next morning.\n","340":" German guns again shell \"Albert\" this morning, several hit the \"Basillic\" but the figures still remain in same position. We are expecting to be put into the firing line any moment now. Another artillery duel started again this evening, great clouds of earth are sent high into the sir when our big shells burst. The Germans also shell our trenches heavily, the fields are a mass of mine craters. About 10 o,clock tonight a great bombardment started and the earth fairly trembled. There was a din hundreds of big guns in action at the same time. A great sight bursting shells & flares & what not. Guess the Huns were getting it some. This morning had a bomb accident in the lines, 4 horses killed and 4 men hit, and another this afternoon Lieut Meggit of C. Coy while toying with a German bomb. Another bombardment to night which lasted a couple of hours, a few enemy shells burst close to our Bivouac. Somebody got noises in the head to night and sounded the Gas Alarm, great scramble. We heard that the 7th Brigade had successfully carried enemy trench to night.\n","341":" A batch of about 200 German prisoners were marched in this morning having been captured in the scrap with our boys, they look a pretty healthy lot and not half starved as some of the papers are fond of saying. Many of then appear to be pleased to be finished with the war.\n","342":" Our Battn left bivouac about 4P.M. this afternoon to relieve the","343":" Brigade near \"Pozieres\"whohad lost a great many men in the last 2 days. We came under Shell fire just after entering what is known as \"Sausage Gully\" were the Germans had their 1st Line trenches, we pushed on and occupied their 2nd Line trenches being shelled heavily all the time and losing many men killed and wounded on the way up to the ridge. We occupied enemy trench about 8P.M and what a shambles they were in, trenches torn to atoms by the great shells, dead and wounded Germans and Australian lying twisted and mangled out of recognition. There was hardly a square yard of ground that had not been ploughed up by high explosives, often a shell would get right in a part of our trench and half a dozen men would go out in one pop. There were dead bodies by the score and what a stench. Men were buried by the mass of earth torn up by the great shells, you could see an arm or leg sticking out here and there, its wonderful at anybody being able to stand such a fire, it was a hot shop, Our boys had to crouch close into the sides of what had been trenches and just wait & see who would be next to go. Our Major was standing at the entrance to an old German dug-out, when a shell came and finished the lot. We set 2 of the boys to work to try & dig him out but had to give up. The shells came as thick as rifle bullets & what a roar, when they burst the noise was deafening. The bombardment kept up for hours. The Hun trying hard to wrest the ridge from us at all costs. Lots of my old mates were wiped out & lots wounded. I had a busy time doing up some of the lads wounds, as most of our stretcher bearers had either been killed or wounded. The Steel Helmets we wore save many a men from being badly hit about the head. Poor old Cp. Jack Mullholland got a nasty wound, tried to do my best for him, but he died in a few minutes, one of the boys shouted out to me that young Callaghan had been hit, so I got busy on his wounds & left to see how things were faring on the right, had not gone many yards when I saw some of our boys who had been smacked, standing in one of the old dug-outs, I was just telling them of the great risk they ran of being buried alive, when \"Wallop\" a great shell burst close to us & smashed dug-out & buried several of them, I must have been tossed a few\n\nfeet into the air buy the explosion & got a slight wound on right arm also sundry cuts elsewhere and clothing torn a great deal. I was knocked quite deaf. When I could gather my wits, it appeared that the Battle had finished to me as I could hear nothing. When I found myself bleeding I made to the dressing Station, it was getting light and I saw many of the boys that had come into the firing line the night before lying dead. There were a large number both Germans who had been captured & our own boys waiting to be fixed up, there were some awful wounds. I was very lucky indeed to get off so light. The sights were enough to make your heart bleed. Some of our boys would be helping German wounded to the rear, & vice versa. We had our wounds dressed again about an hour later in an old ruined Church which had been turned into a dressing station. Then we were sent on by Motor Ambulance to \"Contay\" were we remained for the night.\n","344":" We were taken on the Red Cross train about 9 o,clock this morning and taken to \"Boulogne\" Stationary Hospital were we are being attended to. I am still on the deaf side.\n","345":" Still at anchor in hospital. More sick and wounded arrive here from the firing line. We are having fine weather and being by the sea coast makes a bloke very cheerful, especially where there are no shells screaming overhead.\n","346":" Left \"Boulogne\" in Belgian Hospital Ship S.S. Jan Breydel about 10 oclock\n\n this morning and arrived at Dover about 12 noon, after a smart run of 2 hours. After the usual wait in the docks we were taken by Ambulance trains through \"London\" to \"Manchester\" arriving there about midnight, There were a great many people about the Station and as the Cars carrying the Wounded troops came along they were greeted with cheers. We were taken about 5 miles in the cars to \"Stockport\" No 2 Western Gen Hospital Vernon Park. After a good hot water bath which was very nice, and having had my scratches attended to, I tumbled into a nice soft bed and snored a treat & so on.\n\nTell Jenna I still have her little Red shoe. I always carry it in my pocket along with little prayer book. It has traveled some, been to Egypt, Turkey, Gibraltar, England Scotland, back to Egypt, then France and now England again. \n\nI will probably send it home from here \"Diddie\" XXXX++\n\nFrom The \"Linesman tell\" Jenna \n\n1916 \n","347":" to","348":"\n\nA few notes from my Diary \"Diddie\"\n","349":" be interesting for girls to listen to & so on.\n","350":" We are allowed 4 hours leave from Hospital every afternoon, so I took a stroll around Stockport. There are numerous Cotton Mills in this part of England, of course Stockport is a Suburb of Manchester with a large canal running from Liverpool which enables the vessels to bring the cotton straight on to the mills. The City of e United Kingdom to London \"Some City Sure\".\n","351":" A party of us were taken up to the City this afternoon, There are some beautifull buildingsto be seen it is a very busy place. We were taken to a picture Palace which was very nice especially the music We also had our Tea in the City.\n","352":" A small party of us taken to \"Mossley\" about 21 miles from Stockport and went into a convalescent Home away up among the hills. This place is also a great manufacturing centre, Cotton mills & so on. The amount of stone used in the construction of houses & on the roads, resembles Gibraltar in the south of Spain. We are housed in the \"Mechanics Institute\" which has been turned into a home for the boys, it is in the hands of St John Ambulance, and they attend to us first class.\n","353":" A piece of good news in the paper this morning in reference to Roumania,s declaration of War against the Central Powers, they have a splendid Army, which will be of great use to the Allies.\n","354":" A party of us were taken and shown over one of the largest Cotton Mills in the district this afternoon, it was very interesting, they have some wonderful machinery.\n","355":" Took a stroll up on the Hills this afternoon to get a close view of \"Hart’s Head Pike a tower erected a number of years ago, The storey about is , that Mariners can pick up their bearings by it when miles at sea.\n","356":" Another big Zeppelin Air Raid over London last night, One of our aviators brought one down in flames, a grand piece of work to be sure. Two other boys and myself were incited out to Mr Rawsons place \"Herod\" near Stalybridge for Tea and spent a pleasant time Mrs Rawson & her daughter played the piano and sang to us.\n","357":" Left Monday for London at 10 oclock this morning and arrived at Euston Station at 3P.M. and reported to Headquarters, Westminster.\n","358":" Left Waterloo Station at 11 A.M. and arrived at Luggershall Station at 1.30PM and were conveyed in motor cars to \"Perham Downs Camp. there are about ,000 Australian troops training here, mostly new arrivals from home. Also large numbers of Imperial Troops. Met one of my old comrades out of","359":" Bn down here.\n","360":" Great excitement ion London to night. Zeppelins reported to be hovering over the City. All Trains and Trams running with lights out. City almost in darkness. About 10.15P.M. one of the Searchlights picked up a large Airship, it looked very uncanny glideingthrough space at such a great height, it looked like silver in the rays of thesearchlight. Anti-aircraft guns soon got to work and shells were seen to explode near her, then the Airship went higher up. All searchlight were turned off. The streets were crowded with excited women and children.\n","361":" About 1.20A.M. the searchlights were busy again, and located another Zeppelin, Bombs being dropped by other Zeppelins in various parts of the City, and what a din they made, several fell near Stratham Station and done considerable damage. The German dropped several Parachute flares to light up parts of the City, no doubt to pick their way out. About 1.30A.M. there was a burst of flame high up in the air away over near Woolwich, it got bigger and bigger until the whole length of the Zeppelin was in flames and was crashing to the earth, one of our aeroplanes had flown over her and destroyed her. There was mad cheering from the people as she came down. It was a grand sight.\n","362":" A large body of Australian Troops were marched form Perham Downs Camp to Bullford this afternoon, to be inspected by King George, it was a splendid turnout, and the boys looked their very best.\n","363":" About 20 men, myself included, took our departure form Perham Down this morning for \"Aymsbury\" about 35 miles off. Were then marched to \"Rollestone Camp\" about 9 miles further on. We passed by the historic \"Stonehenge\" a pile of very large slabs which have been there for centuries. As a matter of fact no one seems to know the real history about them. We are having extra rough weather in these parts, it has been raining for several days.\n","364":" On the move again. The","365":" 12th &","366":" Training Battalions were marched from Rollestone Camp to Codford – distance 15 miles. We were put into Hutswhich were far better`````tents, especially this weather, as our chaps cannot stand too much of the cold stuff.

I met one of my old comrades Cpl Butler of the 45th Bn late","369":" Bn. The majority of the men i9n Camp at present are recent arrivals from Australia, who are finishing their training in England.

It is a pretty little village and has some ancient buildings especially the Church, Cpl Parke and myself went through the Church which has some very nice stained glass windows.

Although it is situated close to the sea they have no sanitary arrangements. Just about 250 years behind time (more or less.)\n","375":" Paid a visit to the township of \"Paris-Place\" about 4 miles from \"Etaples\" on the coast, and in the Summertime it is a great Tourist Resort for the wealthy classes of France and England, it is just the opposite to \"Etaples\" in cleanliness.\n","376":" We re having some very cold weather here just at present, we have had several frosty nights lately.

Trenches in very bad condition, mud about a foot deep to wade about in. Our :Lewis Gunners pretty busy to night, \"Fritz\" fires a few fish tale Bombs but no damage done.\n","433":" Sunday. The boys indulge in a little snipeing this morning. Others at work improving the trenches. Enemy fire a few fish tail Bombs this evening Young Hobbs was killed & 2 other lads wounded. Stan Coombes, Rocky Adam & myself out on Patrol to night for about 2 hours, wee bit uncomfortable creeping about in the mud from Shell hole to shell hole.\n","434":" Makeing preparations for our raid on Enemy trench. Went along with Major Perry & Capt Knox to Bn H.Q. at \"Pilgrims Way\" in connection with to nights work. Since the thaw set in the ground has been in a terrible state, mud being knee deep in many places. About 9P.M A. & C. Coy began taking up their places in the line, many men got bogged in the mud. After a consultation between the Officers it was decided to leave it untill the weather conditions were more favourable. So the raid was put off for the time being.\n","435":" Drizzling rain set in early this morning makeing everything more uncomfortable in the line. \"Fritz\" fired a great many fish tail Bomb,s near our line this morning. \"Fritz\" Artillery very busy this afternoon shells pretty thick. More noises proposed raid to come off in the morning. Stand to arms at 11P.M. but only false alarm.\n","436":" At 3 o,clock this morning our raiding party consisting of 2 Officers and 100 other Ranks moved out from our \"Block\" on the left towards the enemy block about 80 yards distant, and after 3 minutes bombardment from our Stokes guns we went for his trench and took about 250 yards also 31 Prisoners, there were about 20 Germans killed and several wounded, there was plenty of work for his Stretcher Bearers. Our losses in the attack were 1 killed & 1 Officer & 5 men wounded. In one dug-out we netted 17 Germans, and of course other dug-outs held more, including several who were killed. \n\nAt daybreak several of the enemy crept towards our newly won position, but our boys \"nailed\" quite a few. There was some lively scraping near the \"blocks\" with bombs and so on. Some of the boys hard at work with pick & shovel connecting up with our old trench. Enemy Snipers very busy, several of our boys killed & wounded. One shell burst near our post & killed 2 men & wounded another. Our Stretcher bearers hard at work getting the wounded away, which was very difficult owing to the muddy state of the trench. On one occasion an enemy machine gun opened on them and wounded 2, our bearers had the white flag held up but \"Fritz\" never eased up. None of our boys fired on their bearers when they came out with the Red Cross flag.. We found an abundance of food in their dug-outs and made ourselves right at home. The Prisoners we took belonged to the Hamburg-Grenadiers they were big men, and apparently well fed, their clothing also was of the best, they appeared to be full up of the slaughter.\n","437":" Stand to arms about 4 o,clock this morning, thought \"Fritz\" was going to counter attack, but he would have had a lively reception had he done so. His Artillery got furious about 11 o,clock this morning and peppered our trench and round about to some time. B. Coy on our right had some casualties. A great number of our boys were sent back to the \"Chalk Pits\" to day suffering with trench feet and other sickness. The mud in some parts of the trench is almost waist deep, men get bogged and take some getting out. The conditions are exceedingly bad.\n","438":" Shortly after midnight a raiding party from the 45th & 48th Bn rushed \"Fritz\" trench, and after a short scramble captured a portion, also about 20 Prisoners. They belonged to the 139th Grenadiers. Enemy Artillery again busy this morning. Our Coy pretty weak in numbers, just 40 men left in our sector of the trench, and a worn out lot they are. This makes our 7th day straight off in the front line and the boys are feeling the strain badly. Their artillery got real furious again this afternoon and Shelled our position for a couple of hours, one shell burst right among one post \nand\n killed 4 and wounded 4 of our Coy. We also had a gun position blown out.\n","439":" Everything pretty quiet this morning, Thank God. We have only 31 men in my Coy out of 120 we brought in, this is the","440":" day we have been ploughing about in the mud. Our hearts were gladdened when we heard that we were to be releived to night. Thank the Almighty. \n\n\"Fritz\" Artillery opened up just about dusk, our own guns were fireing short also, but luckily for us none burst. After reaching Brigade Headquarters we were sent on to \"Burnafay Wood\" and then on to Mametz camp reaching our huts about 2.30 in the morning, properly done up.\n","441":" Majority of the boys went to \"Fricourt Baths\" and had a good scrub down, it was a treat to get rid of the dirt and get a change of clothing. Our Band came up from \"Dernancourt\" this afternoon and gave the Bn some music, cheered the boys up a little.\n","442":" 45th Bn headed by the Band left \"Mametz Camp\" about 10 o, clock this morning and reached \"Becourt\" about an hour later.\n","443":" Reorganising Bn this morning.

Marched out from Shelter wood Camp at 7.30 this morning and passed through \"Martinpuich\", \"Pozieres, Le-Sars and camped between \"Warlencourt\" and \"Le-Barque\". The roads are in very bad state owing to such heavy traffic, and are blown up in 3 places. Paid a visit to the Butte-de-Warlencourt this afternoon, it has been almost levelled off with the large number of shells that have been hurled at it from time to time. A large cross has been erected on top to the memory of Officers N.C.O,s & men who fell in the attack on the \"Butte\" on Nov 6th 1916. The enemy had some powerful positions in Le Barque but he had to go.\n\n29 & 30 Stormy weather again.

Most of the big trees that adorned the village have been chopped down.\n","459":" Heavy frost this morning. 45th Bn marched out from Le Barque at 10A.M. this morning and passed through Bapuame\" to a Camp on the Eastern side of the town. \"Bapuame\" itself a fairly large Town, but at present like all other French towns in the War zone that the Hun has been forced to evacuate reduced to a heap of ruins. A few shells fell around the Town this evening from enemy long range guns. Snow falling again to night.\n","460":" Snow fairly thick on the ground this morning. Paid a visit to \"Bapuame\" this afternoon and had a peep at the spot where the Town Hall once stood, but was blown up when the enemy evacuated.

The enemy plane flying very low then made off, followed by shells from our Anti-aircraft guns and bullets from all directions. It was a very smart and daring piece of work on the enemy airmans part, But he was shot down before going very far.\n","461":" Rain fell all last night making the ground in a very bad state again.\n","462":" Turned out a beautiful day.

A great many wounded making their way to the rear, the 4th Bde and portion of our Brigade made an attack on the enemy line near \"Bullecourt\" early this morning and held it about 4 hours, the enemy counter-attacked no less than 5 times, and our lads had to retire on their old positions haveing run out of Bombs and other munitions, the loss,es on both sides were enormous the field being littered with killed and wounded. The \"Yanks\" took part in the attack but were not such a great success on our front as they were in the North. A large enemy Shell burst among our Coy when moving into position and killed Cpl Dawes and 2 other lads and wounded several others, some were blown a great height into the air. An ammunition wagon drawn by 6 mules passing by at the time was blown to fragments, only 1 mule and Driver escaping.

So at 3 o,clock I was taken to Buckingham Palace on my own and after wandering through several Corridors and large, gaudy, Halls etc I was finally ushered into the Kings presence, sure I felt a little excited being all on my own before the King-Emperor of the greatest Empire the world has ever known, (I also felt a wee bit proud of myself when he pinned the Military Cross on my brest and shook me by the hand, exactly what he said to me I cannot quite remember as I was in a sort of fairy-land, I must have been in his presence fully 10 minutes, and he asked me what state I belonged to, if I was married, who I served with in S. Africa, had I been in Gallipoli and \n\nnumerous other questions, and after another hand shake I retired, outside I was taken by the hand again by several Officers belonging to the Kings staff and wished all kinds of nice things and so on.

God Save the King.\n","478":" Took a Train journey as far as Stockport near Manchester and visited the Hospital at Verno Park where last Sept I was a patient, there were no Australians there and very few British Troops.
