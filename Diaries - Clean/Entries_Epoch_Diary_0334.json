Tonight a party of Engineers proceeded to 1st Battln lines to go out & attempt to demolish Enemy’s M. Gun. They were preceded by party bomb throwers but unfortunately this party surprised party Turks in hidden Trench & at once heavy fire was opened on our boys & they had to give up the attempt. \n","59":" \n\nHeavy firing continued during the morning following last nights affair & our boys attacked driving the Turks from a trench which had to be abandoned later owing to enfilade fire from M. Guns. Some prisoners were taken & fair amount loss inflicted on Enemy. Our losses about 8 killed & 20 wounded . Very heavy. Enemy shrapnel during morning.\n","60":" \n\nThings quiet today. A little shrapnel from Turks. Went to church service in evening. \n","61":" \n\nNothing fresh to report. Little shrapnel fire from Enemy, desultory rifle fire both sides.\n","62":"\n\nFair amount Artillery fire from our Batteries usual exchange of rifle fire. \n","63":"\n\nStill driving on toward Enemy’s lines. Enemy forming new firing line 30 yds nearer our position. Things as usual. \n","64":"\n\nNothing fresh to report, usual rifle fire. \n","65":" \n\nMaking good progress towards Enemy trenches with our tunnels. During early morning opened on Enemy’s lines with bombs from Japanese mortar followed by Star Rockets & heavy rifle fire. Enemy replied with rifle. Results unknown. During afternoon enemy opened with heavy shrapnel fire but did not do much damage. \n","66":" \n\nEnemy active again with shrapnel a few men being killed by it. Otherwise things going as usual steady fire all along the line.\n","67":"\n\nHeavy burst shrapnel fire today not much damage done attended unique church parade this afternoon. The subject taken for sermon was from the life of St Paul dealing with his travels to Macedonia in answer to the \"Cry from Macedonia\". Seated on the hill side on a road leading up to the communication trench of 3rd immediately in front of us was the Historic Island of Samothracia close by whose shores St Paul passed on his way to Macedonia the land itself being right in front (not too sure of this) but too far away to see. A little to the left Imbros Island. As we looked across the water we look at one of the most gorgeous & most beautiful sunsets I have ever witnessed the sky being partly covered by fleecy clouds & these were lit up by most beautiful & brilliant light effects in red & gold & silver while under the shadow of the Island itself the sea was marked off in beautiful shades & strips of pearly light. As the night advanced the sun set in golden glory the sky effects becoming deeper & darker red while the Islands became darker & the beautiful purple pink appeared. Then night and the stars & the \"Great Bear\" which we have \n\nbeen accustomed to look at in the North as we used to look at the dear old Cross in the South. While this was happening a Field Gun was hurling shells close over our head into the Turkish lines in amongst the very people who have done so much against Christianity which St. Paul did so much to establish. \n","68":"\n\nA fairly quiet day although there was a fair amount of Artillery fire from both sides. \n","69":"\n\nRather heavy Artillery duel between our guns & Turks at \"Cape Helles\" a tremendous bombardment by our boats is going on. From 8 p.m. to midnight could be heard a continuous rattle of rifle & machine gun fire. Rumoured that our Forces down south making good progress.\n","70":"\n\nRumoured today that the British & French at Cape Helles made good progress yesterday. No official confirmation. Things quiet here.\n","71":"\n\nNothing fresh to write. Battle still progressing as usual. \n","72":"\n\nLight Artillery & rifle fire on both sides nothing fresh.\n","73":" \n\nSame as yesterday.\n","74":"\n\nNothing fresh. Same energetic work going on, sapping & driving toward Enemies lines. \n","75":"\n\nLittle artillery & rifle fire during day. About 10.30 p.m. we opened with heavy rifle fire & bombs all along the line to which the Turks vigorously replied. Our fire had been to find out their relative strength at different points along the firing line and it worked well. \n","76":" \n\nPrinciple work being done driving tunnels in front firing line to form new fire trench. When this is complete we should have a very strong position, much stronger than we have at present. Other things as usual. \n","77":"\n\nSame performance as usual, sapping. Artillery and rifle fire. Nothing fresh.\n","78":" \n\nEverything going well. Usual exchange Artly rifle fire. \n","79":"\n\nUsual work in tunnels & Fire trench & same old exchange of lead. \n","80":"\n\nWork in new firing line going well as is everything with us. Nothing fresh – usual exchange shells & bullets. \n","81":" \n\nNothing out of the ordinary today. Attended Church Service about 7.30 p.m. A goodly crowd gathers to these Services on the hillside & all appear to look forward to having them. As at last service that I attend here there was a beautiful sunset & instead of the loud gun that was firing on that occasion there was a Destroyer firing in the same position work still going on in new trenches. \n","82":"\n\nThere was tremendous bombardment of Enemys position by our boats & land Guns near Cape Helles today. Along the hillside the smoke from bursting Naval shells resembled a bushfire. In the afternoon we made an attack on some Turk trenches in front of our Right Flank & some of the Light horse with part 11th Battln advanced about 800 yds & found a great many dead in some of the trenches that the Turks had abandoned about 8.30 p.m. we opened fire along the line again & under cover of this fire our boys abandoned the trenches captured earlier in the afternoon & returned again to our lines. Our casualties were about 250. During the night some troops were landed down the coast also British French & Indian advanced about 1,000 yds near Krithia & firmly hold position gained.\n","83":"\n\nMore heavy bombardment down coast result unknown. About dusk there was a violent dust storm here & immediately both our boys & Turks opened with very \n\nheavy rifle fire & about midnight the Turks attacked on our left after our boys had made a light attack to draw a counter which proved quite successful. It is estimated that fully 400 Turks were killed 250 being taken from our own lines next morning where we had allowed them to penetrate. Our losses were light, reported to be about 50.\n","84":"\n\nThings were quiet today & scarcely any fire could be heard down C. Helles way. In afternoon I took a walk down toward Gaba Tepe to have a look at lines there. \n","85":"\n\nToday again could be heard very heavy Artillery fire down C. Helles way & it is reported that the British & French are doing very well there. Quiet here.\n","86":" \n\nNothing fresh. Doing good work strengthening position. \n","87":"\n\nLight Artillery fire from both sides. Nothing much doing working in tunnels. \n","88":"\n\nFairly heavy shrapnel from Enemy. About 10 p.m. we exploded mine & destroyed Enemy’s tunnel near German Officers Trench. Said to have done good work!\n","89":"\n\nEnemy firing 11.2\" shells today which appear to be fired from a gun which has been brought up close to lines. They also open early in morning with heavy shrapnel fire. Damage slight. Big gun silent this afternoon. \n","90":" \n\nA fairly large amount of Artillery fire from both sides about 6 p.m. Enemy commenced firing 6\" shell. One of these shells passed so close to my head that I could feel the warmth from it & lodged right alongside the officers cook house, tearing a huge hole in the ground but doing no more damage than blowing things about a bit. Other things going as usual. \n","91":"\n\nThis evening the enemy fired some more 11.2\" shells blowing some of our trenches about badly & burying a good many but as far as I know no one killed.\n","92":"\n\nThere was some heavy Artillery firing today chiefly from our guns & the Monitor. During the afternoon a rather amusing incident occured although it may easily have serious consequences. In one of our tunnels that had been mined by us or rather in the Crater made by the explosion a few Turks had installed themselves. Our Infantry Guard was called out while our boys tried to drop a couple of Japanese bombs in but on re-entering found that the Turks had taken up the position that we had firmly held & thus were masters of the position. \n","93":"\n\nDuring the day a good deal of Artillery fire has been exchanged. During the afternoon the Enemy sent over some 6\" shells knocking the trenches about a good deal & wounding more or less seriously some of our boys. Today we put a mine into the tunnel we lost to the Turks yesterday but again the Turk rushed across the open ground & occupied the Crater. While in this crater the Turks are safe from our fire while they command the tunnel whence as if our boys were to occupy it they would come directly under the Enemy’s fire. About 6.30 p.m. Cpl Gough was shot through the head just above our camp & died almost instantly. \n","94":"\n\nToday has not been very eventful. A good deal of Artillery fire has been exchanged but nothing else worth noting. \n","95":" \n\nThis afternoon there has been some heavy Artillery work & one of our Cruisers has been \n\nclose inshore firing somewhere across the Peninsular repeatedly sending broadsides across. From six to seven PM the Enemy sent along a lot of shrapnel & some heavy shells causing some casualties but although some heavy shells burst in our camp (Engs) covering us with debris we had no casualties. Tonight we opened fire all along the line to divert the Turks attention from Achi Baba where an attack is to be made. \n","96":"\n\nAbout 8 a.m. our Guns opened with heavy fire on the Enemy’s position & we also opened up heavy rifle fire all along our line again to keep the Enemy from turning his attention to Achi Baba. Shortly after the Enemy subjected us to very heavy artillery fire destroying part of our trenches & causing a good many casualties. One large shell burst amongst our H Quarters wounded 3 of our boys & killing an Infantry man & seriously wounding another. A little earlier Sap. McMahon had his arm broken by a piece of falling earth while Sap. Wells was killed in a Sap. by a bomb.\n","97":" \n\nMore Artillery duels today the enemy subjecting us to a heavy bombardment again in the afternoon doing considerable damage to our trenches & causing some casualties. \n","98":"\n\nThe Turks again favored us with heavy shelling this morning blowing some of our trenches & causing some casualties although there was not much damaged done. Our Artillery appears to be doing better work than formerly. Repairing trenches today.\n","99":" \n\nRelieving Cpl Lundy in charge tunnels D.1.A, D.3. D.3A. He has gone for a rest & I take his place until his return. \n","100":"\n\nWork going on well in tunnels. Heavy bombardment this afternoon causing a good many\n\ncasualties & damage to our trenches. Just below our camp there is a notice board & while Sap Lalor was reading some orders on it a shell land a few ft from him lifting him about 20 ft & landing him through a blanket roof on a Q.M’s Store onto the floor some 8’ below. He was rather badly wounded but it is thought that he will get over it alright. \n","101":"\n\nFairly heavy bombardment this afternoon more casualties & damage to our trenches. Our Artillery is doing good work. \n","102":"\n\nAs usual on the Sabbath as much work as usual. Nothing of interest. \n","103":"\n\nA good deal of shelling from Enemy doing some damage to our trenches causing some casualties. Our Artillery replied I believe with good effect. \n","104":"\n\nFairly heavy shelling from Enemy early in morning & again in the afternoon. Our Artillery was fairly active too & appeared to be getting well into the enemy’s trenches. Usual exchange of rifle fire and bombs. \n","105":"\n\nNothing fresh today except that our Artillery put in more than usual. \n","106":"\n\nIt is thought highly probable that the enemy will make an attack tonight & every precaution is being taken to give them a warm reception. Our Howitzers gave them a particularly warm time today.\n","107":"\n\nThe expected attack did not eventuate last night. Every preparation had been made to give them a warm reception but beyond that a good deal of firing about 1.30 a.m. nothing occurred but Artillery is busy again today & the enemy has put in a good deal too this afternoon & also fired some very heavy bombs. One shell 75mm fell amongst our dugouts but luckily did no damage as it did not explode. \n","108":" \n\nArtillery has been busy again today & this afternoon & this afternoon the enemy subjected us to very heavy shell fire. They also fire some heavy bombs about 12\" from a trench mortar but did not do much damage. One of these bombs landed right amongst our stores & burst with great force. It fell right amongst some of our men but did not explode immediately on falling, allowing them to get away without damage. A little before this a large piece from one of there bombs which burst a good way away came straight for my happy home but got tangled in a shirt hanging on a bush outside & then came and knocked a hole through the roof about 1’ long but did no further damage I’m very thankful to say as I wasn’t home at the time.\n\n24th\n\nA small bomb also lobbed in a dugout & wounded Cpl Wood in the leg. He was taken to the Hospital. \n","109":"\n\nEvery preparation has been made to meet an attack from the Enemy as it is thought certain that will attack before long as there has been large forces of Reinforcements brought up. More heavy shelling on both side & a good deal of bombarding throughout the night. \n","110":"\n\nNo attack from the enemy though they appear to be very nervy. We shelled them heavily during the night with howitzer & from Destroyer & again today. During the day we successfully exploded a mine under an old mine crater that they had occupied & were working in. Late in the Evening they again bombarded us with high explosive & other shells blowing our trenches about rather badly in places but did not cause many casualties. \n\nCpt Hartland was covered with earth & died from the effects. Many bombs were exchanged during the afternoon. n mjmnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmn mmmmmmmmmmmnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm \n","111":" \n\nStill the attack does not come. The enemy is firing a good many shells & bombs a scattered area evidently hoping to cause a demoralising effect but not doing much damage. Work Sap, etc. going as usual.\n","112":"\n\nWork going on well in tunnels toward Enemys lines. Fairly heavy Artillery fire no great damage done to our trenches. \n","113":"\n\nNothing fresh doing today. Usual exchange bombs, shells, bullets & other missiles.\n","114":"\n\nSame as yesterday. \n","115":"\n\nAbout 9 p.m. heavy fire broke out all along our line & our boys made & attack on the right. 11th Battln attacking. They succeeded in capturing about 200 yds enemy’s trenches & holding them about 50 yds in advance of our lines. Three mines were exploded by 2nd F. Coy before attack & four failed to explode. Casualties on our side about 10 killed & 30 wounded. We shelled enemy position all night a monitor & a Destroyer taking part & doing good work. Officers in Charge where attack was made say that Enemy’s Artillery fire on our position was magnificent.\n","116":"\n\nNot much shelling today our guns doing most of what was done. Early in the morning a German \"Taube\" flew over & dropped 3 bombs but without much effect but one of 1st F Coy was wounded in the arm (Sap Hartridge)\n","117":"\n\n11th Battln still holding position taken from Enemy. Not much doing today except that enemy dropped a great many large bombs during the afternoon & a good many large shells from a direction not used\n\nby them for a long time. Our Artillery lively as usual. A Taube flew over but sooner \"Imsbid\" after dropping a couple of bombs some where near our Trench evidently afraid of being hit by numbers of M Guns fired at him. \n","118":"\n\nNot much doing today. Roughly same as yesterday.\n","119":"\n\nSeveral thousand \"Tommies\" arrived last night evidently to take part in the attack to be carried out very soon. There are now active preparations for an attack in the near future. About 6 a.m. a Taube flew over the \"Tommies\" dropped a couple of bombs but without results. Heavy bombardment by our Howitzer & lively reply by Enemy. Alls well\n","120":"\n\nMore Tommies arrived last night & more 6th Re Inforcements. Expect big bombardment by our Guns tonight. \n","121":"\n\nToday has been a very eventful one. Early in the forenoon 9 howitzers & 18 pounders began a heavy bombardment which became more intense as the day advanced while in the afternoon 2 Monitors & a couple of Cruisers took a hand. At times the bombardment of the Turkish lines was terrific our Howitzer shell doing great work. About 3 p.m. 4th Battl charged & took the \"Lone Pine\" & held it. Bombardment has continued right into the night. The Turks did not reply so vigorously as excepted altho’ they put a lot of shell in & there fire becoming more effective after dark. Our casualties not very heavy. \n","122":"\n\nThe battle still rages & is developing satisfactorily. During the night the bombardment continued (last night) without a break. A party attempted to go out to the Snipers trench with the intention of filling it in but for some reason or other they did not get there and \n\nthe movement was a failure. About midnight we blew two mines under the \"German Officers Trench\" & the 6th Battln made an attempt to charge it but were met with terrific fire & partly through some bungling here again the movement was not a success, a good many being lost for nothing. The least that can be said of the 6th Battln who were mostly Re Inforcements is that they were certainly not a success. At the \"Salt Lake\" on our left a huge Force of Tommies were land & they are making a good advance on the Turks \"Right Flank\". On our \"Left\" the N. Zealanders did well advanced a good deal & this morning took 900 prisoners. Things are going well all along the line & again today there has been a very heavy bombardment both from the land Batteries & the Navy. During last night the Engineers assisted the Infantry in every way possible & had 3 casualties. Some large shells 11.2\" lodged along the trench where sap. Higgins & I were working today & did a good deal of damage burning a good many. The Turks are putting up a very stubborn resistance.\n","123":"\n\nDuring last night the Tommies made good progress & the Left flank & today continued doing well. In the early morning there was a terrific bombardment from the boats & Howitzers covering the Tommies advance & on other part of the Field N. Zealanders & others are doing well on the left while things are very favorable everywhere. About 9 p.m. news came through that the Tommies had taken hill 971 a very important position. Today Sap. Turnbet was practically blown to pieces by a shell while Sap. Gorham & Stallard suffered heavy shock & injuries Sec. Cpl. Bird \n\nwas hit in the back with stray bullet, it is thought seriously. Saps Getty & Powell missing. Tommies & Australian casualties in this action said to about 5,000. Working today on barbed wire improvements.\n","124":" \n\nThe day opened with terrific bombardment from boats & land guns. All today almost without ceasing both the land guns & those of the boats have been pouring shell into the enemy’s positions. Everywhere almost from every position shells are screaming through the air at times there is a perfect roar of guns & shells. At times the Turks can be seen reaching over the back of their trenches in their hurry to get away. They are fighting very bravely though & hold their positions very firmly & in the face of terrific shell fire at times. They are inflicting very heavy losses on our boys & when we win through this engagement it will be at heavy loss. Still doing well & holding positions taken from enemy. \n","125":"\n\nI was working on repairs to trenches today again early this morning & last night nearly all day with only short intervals between the bursts there has been a terrific bombardment our shell appearing to be going almost everywhere the enemy is established. On Hill 971 where the Tommies had to fall back slightly last night there has been hundreds of shells falling & at times while I was in the trenches I could plainly see Turks running away from the Inferno. I was in the trenches captured from the Turk a few nights since – this afternoon. The sight there is awful, hundreds of our boys lying about dead in the open & right on the parapets & a lot even behind the trenches in some places there are heaps of them. There are a lot of Turks laying about too \n\nbut there does not appear to be so many of them as our boys – although I was told that in the back trenches one could scarcely get along for their dead bodies. The stench is awful and altogether the sight is sickening. Our fire trench there now & theirs is about 20 yards apart & a great deal of bombing is being done. We hold the position firmly though. The enemy put in more shell the past 2 days.\n","126":"\n\nThe bombardment has been so heavy today although at intervals it has been very severe by our guns. The enemy’s guns being rather quiet. The Tommies on our left are said to be doing very well. The position elsewhere remains about the same.\n","127":"\n\nToday has been very quiet in comparison with other days lately. Things are progressing favourably everywhere, especially on the left though slowly. There has not been much artillery fire, except at intervals when our guns would put it in f. very warm. The enemies guns have been almost silent. \n","128":"\n\nToday there has not been much Artillery firing from either side & things generally have been quiet. In the afternoon Sap: Higgins Cpl Mackay & I went across to be Left (Walters Ridge) to have a look & the country that the Tommies & N. Zealanders & some of our L. Horse had just advanced over. The advance has been made up a long valley between & on the slopes of \"Anafarta Range\" & those of \"Sari Bahr\" & the position is now well advanced some few miles inland & up on to the back slopes of \"Battleship Hill\". Some of the country over which the advance has been made is very broken being a mass of little wooded hillock & valleys very rugged & steep in appearance. Across the valley on the slope to \"Anafarta\" \n\n \n\nis a fairly large village but it has been much knocked about & a good deal burned by shell fire from the Fleet. There is a fairly large Mosque with a tall Tower & this appears to be intact. On our way back we had a storm at the \"Beach\" & while there a shrapnel shell burst quite close to us & killed one & wounded another man. \n","129":"\n\nThings have been mostly quiet today. A few high explosive shells came across from the enemy in the afternoon but did not do much harm. Late in the afternoon we could hear a tremendous bombardment going on at Achi Baba. Things going well. \n","130":"\n\nThings as usual today. A fair amount of Artly fire & feeble response from Enemy. \n","131":"\n\nFeeling very ill – off duty. Things appear to be going along as usual. \n\n17th\n\nStill off duty. Feel little better today. A good deal of Artillery fire today – mostly from our guns. Royal \nGeorge\n Edward sunk by Submarine off \"Tantalous Island\", on","132":" with troops aboard (\"British\") – about 2,000, crew exclusive. Only about 600 were saved off a Hospital ship on its way to Alexandria. The \"Royal Edward\" was also carrying guns & Ammunition for the Peninsular. \n","133":"\n\nFeeling better today – resumed light duties listening in tunnels. Late in afternoon the Enemy opened heavy fire with two light guns about 500 yds from our trench in front of \"German Officers Trench\" also with a .75 MM but did no great damage. Our Artillery fairly lively. Other things as usual.\n","134":" \n\nNothing of interest today. Things going well. \n","135":"\n\nVery little Artillery fire today. Our Guns did a little but enemy very quiet. Things quiet\n","136":"\n\nThere has been a very heavy bombardment on our left this afternoon by our Cruisers and \n\nland guns & it is rumoured that the Tommies & some Australians have made an advance there. Some of the Enemy’s 75. MM’s dropped into our trenches knocking things about a bit but only one man was injured. Things generally quiet & satisfactory in our Sector. \n","137":"\n\nNews through this morning (unconfirmed) that our forces on the Left yesterday afternoon & last night captured 4 lines of Enemy’s trenches & are holding them. A little bombardment by our Howitzers in our Sector. Other things quiet & satisfactory.\n","138":"\n\nNothing of importance today. Usual Artillery fire.

Also rumour of British & French success of coast France & in North Sea. Not confirmed.\n","141":"\n\nNothing of much importance going today. In the afternoon the Turks fire a good many Howitzers & 75 MMs but did very little damage. Our Artillery did a little bombing. About 9 p.m. we made a demonstration with rifle fire on our left in support of something the Tommies were doing on the extreme Left. Turks answered vigorously. \n","142":"\n\nReported today that N. Zealanders Fifth & sixth Australian Brgds supported by Tommies made substantial advance in Left Sector last afternoon & night capturing a hill in an important position (not official). Heavy firing continued all night on left & there is still a good deal of Artillery & rifle fire going on today. Enemy Artillery devoted a good deal of attention to our trenches near Courtney’s Post doing a fair amount of damage. Early this morning enemy exploded mine near one of our Sap heads but did no damage except giving a couple of our Sappers a bad shock. \n","143":"\n\nThings quiet today. A little enemy Artillery fire doing very little damage. Our Howitzer replying & getting well into enemy’s positions. Nothing of importance.\n","144":"\n\nNothing of great importance going today.

There has been great improvement since we were here last.

There is a remarkable difference in the appearance of the First Division Camp now and at Mena before we came away to the war.

All the villages like all others that we have seen on the Island are composed of square stone houses with reddish tyled roofs & blue-shuttered windows. From a distance the villages look very pretty with the coloring on the houses & green trees & bushes growing among them but when one actually gets into them the whole has a very dirty appearance & mostly the houses appear to be centuries old. \"Condia\" lies about 5 miles from our camp & is a fair sized village lying in a hollow on rising ground to some hills behind. Just behind the Village we climbed a very steep & rocky hill rising some hundreds of feet above the village & on top of which there is a small church. From here there is a beautiful view. Just below is the village with its square colored houses built at every conceivable angle to each other – narrow streets or lanes & trees here & there & looking down upon it from our altitude it looked very pretty indeed. Looking further afield one had in view the villages of \"Simandria\", \"Portiano\" & several others beside & all the Military camps & Hospitals & a fine view of the great Habor & all the hundreds of boats anchored there altogether the view from this hill was very beautiful\n\n23rd\n\nand looking further away one could plainly see the Island of \n\n\"Imbros\". We returned back to camp through Simandria feeling very tired but quite satisfied with our tour. \n","170":" \n\nHad a quiet day in camp today. Australian mail arrived this afternoon. All having a good rest. \n","171":"\n\nToday had a good walk to top of a high hill about 4 miles away from Camp. Sap Tickle & I scaled to the top of the mountain & while the rest of the party Saps King, Smith Murray H & Taylor & Private Gridler went on to Therma. We were able to get a splendid view from the top of this mountain which is the highest point on the Island – could see all over the Island & as the day was an ideal one the view was very fine. We descended the mountain on the western side & went to Therma which is famous for its hot springs. Here we joined the rest of our party & had a good meal & then a hot bath which was appreciated very much by us all. We all arrived back at camp after about a 10 mile walk feeling rather tired but well satisfied with our outing. \n","172":" \n\nWe did an hours Coy drill in the forenoon otherwise had a quiet day. In the afternoon Sap Tickle & I took a walk to Portiano, a village about 2 miles away & made a few purchases. Things quiet. \n","173":"\n\nA quiet day in camp resting. Nothing doing.

The first boat we visited was the \"Blenheim\" Cruiser from there we went to the Garigan Head – a supply ship. This ship had about 20 shots fired at it from a Submarine while on her way from Alexandria to Lemnos but a French Destroyer came on the scene & chased the submarine which it is thought was sunk. We also visited the great liner \"Olympic\" which is crowded with English Tommies – it is said about \n\n8,000. All appeared to be very pleased to see us & we had a job to get away from them, got back about 8 p.m. after having a good outing. \n","182":"\n\nToday we played cricket against the 2nd Field Ambulance & won 119 to 56. \n\n7th \n\nStill having a good rest.

He is getting better but is far from well. Afterwards we took a walk across the hills & had a good walk.

Think news about 971 not true. \n\n22nd\n\nA wild bleak windy day. Play soccer today against a team from the 1st Battln & we won 2 nil. A rather amusing incident happened this morning after the rations for the day had been\n\ndrawn. Some Cross & Blackwell strawberry jam had been drawn when some of the boys thought they saw a golden opportunity & so took 4 tins apricot jam – the bane of our existence & while the Q.M. was absent exchanged them for strawberry. But there were development as S. Mjr of 2nd F Coy had witnessed the deed promptly reported the happening to our Q.M. who again reported to our O.C. when there was something doing - the whole Coy had to fall in & the tent our tent was searched & the jam duly found. However after getting a good rating from the O.C. who duly emphasised the fact on the perpertrators of the dastardly deed that if he were to push the matter they would all get 6 months hard labor, ordered the jam to be returned & the incident closed.
