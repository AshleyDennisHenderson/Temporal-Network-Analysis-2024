Plenty of digging.\n\nThis station is further north & higher up than Shell Green which is visible away to the left.\n\nI think this place is more dangerous than \"Shell Green\" for shells were bursting around for a good part of the day.\n\nOn the way home stopped at a gun on the way looking south & therefore overlooking \"Gaba Tepe\".

No cases.\n\nRather surprising that for at 8.30 p.m. a sham stunt started.\n\nFirst came a few stray rifle shots, then the rattle of bags of cans being shot over the edge of \nthe\n our trenches, whence they rolled towards the Turks trenches.
