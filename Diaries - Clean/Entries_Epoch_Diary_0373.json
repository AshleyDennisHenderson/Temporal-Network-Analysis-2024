Had to pack our Kit bags etc. but after all wasn’t wanted as we had a spell all the rest of the morning. Had another M.O. parade at 2 o’clock. It rained too while on the parade. Rained fairly heavily too. Moved away at 4.30 (Only wasted 2 ½ hours) It rained well. Marched out to out entanglements & had tea. After tea started work & put in some more entanglements. We were in a sham fight. The enemy came & we left. Major Martyn, Alex N & myself stayed near the entanglement. We went out as scouts with 6 men. We captured 2 men & chased another but lost him. Hit him with a stone while running away but even then couldn’t catch him. Went back to camp & had some tea & tried to get back but got stopped by outposts. Wouldn’t let us through.\n\nRained again & only had out water proof sheet. Really enjoyed the outing though specially the scouting.\n","72":"\n\nLeft our bivouac & got back in camp for breakfast. Rained pretty hard early in morning but we didn’t mind. Had another parade on full MO at 9.30. All No 4 NCO’s went out on horse to view the damage done to the entanglement. Real funny 4 of us couldn’t ride, but we tried real hard & succeeded. Got bumped about myself but didn’t mind. Had a night parade for No 4 only. Did some marching about with picks & shovels for about an hour. Had a bit of a talk to Mirams about night work. Marching by stars etc. Going to do some one night with horses.\n","73":"\n\nHad a parade with bottles & haversack in battle order. Went out to a place a long way off & dug trenches. We were in a sham fight & these were for the arm to retreat to. \n\nA terrible lot of grumbling about the food & QM. Had a kick of the ball after tea & got a sweat up. \n\nOur web equipment is rotten. No one likes it. Helped to develop some negatives. Went to bed early.\n\nLater No 2 Section had a parade at 7 but only the NCO’s turned up. So everyone had to parade at 7.30. Everyone wasn’t there so we had another parade at 9. All the NCO’s got told off at the 7.30 one. Myself for letting drivers act the fool. Didn’t make much diff. \n\nWent to be at 10.\n","74":"\n\nHad a full marching Order parade at 9 o’clock.

Had dinner & demoulted.\n\nHad a section parade at 7 o’clock\n\nPacked & unpacked the wagons Men didn’t like it, & when we had to do it again well they were dissatisfied. When lifting it up our end with the other wasn’t lifted. My nose bled & making the excuse was told to wipe it. A huge joke. Was thick as mud though so it didn’t take any effect. Went to bed at lights out. No 3 Section didn’t do anything as they were to attend the funeral of Godley. The funeral didn’t come off\n","76":"\n\nWent to Old Cairo & saw some old churches that were supposed to have been used by the Christians in the time of the Romans. One where Mary & Jesus were supposed to have been in also Moses. Went for an hour & a half tour about in a carriage & saw a good many places, hadn’t seen before. Came back at 6. Had tea & played football till dark. Took a photo of the oldest Mosque in Egypt. 1400 years old & built by Oomah. Wrote letters home.\n\nNo 3 went to funeral of Godley. Wouldn’t liked to have gone. The pottery’s are good. The niggers have a round piece of wood on which they place their feet. Also a round piece on top to which is fastened the clay. These two are joined together with a round piece of stick. The niggers turn the whole lot with their feet and model the clay with their hand. The make water jugs etc. These are then put in the furnace & finished.\n","77":"\n\nWent over to the Sphinx & had my photo taken in front of it instead of going to the church parade. Messed about all day. Had a tent inspection. Wrote letters in the afternoon but took a long time owing to talk & weather. Very hot today. Played football of course got very hot. Went to bed early\n","78":"\n\nWent out a couple of miles & put up entanglement. Infantry dug trenches behind the, & also dug post holes & out the posts in. All the engineers did was the wiring. Do us. Correct way to do things. Actually did some wiring myself. Don’t often work so it was quite a change. Tried bombs & hand grenades. There is going to be a sham fight tomorrow night. No 1 Brigade will get a shock. Making a box Kite to take a flare behind them & show them up. \n\nWent to bed early.\n","79":"\n\nLeft camp early & went out to the wire entanglement. Had to put in a low wire entanglement. Dug out 50’x14’x1’ & put in the wire & posts. That finished all our work so we went back to our bivouac position. Had dinner & slept. Got awakened to get two letters one from home & one from MG. Very nice receiving letters on the desert specially photos as well. Cheers one up a lot. \n\nHad tea & made our beds. We didn’t hear any of the fighting. Heard & saw the trial flight of the Kite that was all.\n\nWent to bed & talked till 9 o’clock about Bis.work & soldering etc. \n","80":"\n\nHad a good nights sleep. Got up at ¼ to 6 & had breakfast out & then marched back home here.\n\nNo 4 Section had a parade at 10. Marched about the hill & my squad I took down to have ice cream while the other squad were standing easy. Good move but the others didn’t like it. Too hot making our section drill while the others have a holiday.\n\nGot a letter from Mary & 2 papers from Alice G. Read the account (or rather my letter) in the Barrier Miner.\n\nLeft here at 4 o’clock for another bivouac near the entanglement. Got there & had tea & then went to bed as we weren’t wanted until 12 o’clock.\n","81":"\n\nPay day got 102 piastres\n\nGot awakened at 12 & took 10 men with me. Went out in front of trenches & made imaginary wire entanglements by placing teacups of stones in positions as posts. Finished at 2 & went back to bed. Got up at 5 & had to wait until 6 before we came home to breakfast. Went to doctor with pimples on the neck & got painted with iodine.\n\nJust before dinner got warned for duty as escort with two men to go to Cairo for 2 prisoners & to collect a sick man from the hospital at Heliopolis. Had to be at Heliopolis at 4 o’clock & just got there. A man who goes there is generally sent home to Australia. Sent the other home in the train to Mena & then went for the prisoners. Got them at the Military Police Barracks & had to wait for an hour before we could get home they were cleaning the reservoirs out & water was running through the street. \n\nSorted out photos & went to bed at 9.30. One of my men was drunk & of course things were funny.\n","82":"\n\nEarly marching parade. Pimples seem no better yet. Worked all the morning on a weldon trestle & 14 of the section went out on wire entanglement. They had to work pretty hard & came home about 2.30.\n\nWe had a parade at 5.30 in full MO. having to carry one or more blanket ourselves.\n\nMade our packs heavy. We marched out & came back towards the spot for the simple reason of attacking the place from a certain position. We slept from 9 till 12.30 & then started the attack. Marching was good & the formation we got into great specially in the dark. We had to stand for 2 hours, weren’t allowed to sit down Was murderous. After we advanced a little we were told to lie down but only stayed down 5 minutes & had to move on. Our job was, taking the wire entanglement down & putting it up in an advanced position. No more sleep & everyone was tired. \n","83":"\n\nWorked on entanglement till 5 then came back to camp. Got back at 6. Everyone more or less knocked up. Had a bonzer bath & a big breakfast & felt fit. The rash was pretty bad & some kind of ointment. Simply burnt in far more than iodine. Am going to Matarea to see the Obelisk.\n\nNeck pretty bad got a bandage put on but it didn’t relieve it at all. Had to walk about to keep the pain down.\n\nWent into Cairo & had to grind my teeth etc. to keep it down. First chemist shop I saw hopped in & tried all his ointments for soothing the burning. Didn’t have any thing good enough so tried another & got the same result. Got my photos & came home. Got home for dinner. \n\nHad a couple of icecreams in town. Went to the doctor & he put on some dusting powder, soothed it a bit, but when I went up again all my neck was blistered. Very sore too, had a blister from chin to ear. Wrote letters & went to be at 8.30.\n","84":"\n\nWent to Doctor & got blisters fixed up. They burst in the night but some still full. Were not sore but couldn’t move the head too much. Wrote a letter home. Also sent home book & some views & photos. Very dusty today. Absolutely rotten. Didn’t go to church parade but messed about in camp. Was very dusty & spoilt everything. \n\nWe now belong to Sir Ian Hamilton’s Meditteranean Exp. Force. We fight in Turkey. Hamilton is inspecting \nthen\n us all tomorrow.

At 2 o’clock a chap was admitted & kept us awake for a while. Read all day & went down to lines for a stroll. Plenty of men going to Mena. Got a big lump on neck & doctor came & had a look just before I went to bed. Couldn’t do anything – \n\nPrinted photos in the afternoon\n","88":"\n\nHad a fairly good night. Lump very large so doctor sent me to Mena Hospital. Took back books & printed off some photos & came to Mena at dinner time. \n\nHad custard & milk for dinner & a bath & then put to bed. Doctor came & had a look & asked me if I could stand being cut said yes so the nurse fixed me up & the doctor cut it. Made a big deep cut & got a lot of matter etc out. He was saying ‘That’s a good boy’ & stuff like that making out he was cutting my neck off. Have a very big pad over it now,\n\nHad to take medicine, but am allowed food. bread & butter, eggs etc whereas others only get bread & milk, when I get porridge, Have 4 meals a day.

At 10.30 doctor Levers came up & woke\n\nme & wanted to know if I wanted to go away. Told him yes & he asked me about my neck etc. Said it would be alright & would see Lt Col Wark\n","90":"\n\nUp early & had a bath. Neck feels better, bandage has slipped. Seems true that everyone is moving so I must soon get better. Broke the strap of my wristlet so I have to use a bandage. Was a bit riot in the city last night. Some of the boys set fire to some bad houses & the military police shot some of them. Serves them right. (Rather no one killed).\n\nDoctor came & allowed me to get up. A lot got discharged to join their regiments. I’m going to try tomorrow to get out. Wrote home & to Madge. Got neck dressed but it hurt a terrible lot. Still bad. Nurse reckons I won’t get out for . Allowed out & went down to bathe. Stayed there a long time & got everything paid. Saw the Inf. Marching out. When I went to bed had a swelling on my foot. Showed it to the nurse & she said I would have to have it cut also\n","91":"\n\nGot up and everything on foot better. L Col. Nash came down looking for me & had a look at my neck. Said it would be alright but must look after it. Gave me some pills & have to take 2-3 times a day.\n\nPrinted off photos for the nurses & took two of them (photos I mean). Corpl. Boyd called for me & came out at 11 o’clock. Packed my Kit & have to wait about till 6 o’clock.

Took the sisters photo this morning. Gave sister Fellan a small dictionary. Collected £1-6 for pay. Also got a few books. Kicking about in the mess. Everyone is excited. Don’t know what they are doing. King came over with message from mother\n\nLeft camp at 10 o’clock. Marched to Cairo Ten of us rode in the waggons. Weren’t strong enough to carry the packs. Got there at 1.30 PM. Got all our caustic horses packed. Three of us got on the horse train & were supposed to get out at the main station didn't stop so went straight on to Alexandria\n","92":"\n\nSupposed there was a bit of trouble over us & there was we didn’t care much. Neck was sore. Got to the boat about 10. She is AB. Mashroba . Nowhere near as good as Orvieto. Went to Alexandria for photo. material but all the big shops were shut. Got some chocolate & ointment for some of the boys. Posted letters for them too. Brought some p.c. & sent them home & to MG. Felt pretty rotten. Had a terrible headache etc so we came back in a carriage. Went in on the tram. Much the same as in Cairo. Had some fresh lemonade in the city & it was the best I’ve tasted. Was in siphons & was nice & cold. Came back to the boat & lied down on deck & felt sick. Just before tea the doctor had a look at me & sent me into the hospital. Was the 1st in. Had pains all over & was very hot. Had a high temp.\n","93":"\n\nWoke up with a terrible dry & sore throat. Couldn’t swallow spittle. Doctor came & said it was tonsilitis but didn’t seem to like a look at my neck. Probed it & made it bleed. A few of the boys brought in oranges (the only things I could eat). The boys made a terrible fuss at both breakfast & dinner times, singing & stamping their feet. The couldn’t get enough to eat. One way of asking for it. Didn’t eat anything else, except oranges, all day.\n\nRead some papers & books all day.\n\nThe boat seems an old tub \n.\n","94":"\n\nWoke up with a dry mouth. Throat sore on one side only. Boat pulled out at 7 AM. & came out straight away. Don’t know where we are going. We’re the only boat out. She seems an old tub. Rocks & rolls a terrible lot making a good many of the boys sea sick. Suppose I would have been with them only for being in bed. Couldn’t eat much all day. Had broth & oranges. A mail came on board before leaving, but I didn’t get any. Read some \"Ages\" \"bulletins\" \"leaders\" \"herald\" all belonging to some of the boys. Have a sergeant AAMc in with pneumonia. P. Molloy had his knee straightened & put in splints. Had a good sleep but the weather is changing.\n\nQuite cold now, different to Mena at present.\n","95":"\n\nFelt much better both in neck & throat. Throat seems to be better. Doctor came & said could go out, so after a bath got all my belongings out & moved down with the boys. Got my kit put away but wasn’t booked booked for a table so have to bum anything I can. Feels real good out in the breeze. Different to being in bed. Makes one feel very joyful. Passed Rhodes Island about 12 o’clock & kept\n\nPassing small islands all day. Seemed hilly & one had moss all over it. Had a look at the engines, boilers & propeller shaft in the afternoon. Bosker engines. We are going almost full ahead so must be doing about 13 or 14 knots. Went to bed at 7 o’clock. Couldn’t go to sleep too early though as the boys made a row going & coming on the stairway (gangway).\n\nFriday 9 April 1915\n\nUp early (about ¼ to 6) Neck wasn’t dressed properly yesterday & the blankets rubbed it. Passed some decent islands on both sides. Had a parade & disembarkation practice. Have 16 men & we are with 907 No 3 in No 3 in No 3 boat on port side 1st load. All right being in the first landing. Have to stand by with full M.O. & blankets & then climb down the ladderway at the side. Getting fairly cold here. Got to Lemnos island. It seems to belong to Turkey. Looks a decent place. Bosker natural harbour & will hold plenty of shipping. Green lands all about & 4 villages round the harbour. A camp of some soldiers is near the entrance. They seem to be French, by the color of their uniform. The place seems very misty. Altogether it seems a decent island & is only about 50 miles from the Dardanelles (where were going). Went to bed at 8 as the lights went out. Have to keep them out as we are in the danger zone.\n\nSaturday 10 April 1915\n\nUp early (1\/4 to 6 again). Neck getting better. Had an early morning parade & after brekker had a FMO parade & marched about the decks. The AMC boys sing & whistle & made a terrible row. Have another parade at disembarkation practice at 3.15. Some mail came on board but didn’t get any. Suppose mine will come later. Nothing much to do. Had a lesson in bayonet drill in the afternoon. A few more transports came in with troops. One cruiser goes out & one comes in to take its place everyday. Plenty of torpedo destroyers kicking about. Also 2 submarines. Quite a big collection of war boats here now.\n\nLow Sunday (1 After Easter) 11 April 1915\n\nHad our usual morning parade at ¼ to 7 after a church parade at 10.30 had the day to ourselves. Mr Dexter was sent for & came over to conduct the service. While at the service the \"Clan McGillivray\" came along side with 7th &","96":" Batt. on board. They are absolutely crowded. She is going to stay. A few others were like that. Seems as if it is for more room. A sea plane went up & scouted about. She looked A1. Wouldn’t mind going up in her. \n\nPlenty to interest us today. A mail came on board. Got 3 letters 1 from MG. 1 from Clarice 1 from Ed Russ. Can’t answer them so suppose they will get a bit of a shock.\n\nThe boys on our boat nearly bought all the cigarettes & were selling them to the Clan Mac. They are only allowed to get 1 packet each now. Very foolish of them. Had a good sing at the piano. Livens every one up. Makes it more like home.\n","97":"\n\nA couple of boats crews went out early for rowing. Took dear Mr Dawkins out. My word both he & Mirams have got themselves disliked. Don’t treat their men properly – They are too boyish & silly. Had mad brained ideas. It’s a pity because Mirams started out so well. Went over to the Ionian & Suffolk 10th Batt &","98":" Engineers on board. Got sick after getting there. Don’t mind as is cleared out my stomach. Do me good. Went on board the Ionian & had a yarn with Albert Byrne. They have been here 6 weeks. They go on shore every day. Better luck than we have. Had a concert on board. Didn’t do too badly either. A few more boats came in. Went to the doctor & have to leave off the bandage. Have to put some lotion on the pimples. The neck isn’t much better. \n\nThe O’C’s of each arm went to the Dardanelles on the Queen Elizabeth to examine it & pick of landing places for us.\n","99":"\n\nSome of the boys had a bad time last night. Got wet right through with the rain. It is raining all day. Had another route march. Then rifle drill with nos. with dear Miro. After we had disembarkation practice. Climbed down to the boats with the ladder & climbed up again. All in the rain. A mail arrived but so far haven’t received any of it. Didn’t receive any mail. Our table had a hash made & everyone had a good old feast up. The best we’ve had. As a rule we got good food but not enough. Now for brekker we get porridge & 1 slice of bread with 2 slices of bacon. For dinner we get bully beef &","100":" a potato & 1 slice of bread. For tea 1 slice of bread. In the morning we get 1 tin of jam (7 lbs to do 22 of us) all day. Get tea every meal. We get big biscuits but one can’t break them leave alone eat them. \n\nWent to bed at 8. O’C’s got fired at but were not hit. The report isn’t favourable as we have to wait longer for more troops. The boats didn’t do enough damage.\n\nWrote two letters One home one to MG. then way with the AMC. They had to pass the censor so don’t know whether they got through or not\n","101":"\n\nAnother route march round the deck. No 4 had disembarkation. Got into the boat & rowed round the ship & them climbed up the side. The pack seems to be getting heavier every day. More disembarkation drill this afternoon. The Clan Macgillivray moved away from us. Went in for water we think. Had a bayonet drill after the march & it lasted till dinner time. Had a talk on the Dardanelles. The boats haven’t done much damage to the forts. They are waiting for a land force before again attempting to force the Dardanelles. Getting cold again here. Went to bed after doing a little bit of reading.\n","102":"\n\nMade arrangements to have a tooth stopped. The boys all went ashore for a route march so didn’t go. The dentist himself went so it was a waste of good time staying here. The boys thoroughly enjoyed their trip. Reckoned it was good. Got plenty of bread & fruit. Got mixtures of change. Greek, Italian & French etc. coins. We (those left on ship) had a good old meal. Had a hash for dinner. Had plenty to eat on account of there only being a few of us here.\n\nRead the Australian all through.\n\nDidn’t know what to do with myself.\n\nThe boys came back & said they had had a glorious time. So am going to try & go myself tomorrow.\n","103":"\n\nAll those who didn’t go ashore yesterday went today, so I was amongst them. We got to Lemnos at 11 & went for a bit of a march. Left our packs at the foot of a big hill & climbed the hill trying to see the Dardanelles. They was a big hill in front so we couldn’t. Marched back to the Kits, had a dinner & got dismissed in the village at 1. Had to meet again at 2.30. Went all round the village seeing the sights. The oxen have a very pronounced hump. The men use the old wooden plough (same as Egypt). They have large sail windmills took a photo of a couple not being used). The soil is very moist & there seems to be plenty of springs about. Took a photo of women washing clothes & another of the township. There are several townships but we only went through the one. The houses are all in stone & seem to be very clean. The people being Greek. A few speak English but the kids even here ask for backshesh.\n\nWe have a wharf made & near this there are a few stalls (or rather shops) Altogether spent an enjoyable day without spending a penny.\n\nRather mean but only had 1\/- & quids so of course loath as to break a £ 1. Got back to ship & was orderly Corp. First time on the ship. Neck has been very sore & by the size of the new lump will very likely have to be lanced.\n","104":"\n\nOrderly Corporal today. Had a big sick parade but the doctor wasn’t much good. Paraded myself but he wanted to put iodine on me. Wouldn’t let him so he said he would have to wait until it was ripe. It was very sore in the night & has been aching all day. Had the nerve killed in my wisdom tooth & am going to get it filled. The boys were allowed to go in for a swim as about 20 went in. Went on sick parade & the doctor (a different & better one this time) cut it open. It didn’t hurt very much but the iodine hurt more afterwards than the cut. Nothing much doing things seem very quiet. The sea being quite calm. A couple of our boys went ashore to the hospital with bad knees. One being a good schemer & we think is getting cold feet. Went to bed early again as usual. The tooth aching a good deal.\n\nSunday (2 After Easter)","105":"\n\nTooth better. Went to doctor & got neck dressed. Got some opening medicine. Have started to get a list of the boats here in port with troops on board. Church parade in the morning but didn’t go on account of having washed the neck of my tunic & it was wet. Put the afternoon in by looking through the telescope & getting names & numbers of the transports. Got a good many now & have a total of 50. And have the cruisers etc. As well. Did a good afternoons work. A mail came on board & got 5 letters. One from Mother & Chris with french. Couldn’t understand it all either. One from MG. dated 5th March. Got the last letter first. One from Mabel, one from Aunt Maggie & 1 from Ed R. They came while playing cards & had to finish the cards. Read while playing cards & didn’t take much interest in the game. Lights out went before we knew where we were.\n","106":"\n\nHad a rather bad night. The boil on the back of the neck was very sore & every time I moved on it, it woke me up. Went to the doctor again & he lanced it. Have 3 lanced now so ought to have plenty of scars. Am getting another one too so am still unlucky. The doc. put some stuff on that froze the spot & couldn’t feel the knife going in. Didn’t do anything all day except look out for new names with the telescope. Neck was very sore when dressed in the night.\n\nWrote 2 letters one home & one to Madge G. Am going to write to Aunt Maggie tomorrow.\n\nHave been offered 2\/10\/- for camera & some more money for luck. \n","107":"\n\nHad another boil coming but got it stopped by having it opened a little. Had to wait 2 hours to get the neck dressed so didn't go on parade. Had to hand in our 2s & Engrs badges in, in the afternoon & then took 4 men on the top deck signalling. We didn't do much signalling did more looking through the telescope. Water boat Sunik came alongside & gave us 2000 tons left just at sundown. Started to get very cold.\n","108":"\n\nHad an extra early parade at 8.30 in FMO but it fizzled out like everything else does. Too cold for the Major to come out & address us. Very cold last night. Rained nearly all day. Didn't have ant parades in the afternoon. The HE2 submarines came into port. Cruiser Minerva passed very close. Had neck dressed a couple of times & feels much better. Signal Coy went over to the Novian. The HQ men went as well. We were supposed to leave today but I think we leave tomorrow. Lets hope we do as we are all tired of being here doing nothing. the Hymettus got aground & two tugs tried to get it off. Went up for posy to sleep, but it had gone so slept outside.\n","109":"\n\nCold last night & rain again today. Hymettus aground all day. Tugs couldn't move her. Our boys went ashore with pumps to test them but didn't go as it was too cold. A mail came & got 3 letters 1 from MG, Mother & Chris also a Miner. Not too bad. Letters were very decent too. Had a hash for tea & played bridge all the time after tea until lights out. Read papers & translated Chris french. Got a couple of new fresh boats names. Will soon have them all.\n\nLice kicking about now so will have to be careful. Haven't got any yet & don't want any. Boils much better will soon be free altogether of them. Letters were dated 8th March 1915.\n","110":"\n\nNeck almost better now. Have dry dressings now. Doesn't look as if the Hymettus is off yet. Had another easy day. Washed clothes & played cards. A few of the boats went out & we are supposed to leave early tomorrow morning. the boats mostly had English Tommies on. Hope to goodness we go tomorrow am sick of being here. Posted the letters as the mail wasn't opened earlier. A concert on tonight & it went off well. Some real funny items coming from the buglers.\n\nHave a light cold but it ought to soon be better.\n","111":"\n\nWoke up at 6, but we had already moved out. We left our anchorings at 5 & went 12 knots & stopped at 10.30 & anchored. Very cold though. Everyone has cold feet (not frightened though). Neck is very much better & needs only 1 more dressing. We have orders to have blankets rolled (to leave behind) & be ready to leave the ship at 5 tomorrow morning. Major Martyn addressed us on subjects about the Turks. pillaging, etc looting, about aircraft & general war items. Everyone is in a hurry now to pack kits etc. Played euchre in the afternoon & when went down for tea the hurry & bustle was still on so in consequence didn’t have tea till later. At 7 oclock five cruisers came in sight. they were Majestic London (flag ship) Prince of Wales Queen & Euryalus. We land under their fire. We have here in this spot 12 transports & all land together. We have brekker at 4 so won't have much sleep. There are altogether 3 landing places but don't know exactly where they are.\n\nSunday After","112":"\n\nGot awakened at 3 & couldn't have a light so naturally everything was upside down, Had to hand in blankets in & brekker was a general mix-up as everyone got their own. the guns on the cruisers opened fire about 5 & it looked well from the boat. Could see the flash & then the all the earth go up. The enemy are replying so we are doing well. We have to make a road 1 ½ miles long so perhaps a few of us won't be able to tell the tale. Destroyer \"Bulldog came alongside & told the ship to get in closer & unload us (6 AM). The Foxhound (destroyer) came alongside & we crossed over from her to some cutter & then were towed ashore leaving at 7.15. Landed under fire & were fired at before we got out of the boats. We ducked a treat. My word the shrapnel simply moved our boys down. their rifle fire wasn't good & more rifles couldn't content with their artillery. Hundreds of our boys kept coming back wounded some having terrible wounds. First couple of boats to land completely wiped out. Officers were killed a treat. We made roads for artillery & dragged the only one ashore up to its position. We turned in till 10 & then came up on the hill & dug trenches under fire. After we finished we retired behind the hill & our own came in. the infantry taking our position. It rained & made matters worse. The soil is very damp & the ground hilly. We got water but had to leave the position as the shrapnel came. We have taken a couple of miles of country. Hope we keep it. Shraps kept pouring through.\n","113":"\n\nPlenty of firing all night only no artillery. We landed a couple of guns & they are in a position & have silenced the enemy for a while. We kept our ground & have now pushed in again. We dug ourselves well in again & started brekker & had to stand to arms-up. Finished brekker & went into trench to collect all shovels as ours are, wanted (being big). Shrapnel started & we couldn't leave for a long time. Our boys are doing well & have gone forward a good deal. Took 11 M Guns & 1000 prisoners. The Lancashire lads are coming up behind & we now have the Turks in between 2 fires. Came back to Depot & had a good sea wash & then a good dinner. Had teas, bully beef & biscuits. Had to fall in for roll call & found we had only 2 men wounded. Told to fall in at 5.30 AM tomorrow & then went to bed. The Lancashire Fusilers were sighted on left flank so tomorrow we ought to get the Turks in between 2 forces. My word they deserve it. Machine gun shots falling in the water all the time, as long as they go there no one is hurt. Not so many casualties today. Our artillery keeping the enemies quiet. Up all this time we haven't fired a shot & have been shot at pretty often. Heard that Col K. was shot in the face. Major B still at the front with a wound in the foot. Poor old Byrne got killed & I believe Terry was also though cant get it confirmed.\n","114":"\n\nWe are still doing well. got up at 4.30 & it was too early so went back to bed & got up at 5 & had brekker. We have 2 water proofs to sleep in. Started to move our store further down & saw the Capt on the way. Had a yarn with him & he is shot through the ear. No too badly. Heard that Perry & Byrne were in fact wounded & not killed. Hope its true. Had to go to firing line & put in a wire entanglement. Just got over the ridge & all had to take cover on account of the shrapnel. Had to stay in the posy for hours. It was terribly hot. We were only just missing the shells though being under cover. When it slackened we moved up to the water supply. I couldn't get any further again on account of the shrapnel they had. They do go close almost at ones feet being only a few inches away. A Turks captured & a couple of German officers. Caught in NZ uniform & reckoned they were interpreters. Moved again & got to Brigade HQ. Fire was too hot so we couldn't get up any wire entanglement. We improved lines of communication by making roads. After we finished we carried barbed wire & tools to the highest point of the firing line for entanglements. Fire was very hot so we couldn't do it. Had to come back to the water supply. Had a little heat there. Moved right back to the shore. Got there at 3. Only been going 22 hrs was very lucky a shell from the shrapnel burst at my feet & only got mud thrown on my feet. Do me. Another of our boys got it again.\n","115":"\n\nHad 2 hrs sleep. got fresh rations though only for the day. We are still holding our own & want reinforcements. Got up at 5.30 & had brekker & told we wouldn't be wanted till 12.30 so all slept, Got up for dinner & messed about till . Things seem much quieter today. Very little artillery going on. Some more transports came in but we don't know with what kind of troops. Moved stores from one to the other & am waiting now for dark to go & dig more tranches. Got fresh rations & just at dusk some Indian troops landed. They reckon we are going to charge tonight. If the Indians go into the line it will burst.\n\nThe cruisers are doing great damage across the straights. Our guns have been doing great damage today, have silenced the enemy artillery. Went out at 8 to the supports & dug trenches for them till 2 AM. Rifle fire was pretty strong but none of us were hit. Put plenty of energy into the pick to start but as soon as we got cover we took it easy. It rained & that made things very awkward. We all got wet of course coming back got very cold. Marine L. Inf. landed & went into the trenches to give our boys a spell.\n","116":"\n\nGot up at 7.30. Had brekker but took an hour to make the tea. Had a wash in clean water & washed a pair of sox. Slept in the morning & had to take the section up to improve lines of communication. Went up but No 3 Coy were on the job so left it all to them & came home. Met Will Perry & all No 3 Coy. boys Louis Avery etc. Poor old Byrne was killed. Jim Hardingham came up to see us. Went up on a ticklish job at 8 o'clock, plenty of snipers about. We had to dig a comm trench so men could move easily when shrapnel came down. In the day machine guns swap the spot so the trenches need to be fairly deep. We had almost finished when they started putting shrapnel into us. Hit in 18 shots & everyone burst immediately over head & lumps of lead etc were flying about close to us. Luckily none were hit. We left & got back at 2. Lost the track once Alec Hewlett got hit in the groin while his section were on wire entanglements. The village close by is on fire & we can see the reflection. The cruisers blazed away all night did some big damage. A chap got killed on the beach swimming in the water. Had very stiff luck \n","117":"\n\nGot up at 8. Had a 6 hr sleep. Handley got hit by a stray while on the beach. Mirams has a poisoned foot & has to go to hospital & am left in charge for a while. Had a check & rifle inspection & at 6 went with Dawkins to look at site for wire entanglement in the night. they were on rt flank of firing line between","118":" Gun & the end of the trench about 300 yrs. Came back & got section working cutting up timber. Left here at 9.30 & got to the job about 11. Went out in front & put in some wire entanglement finishing about 1 AM. A couple of snipers were about but didn't hit anyone. Put in a bosker low wire. Cold. Took a photo of the dugouts here showing how we live. So as to dodge shrapnel. One lad killed & 3 wounded here on the beach from stray bullets, Everyone is getting careless now & they all stand about in groups on the beach. Mended clothes in the morning. Could hear the tommies & turks fighting in the distance last night & Oh the sound. they, also are having a rough time.\n\nSaturday 1 Mary 1918\n\nEverything going usual so far. We seem to be beating the Turks although we are having a few casualties. Didn't do much all day except go for water & lie down. Did a bit by dishwashing & made things look a bit cleaner. Started to reread some old letters but got called away to fix up for night working (some more entanglements) Had tea & got the section working cutting timbers & getting stores for the night. Went out in front of the firing line & started wire entanglements from where we finished last night to No 3 gun. Almost finished & the covering part sent us back to the trenches as they saw some suspicious character in front. After a while got them out in front again & everything was alright. We had only just started & a couple of shots were fired & we had to return to the trenches again. Lost in the rush a rifle & a maul. We didn't bother to go out again but came back (the moon being too high & showed up our position.\n\nSunday ( 1 After Easter)","119":"\n\nHad a good sleep but we don't get enough in the night. It is too hot in the day to sleep & very cold in the night (A funny mixture). Old James came along to take charge of the section so in the night we left early & went out to finish our entanglements. We went out in front of the trenches and again the covering party were nervous. But we got finished. All the time we were out shots were going extremely close , Too close in fact. Nobody got hit. When we had finished we went back & our sergeant nos. the men off & reported all correct. When we got back to our depot we were 6 men short. Nice way to do things. Anyway the men eventually turned up so everything was alright. We finished early, long before the moon came up so we had a sleep in the night. Quite a change. Our boys tried to push forward in the night but got repulsed but not with too much loss, although there was a good many casualties. The boys in the trenches got a mail but ours hadn't been sorted out yet. Suppose we will get it tomorrow.\n","120":"\n\nFelt much better after having a nights sleep. Slept nearly all the morning. Went down to the store & made hand grenades all day. Finished at 6 PM & had to stand by for night work but it didn't come off. No 3 Section & No 3 Corp are on a sap forming 2 trenches together. The Ships bombarded the port close by all day & we are going to send some men there to move wire entanglements & blow up the post, Went to bed early & had my first nights sleep since being here in Turkey. We are holding the Turks easy now & they think we have thousands of men here in reserve.\n","121":"\n\nSaw of the boys of No 3 Coy. Half our section on hand grenades & I had the others on communication trenches. Had to go to sap head to get instructions & went right thro the firing line. Very narrow & awkward to pass thro. Got sniped at but not hit. Plenty of dead bodies in front of trench & they smell terribly. Just as I left we were sending out a burying party to bury the dead. They did it too. Met Bertie Victorsin & he gave me 3 Gillets blades for safety razor. Got the boys on communications trenches & while digging it dug up a buried Australian & had to bury him again. He was an officer in the 10th Batt but couldn't make out his rank. Poor wretch was swollen a treat & stunk terribly. Put 3 men burying him I had to move away but the boys were smoking & didn't affect them much. We got issued with cigarettes & tobacco today. Still expecting the mail. I reckon it comes tomorrow. Am trying to get 2 cables away home & to MG. I hope they get thro\n","122":"\n\nWent up on the same job for communication trench. Explode fire along the beach from a new battery. \n\nAll mistakes from not entering in, in the right way. All had to hang in close as the fire was pretty strong. The 2nd Brigade moved from here to help the french. Can see a big battle in the distance. Evidently the Tommies. Very cold today. A big change coming. Not much done in the firing line everything very quiet. Sent home the cables.\n","123":"\n\nUp early & had a fresh water wash & washed my towel. Went up to \n\nthe trench. The new battery killed 30 odd mules & a few men on the beach. Our artillery evidently can't be able to locate them. Went for a stroll to No 3 Coy & read the Miner & Truth. then went on to the saps of No 3 Coy. Had a look thru a couple of periscopes & saw a few turks 1200 yds off & were sapping not 600 yds off. They were sapping round to get at the back of the firing line but haven't much hope of doing anything. Not much doing in the firing line. Everything seems very quiet. Hope it isn't as cold tonight as it was last night as it was very cold. A big battle is going on with the Tommies as we can see the shots from our guns blowing up the earth.\n","124":"\n\nOn communication trench all day & in the afternoon went to have a look at firing line. Saw plenty of dead Turks in front & very few Australians. Saw Turks working on their own trenches. Capt Boyce got killed by a bullet. Went out in front of firing line to mark out a trench & got picked off. It was only natural. Very bad week tho. The enemy's guns killed a few men today. Knocked up a couple of guns. Killed an artillery officer. Otherwise things are very quiet in the firing line. Reinforcements arrive today. So we can keep the Turks within bounds now easily. All started to go to bed about 8.30 & got an order for battle order & had to go to firing line & put in a gun near the lines. I had a Squad on a dug out for the officers & it took us till 5 o'clock to finish it. Not much doing in the line. Plenty of firing at nothing at all. Came back to camp & cooked brekky & went to bed thoroughly tired. Too much pick & shovel work.\n","125":"\n\nGot back at 5.30. Had brekker & then went to bed. Slept till 4.30 & shrapnel flying overhead woke me up. Will Bannister came in the morning sometime & had a bit of a yarn with him. He gave me a lot of B.H. news. Got our issue of post cards & shrapnel simply poured over us as I was filling them in. Got 5 & am sending 2 by the mail one home & the other to Madge. Just after filling them in got orders we could go to bed but would have to be prepared to turnout. Lied down & our mail came to light. To say I was delighted isn't in it. Got 4 but couldn't read them on account of the darkness. From Dad, 1 from Chris, Pady & Percy Evans. We slept till 6 then had to go up to the guns & work on the relief digging a sap as a start for a road for another gun. My services weren't required so slept up here while waiting. It was fairly cold but no where near as cold as the night before. Have a very bad stomach. Been out of order for a week & it gives me great pain. Have tried to get out of going to doctor but will have to go soon it is too bad.\n\nRogation","126":"\n\nFinished our job at 5 & go back & had brekky. Dead Turks smelt very much last night. All the letters very interesting specially Percy’s. Sent 2 extra cards to Percy & the other to Madge. Haven't got a letter from Madge this mail yet. Plenty of shrapnel still & good wars news about the Russians. Read a lot of papers & slept in the afternoon. Stomach still very bad, Went & got a new pair of boots & putters. Got a slice of bread & it went very well. Had a yarn with L Avery & a couple of the other boys from No 3 Coy. Went to bed early & had a good sleep. Things still seem the same in the firing line. So we can't help but hold our own.\n","127":"\n\nRained during the night. Had a shave & am now waiting orders for our work today. Northing came to light so we put the day in as best we could. Read & played cards & then we had to go down & unload a cargo of wood. Only took a couple of hours & that was the lot for the day. We had found 2 bagpipes & our boys were tryouts to play them Made weird noises but of course it was very funny. Took 3 of them to play one instrument. Half the section had to go to our depot & await orders but all they did was to sleep. A1. Got a blanket today so ought to be warm now. Also got a letter from dad dated 8th March. Letters are always welcome. Expect some more as haven't received the paper from home or the letter from Madge.\n","128":"\n\nBlanket was warm indeed. We are having a fairly easy time here now. Have to wait for orders still. Had to take 12 men down to Depot to dismantle some barrel piers. Too near dinner so came back & went down after dinner. Only got a letter done when it got too hot with shrapnel & had to leave it. Waited till 4.30 & couldn't do anything so came back to our ' little Grey Home in the West\". No sooner had we got here then they started on our home. I stayed in my dug out for about 10 shots then thought it time to move. Had just gone when next shell burst in my home & scattered all my belongings.. A lot of poor fellows were hit but I escaped without. Quite a lot of our homes were knocked down so we all moved to new quarters. Our rations got mixed up & we couldn't find them. It started to rain about 10 or a little later. The section got another call out for a few hours & had to take the sand bags etc to HQ. & then came back home.\n","129":"\n\nEverything uncomfortable on account of the rain. The majority being wet thro. Our new home suffered but now have fixed it up & is OK. Section gone to finish the barrel piers but the shrapnel has started again so suppose they are all out of the shots. Still raining. Good for our water supply. Fixed up the little house & tried to get down to Depot but had to wait for an hour on account of the heavy shrap. \n\nPoor old Dawkins got killed by the same shrapnel. Shot in 3 places but the serious hit was in the neck. Never spoke after being hit. Got down eventually & went on with the barrel piers while the majority were on a road nearby. 12 men & 4 NCO's were sent to No 3 Section for sapping so I was left here with 10 men. Bought in with a couple of the boys & get good meals. Get plenty to eat always. A days ration consists of about 2 ozs cheese, 1 rasher bacon, 2 potatoes, 8 biscuits. tea, sugar, salt 1 1\/4 lb Jam \n\nWent to see Dawk buried. Cutler seemed broke up a treat. Suppose anybody would too if it was ones pal.\n","130":"\n\nWas very warm. Had about 8 on top of me. 3 men on road, 2 on working the rest in a dug out for a magazine. Bosker weather. Stomach much better. Suppose we will soon get promotions out now. Wrote 2 letters. One home & the other to Madge. Couldn't put too much news on a\/c of censoring. Went on dismounting the barrel piers but had to keep on dodging shrapnel all day.\n\nMr Janus got a promotion from WO to 2nd Leuit. Not much to put in today. Firing line still quiet. Hear heavy bombarding down at the other end. Lost the Goliath there & 3 submarines are out so we will have to watch our shipping now, Got terribly sunburnt but that won't be much.\n","131":"\n\nHad a bosker sleep. Never feel like getting up lately. Very hot. Got a helmet & put in a req for new clothing for my boys. Still on barrel pier & dodging shrapnel. Two of No 1 sections got hit today. Very few casualties now on our side. All our shipping here has moved away & destroyers patrol about. Suppose they are looking for the escaped subs. Very hot today. Had to make the bed while the shrapenl went whizzing by. Everytime I put a blanket down had to bob down or get spotted. The enemy's shells are not good & they are poor shots. Sometimes their shells never bust. In fact I think half of them don't. Hope ours are better. they seem to be when watching the,. Bought a safety razor for 2\/6. Seems A1.\n","132":"\n\nOur boys made an advance and kept the trench they took. Been very hot. Promotions came out but didn't get any. My time will come soon I suppose. Been very hot today. I have been doing the piers again & have been cleaning up the place about here. Had to go to a & have a look at a job they want done. Wanted a plug put in but when got to them for the job it was finished. \n\nPlayed cards in the night.\n\nPlenty of shrapnel flying about again but am still lucky. Thank goodness. Neck seems sore but hope it will be alright. Nothing much doing.\n\nSunday After Ascension","133":"\n\nNo church parade as so of course couldn't go. Wrote a big long letter to Percy Evans. Very hot all day but we kept cleaning up about here. Plenty of shrapnel kicking about but not too many hurt about here. Played cards in the morning & afternoon & again in the night. Played chinese euchre last & it created some good fun for us. Still plenty to eat. We have here with us Indians (mounted battery of artillery), few New Zealand & our boys. We used to have Tommies but weren't much good so we lost them. They went elsewhere. the Tommies here lost ground for us & we had to make it up up again. They were too young & boyish. Had never left home before.\n","134":"\n\nHot again & more dismantling. Spell in the afternoon & went up to firing line to get photos but only got one of the trenches in the firing line. Went to the two saps & had a look. Threw the grappling irons out to drag in a rifle but didn't have any luck. The enemy poured shrapnel into the trench but luckily no one was hit. Got back in time for tea. We started work dismantling at 8 & did some good work. Three of us fell in the water & got slightly wet so we stayed & did the work. Knocked off at 11. The 2nd Brigade came back with only 1500 men from down at the Tommie. They did excellent work while there & that the Tommies are very slow. The RAMC are rotters. Wouldn't give our boys a hand with the stretchers. The Turks have a good position & our people have to take it by seige.\n\nAll our heads have been here lately Birdwood (a geezer) Bridge’s (a bad hit in the groin not expected to get over) & Elliott (a broken arm)\n","135":"\n\nWorked last night dismantling the piers & did good work but it was too dark to finish. Got the day in \non the\n piers & getting clothing. A mail today Only got 7. One each from Mother, Chris, Ed Reiss, Mary Bill Reilly & two from Madge. All very welcome. got new breeches & sox. Took 2 more promotions out Greenway a Leuit (what ho) Larkins SM Neither much good. Went out looking for shells & got 2. Get bread for them from the sailors. Plenty of shells bursting about us while collecting. Seems the usual thing now. Had a look at our new Howitzer. She is a real beauty. Got lime juice tonight. Got a japaddy from the niggers. It is allright. Do me. The Turks put in a good many shots in just at dusk & it looks as if they are going to make an attack tonight. We're always ready for them tho, so they won't get thro the lines\n","136":"\n\nThe enemy made an attack at 1.30 but were repulsed. They came again but were again sent back. We can keep them easily. Got awakened by shells. They were big ones too & did some damage on the beach. James (sapper) got hit in his feet & Haley got hit. Lost a sapper up on the sap. Got hit in the first charge. Wrote to Alex Howlett & would write to more but can't get envelopes so they will have to wait awhile till I get some. The shells the Turks were firing were 9.5\". Pretty large considering. Had a good old talk to Shipp & McKee till 12 o'clock. Went to bed & slept well. Sapper lost was Matthews a reinforcement lad. Rained shrapnel & lydite all day. Didn't get a moments peace till late in the night. Went for a stroll just after tea & took a photo of the natives quarters in a hill. Picked up a few shells. Might get some mungary for it. Got some more japaddy from the indians.\n\nA few Turkish & German Officers brought in prisoners.\n","137":"\n\nStill plenty of firing during the night but not as heavy as last night. ?Not much shrapnel so far (11.30). A german aeroplane was overhead about 10 this morning. Some shots were fired at it but didn't hit it. An indian was pretty badly hit close by his dug out by shrapnel. Poor Indian died as soon as he reached the AMC depot. things are much quieter. Went for a walk just after dinner round the hill & picked up the rear end of a 12\" shell fired yesterday by the Turks. Stood up to take a photo of the hills & a shell bursting on the crest but a Turk saw me & fired a couple of shots. Very close but I got the photo in the 2nd attempt. Order just came out for everyone to stand to arms (No exceptions) Turks are flying the white flag evidently to bury their dead. They lost very heavily during their recent attacks. Took a snap of 8 Turks (prisoners) carrying timber today. When making & eating tea shrapnel must interrupt everything again. It's a nuisance. The Turks flew white flags all along the Trenchline evidently to bury the dead. The Turks didn't play fair so we started then to put shots into them. Another battle going on now. Plenty of our guns working the Turks about. The Turks seem to be the only ones .\n","138":"\n\nQuiet again today except for an occasional shell worked about the beach. On Kaba Tepe the Turks flew a white flag & a little later we sent a party out with the interpreter to bring them in. They are coming along the beach now. Plenty of guns firing both here & down at Helles Point last night, Went down after dinner & met the party coming in. Two of our officers brought 1 man in blindfolded. He was either a Staff Colonel or a General & distinctly a German. Took his photo anyway whether he liked it or not. He was very well groomed & rode a horse at the start. The firing line seems very quiet today only an occasional shot. Same with the shrapnel. The Turks must get good information as a boat came in this morning with some 10\" ammunition & got driven out by the Turks shooting. They fired about a dozen shots & just missed her every time. Triumph went away today, a Jap taking her place for a while. Went up to the firing line for a stroll & saw a good many dead Turks.. On the way up some of the boys were sorting out Turkish rifles from ours so got a bayonet from them. Saw two dead Turks who had tried to cut our wire entanglements on the right flank. They didn't succeed but were shot for their pains. Haven't heard any talk about this German Officer yet.\n","139":"\n\nA most disagreeable day. Started to rain about 5 & had to get up early. Couldn't be bothered cooking meat but only had biscuits & jam & a cup of tea for brekker. Worked the same as usual all day. the alleged German was a Turkish general & returned to his lines after having been on one of the warships. He came again today & returned at night. Suppose some peace designs. Anyway the fighting goes on just the same. While away in the morning our little Grey Home got knocked down by a shell so had to mend it again. (Mis Chrise no good to us). Rained on & off all day & made the place very muddy. The Bracchante sighted the Turkish submarines, all our shipping cleared. The cruisers & destroyers careered about in circles for a couple of hours. Suppose the subs either went or couldn't be found. Tried to order some photographic gear & writing material but the boat didn't go out so will write to Cpl. Gilbert & ask him to order it at Alexandria. Not very much shrapnel on the beach today. Just a little. Played cards again. Chinese euchre created a lot of fun for a while\n","140":"\n\nDoesn't seem like Sunday here. Still a little shrapnel on the beach & plenty of rifle fire going on in the trenches. A mail came & got 6 bosker letters. One each from Mother, Madge, Chris, Aunt Ett, Geo A & Ed Reiss. Also got an Observer & chronicle from Madge. Just at tea time Chas Sheppard got hit in the foot & had to go on the boat. Found out the Turkish Officer s name it is Bimbasrikerral Bey. He is from Essad. Pasha the Turkish Commander in Chief. Enemy's aeroplane overhead today & dropped a couple of bombs. Getting plenty to do now. We have the Turks well in hand & by all a\/c Italy & Roumania are going to buy in. Reports say that the 77 Reg (Arabs) were very frightened of us & that they fired their rifles in any fashion & wounded 500 of their own men. Reports also say that the Turkish papers say they don't know exactly what we are but evidently we are blacks from Africa & Australia & are cannibals. It is the first time they have been attacked by cannibals\n\nWhitsun","141":"\n\nAn armastice from 7 am till 4 P.M. was real decent. Very quiet. Just like a Sunday at Home. Made myself a bosker home instead of going to the firing line & getting photo. Took a photo of a good many from the firing line, in bathing. Has a bosker swim without any fear of being hit by shrapnel. Had Avery to tea. Plenty of Turkish rifles & ammunition brought into DHQ. Also a few of ours. Wouldn't mind an armistice every day. After 4 had to go & make hand grenades till it was too dark to see. Early in the morning before the armistice the Altron went round to Kaba Tepe & the Turks shelled her. She got a couple of their big guns tho & did more damage to them. She got off alright after a while. The Turkish dead was astonishing. More there than we had estimated. They seemed too frightened to shoot for a long time after 4. Didn't start till about 5. Plenty of bombarding down at Helles Point all day.\n\nWhitsun Tuesday 25 May 1915\n\nWasn't too much doing last night. Only a few shots came down. A little bit of firing by the Turks. Looks as if they are very frightened. Think they will soon give in. Just after writing this a castastrophe came in sight. At 1\/4 to 1 the Triumph was hit by a torpedo from a Turkish sub & sank in 11 minutes. A big column of water shot up first then she gradually came over on the side nearest us & went down. The Keel alone showing for 9 minutes. She disappeared altogether from the hit to the end in 20 minutes. they only lost about 25 men tho thank goodness & we heard later that the sub was caught. When she started to go down all the pinnaces from here went to her assistance & while the rescue workers on the Turks fired on them. Will get our revenge tho. Made grenades in the afternoon & again in the night. cut off 6 lengths of 7\" pipe with a hack saw. Something like old times.\n","142":"\n\nItaly has declared war & is fighting Austria. Think this lot will soon end as the Turks only seem half hearted now since the armastice. Not much shrapnel now. Very little. Making grenades still. No news about the Triumph yet. Plenty of fighting early in the evening & kept going all through the night. Very little shrapnel all day altho while trying to land troops the boats got plenty & had to go out again till dusk. 4th Reinforcements landed & Infantry of","143":" Reinforcements (4 men only) for Engrs. Besides these a few wounded & sick came back. They all seemed to have heard the news from here before coming. Major Martyn heard about McKee & myself getting a photo & being shot at, the other day & I believe he went off some. Engrs now are not allowed to fire in the firing line or look out ofloopholes. Just like little barrack room soldiers, We have to be looked after as we are losing too many\n","144":"\n\nThings very quiet today. The Majestic was lost at Point Helles. By the same sub who got the Triumph. No good. No shrapnel at all today here on the beach but they are getting it in the trenches. The enemy must be running short of munition. Still plenty of work here at he depot. Going out to tea today. Going up to our HQ to dine with Mac. Went out but only had a cup of tea, biscuits & jam. Came home again & had a supper. Steak & onions. Not bad for a supper on active Service. Heard that Strang & Davis were both buried when the Armistice was on. Things a little bit active in the night. This mostly by the Turks firing. As a rule our boys fire very seldom in the night & the Turks seem frightened & fire in big volleys & these seem down here to us as if there was a charge on. Very little shrapnel all day but the couple of shots that did come wounded 2 men pretty badly. The Majestic was reported sunk by a torpedo from the Turkish Sub today So the subs are doing some damage to us.\n","145":"\n\nPlenty of shrapnel this morning immediately after breakfast. Not much damage done. Shrapnel quietened off & work went on as usual. Worked on grenades & off jobs about the camp. Brought up a lot of stores from one of our old depots. Was going to post letters as the mail closes Fridays & Mondays. Put the letters in & mail came to hand but nothing came for me until in the afternoon. Got 6 then. One each from Mother, Dad, Madge, Eva, Mary & Doris Bolton. A couple were funny but nevertheless were all very welcome. Can answer the letters in the ones I didn't post (Shrewd). Plenty of shooting again just as we went to bed. Its a great habit of the Turks.\n","146":"\n\nThe Turks made an attack & got one of our trenches on the left. Whether they held it or not we don't know yet. Plenty of shrapnel flying about here in the night but never woke up so missed it all. Wrote a couple of letters in answers to some I received yesterday. Still at hand grenades. Tested a couple just to see if they were still alright & they went well. Colonel Levinia came down just before tea & we are going to get 8 inf men to cut up shrapnel & all we do now is to finish the grenades. We have a real factory now. Will be able to start a business soon as a Bomb Manufacturer. Read an account of our landing in an English paper \"The People\". Gives us all a fair name. Very hot here now. Had to work all night on hand grenades. Had 6 New Zealanders helping us.\n","147":"\n\nKnocked off at 4 o'clock. Slept all the morning but got up for brekker. Started work at 2 again on grenades. Worked till 10.30 on the, & made about 250. Pretty good going. We are supposed to have taken 2 trenches & 3 Machine guns. The Tommies are also supposed to have taken Atsi Babtars Ridge. We all hope so. The Turks have had 55,000 casualties since the scrap here. It has now been found out we landed against 120,000 Turks. The Asiatics coming over this side as well. the 1873 Quota are now called out so this thing cannot last too long. We won't be sorry as we all want a fresh move. Nice thing to be making bombs when the people on the other side of the world are going to church. Seemed to be another attack of some description last night. Turks trying to regain their old trench I suppose.\n","148":"\n\nBosker day, but is going to be hot. Still on the bomb manufacturing job. Started organising the men & got shifts going. Got 21 men from 8th Batt & have about 22 Engrs. Will be able to turn out a few now. Lets hope they do a great deal of damage. Stayed up till 1 AM & saw the shift on & then went well into bed.\n\nNo very much firing last night. Our trench at Quinn's Post is only 8 yds from the Turks trench. The Turks mined against us & we blew up two of their mines & they blew up one out of three. We lost the trench & then regained it at the point of the bayonet a couple of nights ago & now we are making a T head at the end of the their sap leaving the T only 8 yds from their trench. These grenades of ours have played a great part in Quinns Post.\n","149":"\n\nStill going strong on grenades. Made 375 yesterday & this morning have made 100 more. We have N.Z. No 1 Coy & No 2 Coy Engrs on the grenades. the Inf. are digging a new home for us. Capt. Waite made a D.S.O. for gallant work with RMLI a little while ago. A few more promotions have come out & have got a Sergeant in N.Z. Section. They haven't been yet approved so am not a sergeant yet. A new grenade came to light. A rifle grenade so will have some fitting up to do with them. Only a little bit of shrapnel all day. Some in the morning & in the afternoon. Went to bed at 10 to make up for the other nights\n\nPlenty of work still. Run out of detonators, so moved up to our new position. More detonators came to light so went on making grenades again. Went down in the night & pinched timber & chesses for our new factory. Nothing much doing in the firing line. Things seem very quiet there for a while. Just as we were going to bed the Jap Mortar fired & that started the Turks going again. They always seem to start immediately the mortar fires. Evidently they think it a signal for themselves.\n","150":"\n\nThings going well. New factory going. Put up the chesses & Military Police wanted to know where we got them. After over an hours argument had to return them & have now boxes & wire netting as overhead cover. A big argument \n was over \n between Col. Lotbiner & our QM resulted in the HQ here being sacked. Saw it all & was very funny. Our No 4 Section boys killed in firing line while putting up loop holes. Poor kid. His name was Harold Baster. Supposed to be some big ructions in the night but it was postponed till tomorrow night. Getting our little home together gradually.\n","151":"\n\nFixing up our happy home for grenades all the morning. Didn't make any more grenades over the morning. Fixed up a number of souveniers for home but changed my mind about sending the things home. Am going to take them home myself ( ie. if I get home) Plenty of shooting down below at Helles. We heard that the big Hill Ally Barber was captured by us. Also 2000 prisoners taken. Don't know whether its true or not.\n\nPromotions confirmed & have to go to No 2 Section under Greenway. We made an attack during the night. Used 3 slabs of guncotton on a stick as a grenade. Ought to do some damage. Our bomb factory finished & looks A1. Will take a snap of it soon.\n","152":"\n\nStarted on the factory again & made a lot more improvements on it. Our boys attacked at Quinns Post during the night & captured the 300 yds of the Turks trench. Lost it in the morning on a\/c of the Turks bombs. The NZ officers lost heavily. Lost 6. Made 207 bombs today besides making improvements. Have to report to Major Martyn for duty as he wants me. Capt. Waite & Col Lotbiner both tried to keep me & have to report still. Major Mozley (the new colonel in Elliots place) has given me 3 days. Am keeping the note Capt Waite gave me. Saw Martyn \n\n& he didn't seem to like the note so have to go in 3 days. Heard that at Atchy Barber the Tommies got 2000 pris had surrounded 3,500 & the turkish casualties were 15,000. Also that the Turkish Ambassador had gone to England to arrange for peace\n\nSunday (1 After Trinity)","153":"\n\nUp at factory early with Capt Waite. Col. Lotbinier & Lt Anderson also came up & had a look about. Did some testing & have to make 500 dummies for practice purposes. Put 10 Inf on the afternoon shift & let them work till 10 PM Sap Wingrove (No 3 Coy) has been put in close custody as a spy. Don't know where it is true or not. The Zeppelins seem to be having a good time in England.\n","154":"\n\nPlenty of work still, making grenades. Supposed to be have been an attack by the Turks during the night but it didn't come off. Our bomb department didn't suffer then. Took the day shifts photo with different types of bombs in their hands. Still very hot here. The flies being a great nuisance. There is supposed to be a few cases of typhoid & other diseases from our sanitary conditions. The conditions are not good at all. Could be greatly improved. Hope it soon is too. Too much tins & rubbish knocking about altogether.\n","155":"\n\nMy time up here today but Col Lotbinier has sent a note to Sturdie so very likely will stay on. Very hot & flies are getting more troublesome every day. Not very much shrapnel all day altho during the night the colonel came up for bombs of the two types for some work in the night but by all accounts they didn't attack so very likely didn't use the bombs. Haven't seen any aeroplanes about lately. One of the new monitors (flat bottomed cruiser drawing about 4 feet water & has 2-6\", 1- 9\" & and a anti aircraft gun). She fired a few shots & stirred things up a bit.\n","156":"\n\nHave to stay at factory for a while yet. Do me. So started renovations here. Got a magazine put in & other sundry items. Have a big stock in now. Close on 2000. News started again & we are doing well by all a\/c. These flies drive one silly. Wish we could get some fly paper or something to move them away from here. Hope this scrap is soon over. We could all do with a spell & England would go well.\n","157":"\n\nWhile renovating Colonel Lotbinier brought General Birdwood up to have a look at our home. He asked a few questions about the bombs. We don't seem to be able to get Quinns Post. Have taken it a few times & have always lost it. Lets hope next time we take it we keep it. Still very hot & flies damn troublesome. Very funny. Mr Shrapnel has been very quiet lately & he started again today. instead of shrapnel tho it was lyddite & aimed at the dug outs (very close to mine too). Well a lot hit the dug outs & after every shot 2 or 3 would run out of the dug out shot at & a crowd collected on the shore (in safe (posys) would laugh a treat. It was very funny watching & by good luck nobody was hit.\n","158":"\n\nA bit windy this morning & a little bit of dust. Still warm tho & the flies as big a nuisance as ever. Finished all our detonators so did some repair work to the factory. Dusty a good part of the day. A little shrapnel & big Jack Johnsons flying about. But nobody seemed to be hit. Still very hot. Hope we soon beat the Turks & get away from here\n","159":"\n\nStill a very decent sort of a fight. Very little shrapnel, till just after dinner when she started again. Sergeant Hillier was killed by shrapnel just before dinner near the right flank on a new road. Seems terrible. One can hardly realize that the poor boy is dead. He used to be my sergeant & now he is gone. Went up for our mail & got some razor blades & 2 papers from Alice Grat. Hope every body is doing well home. Had some navy cocoa & drank it out of a time here. Went A1.\n\nSunday (2 After Trinity)","160":"\n\nHad bad pains & seemed to be poisoning. got up early & got over it by dinner time. The Euryalus & Yarmouth woke everyone up by their heavy bombardment of the Turks position. Euryalus bombarded Kaba Tepe & the right flank & Yarmouth bombarded the left flank. The destroyers kept guard over both ships but they only stayed for a couple of hours & then went back to Lemnos. Got bread issued to us today. 1\/2 loaf each. Got 2 letters one from Will Riley & the other from Hunter Elt. Will Riley sent over 7 Gilette blades in the letter but two were broken so got them put in the grenades. An aeroplane came over just as we were having tea & dropped 3 bombs down on the Turks. They shot at it & went very close to her but didn't hit it. They started shrapnel again just before tea but did little damage.\n","161":"\n\nMr Shrapnel woke us up this morning. Did some damage to the hill behind us & killed 3. No good. Lt General Godley came & had a look at the bomb factory. Gave him an insight into everything. Its marvellous how little all the heads know about bombs & explosives. Our boys caught a big fish last night & we ate it for brekker this morning. Was real bosker. We threw some explosives in & it evidently stunned the fish. Do me again anyway. The sea is a bit rough today. Was very funny tonight. One of our destroyers has a duel with a land gun from the olive groves on the right flank. Don't think either hurt one another tho. Am anxiously waiting for my mail.\n","162":"\n\nVery quiet all day. Sea very high up on beach & was real bosker in swimming. Two planes up today & the Monitor fired a few shots & did a bit of damage. The french got a couple of trenches at Ache Baba. Hope they soon take it all. The Turks shots at the planes were very close, but didn't hit them. Mr Shrapnel woke up again at tea time & killed 2 donkeys & wounded an Indian. A few barrels of wine washed ashore from the Triumph & some artillery rushed down with fixed bayonets & captured them. Made a couple of bomb carriers for Gen Godley. Hasn't seen them yet (for the simple reason that he went over to Imbros).\n","163":"\n\nPlenty of shrapnel all day long & a few men killed & wounded. Put in an application for an Imperial Commission. Hope I get it. It seems a pretty good thing. Our food supply seems to be getting shorter instead of better. Don't get enough sugar for our tea & cheese is poor & other articles of a similar nature. Very funny this morning the boys who drank the wine last night all had sore heads today. Real funny sights they were too some of them.\n","164":"\n\nWeather still very warm & flies a nuisance. Washed my shirt today. Gave it a breather. Use it for both shirt & singlet & at present am using a sweater for both. Its rotten to be poor like this, Plane went up as we were having tea & dropped 2 bombs near Kaba Tepe. Made plenty of row & dust but don't know whether any damage or not. Threw a bomb in the sea & then went in looking for fish but could only get very small ones. They weren't worth keeping so let the things go again. Col. Lotbinier has been promoted to General. Just before going home to bed the bombs were taken out & a mule bolted dropped 7 bombs & didn't explode any, thank goodness. Mule kilckedd an Indian on the block. Hurt him a bit.\n","165":"\n\nHad to make a wooden belt for carrying bombs to Gen Godley's & Real Rotten idea too. Tried a few experiments with ballistite & cordite, Tried to fix up a charge for Actovating ammonial without a detonator. Don't think it will be successful. Bulgaria seems to be declaring war. Hope she does. Greece ought to also. Went to bed at 10 & just got in when the Turks right flank gun sent down a few shots & made things very uncomfortable for everyone within its range. A shell went thro a roof of a dugout & burst inside & only wounded 3 men out of 5 in it. They were very lucky indeed. We have used 5 good rounds of ammunition without the lot we've pinched. Must have used altogether over 70000.\n","166":"\n\nA few more shots today. Out of detonators so very little work done. Haven't heard anything about my applic. yet. Suppose I will today. Mail has been expected for the last 3 days. It is always the chief topic here. Was waiting for mail & went outside to see if it was coming down from our HQ & a shot came over. the other chap got into the shelter but I would have moved to late. It came down so unexpected. Didn't give any warning. Just stood still & the shot burst all round me. Do me for luck. Got one letter to finish up with from Madge. Expect some more.\n\nSunday (3 After Trinity)","167":"\n\nStill no detonators. Had a couple of tests with guncotton in the morning. Plenty of shrapnel about all day. Three of No 1 Coy got killed yesterday in the evening Commissions not for NZ or Aus as we had our chance in Egypt. Very hot still. Got a copy of a Turkish Officers diary. Seems fairly interesting. This war looks as if it is going to last a long time. Greece cannot declare till 20th July. Got 2 letters one from Mary & another from home. Plenty of bombarding down at Helles\n","168":"\n\nBombarding going on all day. Wrote home & to Madge. A mail came in & got a pair of sox from home. Had fish for dinner & got a bone stuck in my throat. Couldn't get it out so went to a doctor & he tried & made me sick a few times. He moved it but couldn't get it out as of course it has to stick there. Its very sore too but suppose it will be A1 tomorrow. Tried to write a letter but couldn't put my mind to it so left it for a while.\n","169":"\n\nDetonators came so we could start on the grenades again. Took a Japanese bomb to pieces & the high explosives they use colored hands & left a nasty taste in the mouth. Leaves a yellow stain. The shell will make a bosker ash tray. Plenty of shrapnel going into the water but coming very close to the factory. French captured 2 lines of trenches at Helles yesterday. They kept it too. Turks counter attack about 6 times but the froggies beat the, back. A Zeppelin flew over last night about 3 am. In consequence all fires & lights to be out at 9 o'clock. Went in for a swim & went to bed. Got called at 10.30 for some guncotton bombs. Sent some one up for them & turned over to sleep.\n","170":"\n\nA lot of shells today. Went into the armoury & knocked about some armour. 2 of the beach party killed at our depot. Went to doctor with throat but he couldn't do anything for it. It is very sore too, today. Am trying hard to get a factory started in Egypt. Ought to have a good job then. Seem to have a good chance of getting it. We have a percussion bomb for trial & it ought to work the oracle. \nA couple of boys were killed by shrapnel at the Depot\n. My word it is a real death hole. Still very hot & flies as big a nuisance as ever.\n","171":"\n\nHave had plenty of swimming lately. 2 a day. Plenty of shrapnel about all. 18 hit in one shot & killed. 6 in another & 4 in another. No good to us. The Turks are making up for all their had shooting. Some Scotchmen landed today with 5 Howitzers. Took a snap of the (How is it's) Ought to come out alright. Am anxiously waiting for spools for Kamera & some I sent over to Egypt to be developed. Got a surprise. Was told there was a registered parcel for me at DW. Engrs Went over & it was a pair of sox from mother. Real boskers too.\n","172":"\n\nPlenty of shrapnel about still. A howitzer this time & the shells are bursting real well now. Went up in for a dip & then to factory. Went thro a couple of shots & when I got to factory went in came out again to see about water for a shave & a shell burst a good way off & I stopped apiece of it. Only bruised me on the left ear. Col Lotbinier came back in the evening & brought some types of bombs. Seem to be O.K. Stayed till 11 at factory & made everythin hustle as 850 bombs were taken from factory in 2 nights & had to keep things going to catch up. Mail in & got 6 letters. All back mail 2 each from home & Madge 1 from Bruce Sloan & the other from Mabel.\n","173":"\n\nPlenty of shrapnel about. Quite a common complaint now. Went in for a dip & got a fish. It was killed by the explosion earlier in the morning. Altogether we got 13 fish & had fish for dinner. Didn't stop any bones today. Ribs not sore from hit. Col Pridham & Capt Waite had a look at the bombs from the different ships. None much good. Ours much better. Shrapnel has found our posy here now. My word the shrapnel has made cowards of us all. Makes us all dive in for dugouts & everything else in that line. The notes the Turkish aeroplane dropped said that we hadn't made much impression on them & that we were forced to fight. That we should surrender & that they had plenty of food for us at Constantin. Also that our boats could come here on a\/c of their submarines. The will do us but would rather it was over.\n\nSunday (4 After Trinity)","174":"\n\nSunday again & the Turks opened it with plenty of rifle fire & shrapnel early in the morning. Heard a church service but we still have to work every day without any difference in each day. The shrapnel killed a couple. Blew them to pieces, arms legs etc all over the place. Made a terrible mess. Had eggs for tea. One of the AMC boys gave me three for tea & as I was going home gave me 6 more. He is a real sport.A fish shall certainly go to him in future from our catching.\n","175":"\n\nBosker morning. Real lovely in the water. Very quiet our end but at Helles they are trying to take a ridge & by looks from here are succeeding. A fleet has just come in sight (9.30) so everything looks as if we are actually making our start forward to . A rumour says we are. Everybody hopes so. Too monotonous in the one place so long. We charged to stir up the reinforcements for the Turks at Achi Baba. Took 3 trenches & cut them up pretty badly. We had a good many casualties. Some Scotchmen were supposed to have landed between here & Achi Baba & we hope to connect up right thro. Hope it is all true. Got a big haul of fish with a bomb. Some real beauties too.\n","176":"\n\nReal bosker morning. Still some bombardment down below. Looks as if they succeeded. All hope they did. They took 5 trenches at Helles & got more than they had hoped for. Eggs for tea again. These came from a Turkish transport captured in the Straights. A big sea came up & a pinnace towing a barge load of wounded broke a 2 ½\" steel cable & the wounded were washed into the beach. No damage done but a terrible lot of inconvenience to them all. The Turks blew up a sap of ours during the night & 2 sappers got killed. Sappers Weekes & Rogash, Lt Knight & Sapper Lobb got the effects of the gas & were knocked out for a while. Rotten luck. we seem to having a bad time in many respects, Have had 5 killed now. Hope there isn't any more.\n","177":"\n\nStill very rough sea but it makes a real bosker swim. Some troops landed in small batches. Every time they would come in the shrapnel would start. Two or three were killed again on the beach by the shrapnel. A storm came up. Plenty of thunder & lightening but only a little bit of rain. Was very heavy for a start. Turks did a bit of firing in the night but it seemed as if they were frightened.\n","178":"\n\nSoon hot again after the rain. Very quiet so far but I suppose it will soon start again. Gen. Lotbinier came back last night. A bit of a wind came up & has made it a little bit rough again. Didn't go back to work again after tea. Didn't feel too well. Read Daily Mirror till 10. Had a hair cut & felt a bit lighter afterwards.\n","179":"\n\nHad to get 50 batts made for bomb carrier's The idea isn't too good but still one has to do as one's told in these days. It rained during the night & made things a bit muddy. Nothing much doing all day. Still short of detonators & the stack of bombs is getting short.\n\nSaturday 2 July 1915\n\nRained as I got up but it quietened the sea & made it very smooth for a swim. Rained for about an hour. Some detonators came also some double cylinder grenades so will now have some bombs in stock. Had a chat with Frank Gentle. Went to see Lt Col. Bennett & had a good old chat with him about things here & at home. Got a few envelopes from him. Went & had a look at the tunnels in his command. The whole lot are almost completed now. As soon as they are they will break thro the roof & have a new firing line right along. Rather a shrewd idea.\n","180":" (5 After Trinity)","181":"\n\nWrote 3 letters home, Madge & Aunt Maggie. Real bosker day. Nice & cool on account of the breeze coming from the sea. A big explosion at Achi Baba this morning. Don't know whether it was ours or theirs. We didn't get Young Rogasch out. Have left him buried there. A man at Helles was shot by count martial for leaving his post as a sentry. Another was ordered to be shot for showing cowardice to the enemy. Got it altered to 10 years penal servitude. Doing things here now. Finishing the last of my boyhood days.\n","182":"\n\nMy 21st birthday. Have now entered the manhood stage now. A big 11.2\" naval gun has started firing this morning. Hasn't done much damage, the majority of the shots going in the water. One man was killed by all their shooting. They put in, in all about 20 shots. Had a read of some papers but really want more reading. It gets monotous here occasionally. Water calmed down beautifully.\n","183":"\n\nWater bosker this morning. The boys got a couple of fish so am having fish for dinner. Went OK. A big rumour knocking about that Ian Hamilton has been recalled on account of being too slow here. Also that 15000 men are landing tonight. Don’t think any of them are true. The mine sweepers are laying a net right across from the two islands to Helles so that 40 cruisers can come in & bombard the place. We are supposed to be in Constan. by the end of August. It will mean a tremendous amount of work if we do. 400 bombs were sent back as being no good. Went over them all & there wasn't one defective. Sent them all back in the night. Examined tested them all. Threw 3 or 4 into the sea & took a good many to see everything was OK.\n","184":"\n\nThe wild rumors of yesterday wee wrong as no troops landed during the night. Am going to have a tooth filled & stopped at 11 this morning. Was busy all day. Plenty of shrapnel 5 men wounded & a couple killed. Had tooth filled with porcelain. Still very sore but it seems to be easing. Worked till 12 & I actually worked. 250 more bombs sent back. Will make a bog row over this lot. Seems a case of petty spite.\n","185":"\n\nGot to work at 10. Always seem to have somebody waiting for me every morning. Have a big stock of detonators 6000 & 2000 bombs already made. Beat the depot for the alts & fuse. The officer in charge didn't seem to like the idea of losing the dets. Received my photos from Egypt & they were OK. Real good results. A smoke appeared on the water. It appears that we are using nets & they are running by electricity. When anything else strikes the net it upsets & makes a smoke in daytime & a light by night. The returned bombs were all OK so sent them back tonight. Have sent out 5325 in 15 nights. Average 355 per night. Sgt. Donaldson got hit tonight. The engineers posy got fired at pretty often.\n","186":"\n\nGetting very hot again. The flies are more troublesome than ever. A big tank level has been dug just behind the bomb factory & 2 lines of pipes are going to be run alongside this place. Plenty of rifle fire & a lot of grenades went off last night. They are all using plenty of grenades. Got my photos back from Egypt yesterday & the majority of the views were OK. Not much doing here all day.\n","187":"\n\nGot 4 spools from Egypt sent over by Chas Sheppard. Went for a stroll to get some views but didn't see anything to take. Got fired at a couple of times: went close but that's all. Have a bit of a head ache & sore throat, but not much. A big cruiser (more like a dreadnought) did a lot of firing this afternoon. The Turks put plenty of shots into her but I suppose the damage they did wasn't much. The gun boat put the shots into a big hill on the right of our right flank. Bulgaria & Roumania declared war on Turkey today so perhaps this place will soon fall now. Another cruiser came in & put a lot of shots in. Destroying cement gun emplacements. The aeroplane had a tremendous lot of luck. Plenty of shots just missing her.\n","188":"\n\nVery quiet all day altho early in the morning the monitor did a lot of shooting. Sea plane was up giving her the range etc. Very hot today & am perspiring a lot on account of my cold. Seems a little better today. Sapper Sheppard got his head blown off last night & about 8 of the boys were wounded. Turks shelled their dugouts. The Turks blew in 3 tunnels last night & did some damage. Killed 20 & about 14 wounded besides blowing up some of our trenches. Busy today taking in more explosives etc. A mail in so expect a few letters. Got 2 papers from Alex G that was all. The letters are expected tomorrow. The Doris came up & put in a few salvos. Just in front of the trenches. Blew things up a bit. We captured a trench about 10 o'clock. Plenty of work being done below. Our guns are firing down there. Set a patch on fire. Hope this means a start forward.\n","189":"\n\nThe Turks have counter attacked as there is plenty of rifle fire & the artillery seem to be having plenty of exercise. Still pretty hot. Another mail in so might get some of my letters. Got 5 letters 2 from Madge 1 each from Mother Ed Russ. & Marj. Also got a pocket book from Madge was real bosker. Plenty of shooting today both at Helles & here. They got 3 lines of trenches at Helles. They ought to get up here soon. Plenty of bombs going out. Too many in fact for us. We have to put more men on here soon.\n","190":"\n\nFather's birthday. Hope he is quite well. Wrote letters but got interrupted so often that I don't know exactly what I wrote in them. Got brought up early from dinner as had to send 600 bombs to Cape Helles. Will be real good job if we have to make bombs for them as well. Jim Hardingham came up to see me. Old Doc wished to be remembered to me. Made a big rush on. Made 420 in one shift & caught things up easily.\n","191":"\n\nGot a letter from Wally Leckie. Plenty of work this morning. A lot of bombs came in from Egypt & I have to stock them. Have to fill some & some are filled. Have plenty to do now. Just at dusk a shot came over from the right & cut 3 boys up. One had 2 legs blown off & another his foot & the 3rd got a cut in the back of the neck. The shot got in amongst about 20 of them on a barge. All swimming about. A plane went over at tea time & dropped a bomb over the Turks lines.\n","192":"\n\nCold not much better yet. Two planes over & the Turks put a lot of shots at them. Too busy to write again all day. Renovating the office here. Getting things ready for a big stock. Tried to pinch 2 aixus but couldn't because the sentry wouldn't move away. Got some timber for a cook house & also some for a dugout.\n","193":"\n\nMore howitzers came this morning & some more are going to land in due course. Still have a bad cold. Finished renovating. Very hot. Get a terrible sweat up every time I do any work at all. Billy McGrath came to see me. Very hot all day. Took out 750 bombs. More work for tomorrow. Our cook started today & isn't too bad.\n","194":"\n\nA Taube flew overhead & dropped 2 bombs very close to my dug out. Came over about 6 o'clock this morning. Plenty of heat still. Had to take one of the bombs to pieces. It was made of picric acid & in a brass pear shaped cover. Took 3 other round Turkish bombs to pieces for some of the heads. Having a dug out built up here now. Went to the dentist but my teeth are OK. Broke the glass of my watch at wrestling. Bad luck that.\n\nSunday (7 After Trinity)","195":"\n\nRather awkward without the watch. Chas Sheppard came back this morning. Had to clean up for a meeting of the heads. It was about respirators. Didn't learn much. Got a mail 4 letters & a parcel from Alice G. Good oh. Some shells came unpleasantly close. Getting a dug out built up here. Will move into tomorrow. Very hot again. Always get wet thro from sweat. Soon want a new singlet or a shirt. Worked until 11.\n","196":"\n\nAnother big mail in so ought to get some out of it. Still very hot. Cold is still bad too\n\nLotbinier came up to see how things were going. Made a new fence around the factory. Took a snap of the men pulling the tanks up the hill into position for the water supply. Got a bosker letter from Bill Reilly. Must go back & see him someday. 3 planes of ours up at the same time tonight one dropped a bomb & made a terrific thud.\n","197":"\n\nAnother plane up this morning & she dropped another bomb. Greece is supposed to declare today. Made a stretcher or rather had it made. A big argument all day on unions. One man not in one & nobody can tell him anything about a union. Big bombardment going on at Helles. A sniper had a machine gun trained on the beach. got moved today by shrapnel.\n\nWednesday 21 July 1915\n\nYoung Clairs 3rd birthday. Had a bosker sleep on the bed last night. Made the dugout a little wider. Got inoculated on the arm for cholera. The average for the last month (28 days) of bombs sent out is 429","198":" per night. Pretty large considerings. Have pretty big stock in too at present. Must be going to have an attack by the Turks as we are sending out tonight 1850 hand Grenades & 31 Lotbiniere. Also sent out last night 900 so the factory must evidently be paying. Ought soon to pay a Aivry. A gun boat & a monitor have been cruising about all the afternoon & tonight put in a lot of shots. Do us. The cruiser looked like a dummy at first but soon showed that she wasn't. Wrote to Bill R. & Doris Bolten\n","199":"\n\nTurks Christmas Day today. Plenty of ammunition went out last night. Over 300,000 rounds of 18 pounder besides the munition for howitzers & rifles. Tested 3 bombs & only got 1 fish out of it. Had to send out another 900 again today & had to put on both shifts at night too get up a stock. Worked till just after 12. We expect a big attack tonight but don't suppose it will come off\n","200":"\n\nDidn't start the day shift till 11 oclock. Made some more improvements in the shop by putting in some shelves. A big argument all day over Australia & England. Over the war & what both countries had done etc. Every body's opinion differed. Had a meat pie brought over to me. Went OK. Got 3 letters & a paper from home., Madge & Marj & from Alice G. Had a sweat up all day over work. Quite something unusual. Some new bombs in & a few aren't worth anything at all. That German plane that came over here the other day got caught at Helles. He went over to Imbros dropped 2 bombs alongside two monitors. Nearly hit them too. Went inland & dropped another. Then came over here dropped 3 here & then went to Helles. Two Frenchmen went up & chased him & brought him down. Good oh.\n","201":"\n\nEverything going OK till about 11 when old Elliott came over. Caught one man smoking & told him off. Turned on me & told me he wouldn't have me in his company even as a bugler. Trying to make trouble I think. I thanked him for the insight & he remarked don't thank me. Tested some more bombs with fair results. Elliott got one man sent away & sent a note to Waite saying I was untrustworthy. He is one of the sort who deserve to get shot.\n\nSunday (8 After Trinity)","202":"\n\nVery hot again. Wrote 4 letters & did a little bit of sewing. Plenty of shells kicking about. A couple came very close to our factory. Told Waite about Elliott & by all appearances if he says I have to go, well its finish. Made some bread & milk for supper was real good. Poor Mirams is going right off his rocker. Has a marching order parade at 7 o'clock in the morning.\n","203":"\n\nTired Too lazy to get up for a swim. Putting plenty of bombs out. Chris Shepp came up. Had his dinner here & had a good old talk with him. There are real ragtime in the coy. A lot of shells bursting very close to the factory. Still very hot. Only 1100 bombs out last night. Looks as if we are feeding the Turks on bombs or else supplying them as well as ourselves. Who would ever have thought that we would use bombs here in our fighting.\n\nTuesday 27 July 1915\n\nVery hot again. A few shells over again. A big stock in today of bombs, detonators & fuses. We are using a tremendous lot of grenades lately. Went up to see Lt Col. Bennett. He used to be in the 4th Batt but since I last saw him he has moved to the 1st Batt. Had to go thro trenches galore to get to him. Saw a couple of the boys from the Coy & had a yarn with them. A lot of shooting last night both with shells & rifle fire. General Birdwood's ADC got killed last night by a shell (about 1 or 2 this morning). Bad luck. he was a fairly decent chap. More troops & guns landed last night. Our water supply (or rather new one) is rather a farce on the pipe line. They ran a pipe thro one of the boys dug outs & when they put the water thro' for a trail it flooded the dug out & they had to shift everything. We all got drinking & washing water out of it. Do us.\n\nWednesday 28 July 1915\n\nMore shells over this morning. Very close to our dug outs. Very hot still. Knocking about without singlet or anything in that line on. A lot of shells over all day & doing a considerable amount of damage. One shell tonight lobbed in HQ gully & richoled a couple of hundred yards to the beach. Waited a full half minute & then imploded. The Turks have a bog bomb now & they are doing considerable damage with. Plenty of firefee kicking about. The main ones we are attacking Sunday. Hope so.\n\nThursday 29 July 1915\n\nGot inoculated again this morning for cholera. Another big stock of bombs. Naval percussion & Malta filled with cordite. About 2200 altogether. Have a pretty big stock in now. Received a parcel from mother containing sox & a scarf from Granny. Had a bit of a sleep in the afternoon & just after tea went out visiting. Went to 3rd Coy, 12th Inf & 10th. Saw Perry & Jock Hamilton & all the","204":" T Coy heads. Kayeen has been away for over a fortnight. Stayed there till 10 & then went up to the Coy & had a yarn there with the boys. Stayed till 11 & then came home to bed. Arm isn't very sore. See some troops landing & saw 3-4.7 field guns well covered over. German aeroplanes went up while ours was up but ours was too far away to give chase. The german had some engine trouble & had to descend. Stopped a couple of bombs before he did that. Bombs fell very close to one while in the trenches.\n","205":"\n\nReal bosker morning. Fairly quiet all day but a Helles there was a heavy bombardment. A Taube went over in the afternoon about 6 o'clock. Dropped two bombs near the Engineers depot. Every body here fully expected to see the bombs come here over our position. Some Tommy Engineers. are taking over all beach duties so I expect will lose this job sooner or later.\n","206":"\n\nA Taube over early again this morning. Dropped 2 bombs but don't know where they went. Went up to the right flank & saw the whole line both old & new. Took a couple of photos of the old trench showing where we put up the wire entanglement early in the fight. My word must have lost a great deal of weight. Sweated a treat, The right are attacking tonight & going to take the trench in front. The Turks trenches look real beauties thro the periscope. Wire entanglements in front & all that class of goods. Hope they suceed. Had some cake from one of the boys & a piece of pudding from a cook across the road. 1350 bombs went out tonight.\n","207":" (9 After Trinity)","208":"\n\nThe 3rd Brigade attacked in the night & got the trenches they were after with a few casualties (75 to 80). During the night our posy here got shelled & we found pellets everywhere. No body was hurt tho. Still no church. Didn't write to day didn't know anything to write about. Back is getting quite brown now. Soon be an indian in skin color. A Taube flew over again tonight & went out of sight. One of our planes went out afterwards & the Taube came back & was high above ours. We thought we would see a good scrap but our boy manouvered & the Taube skidadaled.\n\nMonday (Bank Holiday)","209":"\n\nThe Turks haven't counterattacked yet. Suppose they are frightened of losing more men. Our boys didn't take any prisoners or wounded. All the Turks they saw were bayoneted & finished I believe. Expect a mail again anyday now. They are not irregular. Nothing much doing all day except to receive a big consignment of bombs & explosives. Got 18000 bombs in altogether & the stock finished is about 6000. Don't know where to stock the bombs.\n","210":"\n\nBombs again. Ha to make up a couple for Gen. Walker. Capt Parry Okeden came up & wants our stock for the 5th. Evidently this big attack will take place somewhere near that date. Cannot work in the night now because we cannot get any glimmers. Infantry carrying up the bombs until 10 o'clock. The beach was cleared then & they landed a few over 7000 men. The boats looked well coming in but could only make out the dark object on the water. The Turks were firing all night on the beach & even up our way. Some going very close. The shelling only got 2 men out of the whole landing as nearly everytime they fired the boys were either under cover or well away. Expect to land 33000 in 3 nights\n","211":"\n\nGetting a shade cooler now & the flies are not quite so bad. Capt. Waite is going off this job. Don't know who is getting his place. Got 30 men from the party that landed last night to help in the bomb factory as a lot are required for this big attack. Started them OK & early in the evening got the glad news of moving back to the Coy before the","212":" Therefore must be back for the attack. Was starting 2 shifts but couldn't get any candles so had to stop work about 9. Went down for a swim & got stopped coming back on account of the beach being cleared for the landing of troops.\n\nThursday 9 August 1915\n\nSuppose will have to hand over just about everything here to the Tommy RE's. Went for a stroll with the new officer in charge to pick out a position for a new store for storing the finished bombs. We are going to stay on for the simple reason that too many bombs are required to go out. Each Coy of the new battalion landing have to have 48 bombs. Plenty of troops still land during the night. The Turks starting shelling the beach again in the afternoon & killed the naval office in charge here. He was one of the officers who went up the Strait in a pinnace & blew up the sub. that ran aground. Issued 6840 last night. A pretty fair record.\n","213":"\n\nMore troops landed all night. Gurkha's finished landing about 7 this morning. They got shelled pretty badly. The Turks bombed our boys out of their new trench on the right but got driven out again by our bayonets. My stock of bombs has run out. Issued another 1000 this morning. A big shell has started coming over & just burst behind the factory. This attack of ours is going to be a big one & we are going to extend our line right thro to Maidos. Took a snap of the shell bursting. The attack or rather the preliminary started with the 1st Brigade attacking & keeping up Aus. good name. The guns put in some rapid shooting. The war boats came out & did some damage to Jacko. Shifts went right thro & stayed up till 1 am.\n\nStaurday","214":"\n\nGot awakened about 6. This is the main attack & will go down in history. We landed another 45000 down at Sulva's Point. Indian & Australians. War boats galore. destroyers, Hospital & transport boats all being in the boom. Plenty of go. Our boys are doing well. Captured plenty of Turks had 500 in by dinner time. Got a couple of mementos from some of the Turks. Took plenty of photos, about 8 or 9. A Turk aeroplane ran away from one of our planes. Beat ours easy in the race. Our left is advancing all the time. The only hitch is at Quinns Post. We can't drive them back from there yet. Soon will tho. Quinns Post is the only position where we cannot advance. The 1st Bdge are having the hardest time so far altho a lot of our boys are going away wounded. It was very quiet at 8 pm last night but later the war boats started firing again & made a great row. We were to attack on the right last night but haven't heard so far about it. A lot of guns have been silenced but Beachy Bill hasn't been silenced yet.\n\nSunday (11 After Trinity)","215":"\n\nMadge & Chris birthday. Plenty of gun fire this morning. Beachy Bill is doing some firing occasionally. The bombs are going out as fast as we make them. The new landing force & our force have joined up I believe. Very busy all day & didn't have time to write in this good old book. Old Beachy Bill hasn't been silenced & still sends in his shots when troops start landing. A lot of our boys have been cut up badly. The Corpl. in charge of my section in the Coy got hit in both legs & got knocked about generally. Must have had his luck had I been in charge Clogstoun got hit in the neck & there is a rumour that he has since died. The gun boats are still blazing away & our boys are using a tremendous number of bombs in the warfare now. Our output today was 2850.\n","216":"\n\nA good deal of rifle fire today & still a great no. of bombs going out! Already have issued 2300. Gen Carruthers came up & got some information on bombs etc. Seemed to get a shock when he found I had been here since its inception. Wants more men put on & the output increased. A mail in & got 3 letters so far 2 from Madge & one from Billy Reilly. Good oh The gun boats are going to rush the narrows tomorrow & hope they get thro OK. Quinns Post has fallen at last but we have lost a tremendous no. of men. A lot of our battalions are practically wiped out. The N.Z. retired 1500 yds but Tommies who made the fresh landing are still pushing forward so it seems as if it is going to be a trap for the \"sudden jinks\".\n","217":"\n\nThe 4-4 funnelers & the 3 monitors have left here & by all accounts yesterday. they are going to try and rush the narrows today. They all have blisters on so the Torpedoes won't affect them much. Two of our subs. have done some damage to the Turks again in the Sea of Marmara. Sunk a cruiser, a couple of gunboats & have bombarded the shore with their shrapnel guns on troops starting to reinforce this posy. It gets very quiet now. We cannot be pushing forward now. This scrap & the extra bit of graft doesn't stop my nightly swim. My word it is real bosker having the old dip before going to bed. The retreat the other day was made by Tommies who were getting the worst of the deal. They dropped their arms & scooted so the rumor goes. Seems hard to believe tho.\n","218":"\n\nHardly think there was a war on here today. Very quiet only an occasional shot going in & the artillery are very quiet. Got 4 more letters. 1 from home, Auntie Ett, Maggie & Mrs Winter. Still sending out plenty of bombs but I'm dammed if I know what to put in the answers to these letters. Have aching eyes nowadays. Suppose will soon get better. The news about the Tommies was quite correct. Worse luck shows that they hadn't been in the line long. They must have been real heroes running away like they did. With all our advance & shelling we haven't in the least silenced old Beachy Bill. He is still as cheeky as ever & fires at boats coming into the piers. A lot of No 2 Coy are missing. Boys from my new section too.\n","219":"\n\nDecent day today but still have eyes aching. Beach Bill fired about 20 shots at the Balloon this morning but didn't go anywhere near it. Lewis is ill with dysentery so have got the job back in the same old footing before he ever came on the scene. Am not feeling in the best of health at all now. Will evidently have a spell tomorrow. Wrote 4 or 5 letters & read one that Alex Howlett sent home to the papers. Went down for a dip & had the best of all. Started ducking one another & heaving a rag at each other. Just got out (after being in over ½ an hour) & Beachy Bill fired. Didn't get anyone tho. Got dressed & started along the beach for home when old Beachy fired again just 20 yds in the air from us. Bullets whistled damn close & the man with me thought he was hit. Had a look but it missed alright. He did have time to duck so we were exceedingly lucky. Went to the Hosp. for a couple of pills for my headache.\n","220":"\n\nMadge's Birthday. Feel much better today. Expecting all my parcels but no sign of them yet. Old Beachy Bill fired again this morning. Plenty of bombarding all night both here & at Helles. Things are fairly quiet all day but in the night there was plenty of rifle fire. Seemed as if the Turks were attacking. Five of our aeroplanes up at once. Not too bad. Wouldn't mind being home today. Would be bosker. Things are still on the same old monotous line again & unless we attack again the advance we made Friday week isn't so very much good to us because the Turks still stop us from going further. Every time we get on Hill 971 we get blown off again by the Turks artillery. We have lost a tremendous no of men since the attack first started (about 20000.)\n","221":"\n\nA bit warmer again today but it doesn't make any difference to the bomb stock. We always keep a fair supply but when we reach the 5000 limit we lose 3000 almost immediately. Tested a bomb early & went in for a preliminary dip. Went to the Coy. after tea & had a good old chat to some of the boys. Left there at 10 & then came home but didn't go to bed till 12. Plenty of firing from the gunboats up here at Sulva Point. Must have found a good target. Hope this scrap soon finishes now am getting tired of this place.\n\nSunday (11 After Trinity)","222":"\n\nOur 16 week. Wouldn't have believed it possible to stay so long without having a real big advance. Still one must learn. Hot again & the flies are very troublesome. Turks made 3 attacks on Lone Pine last night. Haven't exactly got the strength of things yet tho. Am going to the trenches this afternoon. 6 pm Went up to the trenches (The Lonesome Pine lot of trenches too) Saw plenty of Turks walking about. My word they are cheeky. Could see them easily because we had a long periscope but the man with the rifle couldn't reach them with his so that accounts for their cheekiness. Took a snap thro the periscope but don't know whether it will come out well. Only a sporting chance. Had a real bosker swim & some pills for my stomach.\n","223":"\n\nWarm again. This is funny weather. Hot one day & decent the next. Got a paper from home, a pr of sox & a paper from Alice G. also a letter from Else G. Nothing much doing all day e4xcept that one of the boys pinched a box of preserved fruits. Went real good. Do me. Would be much better with cream tho. Had a couple of decent swims. Feel like one continual swim when once I get in. Plenty of bombs in again.\n","224":"\n\nHot a gain & a few more bombs in. Parry OKeaen sent for me & had to stay with him for over 2 hours talking about bombs etc. He was drunk so had to humor him. He isn't a bad old stick. Am getting relieved tomorrow. Lewis walks into the bunk, woke me up & told me the news. It will do me as am getting sick of him. Ought to get on OK again in the Coy. Have packed my kit. Old Beachy has been firing nearly all the afternoon & did some damage. Its about time he was caught. Got one or two things ready for moving & went down for a dip. Got some figs coming back & when I got home sent some of the boys down & they got 2 cases (A good haul). A Turk plane (Taube) flew over in the evening & dropped 6 bombs on Salva Point. The warships fired but missed her badly.\n","225":"\n\nPacked up & got Bert Shipp down to give me a hand to move things up to the Coy. Moved up & did some sweating getting up there too. Very hot today. Got a Got some writing paper too. Also received 2 pr sox from home. Good oh. News here that the Russians are walloping the Germans at Warsaw. Hope they do. A man was carrying bombs to the trenches in a sand bag yesterday & dropped them on the ground for a spell. One went off. Killed 2 men & wounded 3. Rotten luck. A Turk sub sunk a sweeper with 5.5\" amm. on. One of our subs in Sea of Marmara got a 8000 tons transport. So that evens things. Reported to Martyn. He said wasn't much good to the Coy as might be a Bomb Expert but wasn't a field one. So will have to learn. Read all the afternoon. Am starting work tomorrow. Am still able to have my nightly swim.\n","226":"\n\nUp early & went right through the trenches finding out where my section works. Got on OK. Bukll Williams goes to No 3 Coy as Major. Don't know how he will get on. Had a read after dinner & then went to the trenches again. Had tea & after a spell went to the Bomb Factory to see what I could pinch. Things are in a bit of a mess there at present. Bought up the bed & some books so didn't do too bad. Had a feast when we got back & then to bed. Nothing unusual for a days work. When in the trenches the 75 gun of the Turks started throwing over some shells.\n","227":"\n\nWe should start our holiday today but have to do fatigue all the morning so will start our spell as soon as we finish. Our 48 hrs holiday started after dinner. Improved my dug out all the afternoon & drew the fire of Beachy Bill. Must have thought it was a gun pet. Hope he soon finds out his mistake. He kept putting them in nearly all the afternoon so of course me job was a long one. Half of the 5th Bdg landed last night & went out to the left. The other half land tonight. Hope we soon get relieved. Am not feeling too good. Head ache etc (from working in the sun without a hat).\n","228":"\n\nStill on our spell. Read all day but felt ill all the afternoon. Bad stomach & head. Had a rotten night. Woke up dozens of times & always took a long time to go to sleep afterwards. Had rheumatics all night in my left arm. Was really murderous. An attack by us on the left all day. No news about it yet tho War boats & our guns all a tremendous amount of shooting. We got 4 lines of trenches & the Turks man well. Three cases of bombs exploded about 9 pm. Killed 4 wounded 15 & killed 7 mules. Did plenty of damage. Went to bed at 6 so didn't hear the explosion.\n\nSunday (12 After Trinity) August 22 1915\n\nMakes our 17th Week. Am very sore to day. Wouldn't mind a holiday from here. Our spell finished at 12 o'clock today. There isn't too much work to do now. Hope they can't find us a job. Must write some letters some time today. Got 2 jobs, a tunnel & job for Div Egrs. Went up to the trenches & showed the boys where to start but felt rotten all the way. Asked our AMC boy to put the thermometer in my mouth & it went to 104.5. No wonder I felt rotten. Went to the","229":" Field Amb & had to wait there till 10 & then went to the Clearing station Missed the last boat by 5 minutes & had to sleep on the ground & got umpty lice on me for the trouble\n","230":"\n\nA rotten day. Didn't get to the Hospital Ship (No 16 Devanna) till about 1.30. Was real murderous waiting about for the launch to take us. Left the Devanna just after dinner & went on board a trawler & came down to Sulva's Point & went on another Hosp Ship the \nDevanna\n Essaye. She is a real bosker big boat. Sleeping on the main deck tonight. Doctor came & took my pulse & told me I had fever. Am sweating down so will soon be able to go in the racing line.\n","231":"\n\nDidn't feel too bas. Didn't have a good night tho. Back very sore, Dreamt I was moving big timber so that might account for it. This point here is very stony & dry. Nothing like our end. I see a windmill 3 more planes of a network of timber a cover for another balloon & aeroplanes. Doctor sent me down below to D ward.\n","232":"\n\nFainted last night. 1st time in my life. Got out of bed to go to the latrine & I couldn't get back. Asked the sister & the doctor (they were dressing a wounded man by) to throw me into the bed. It was a top one. Instead they put me on a bottom bed & gave me a glass of brandy to swallow. Soon woke me up.\n","233":"\n\nEnteric still. No better. Left Imbros at daybreak & made for Lemnos & reached it just before dinner time.\n","234":"\n\nNo better. Don't know the day – we reach Lemnos but we stayed there one & a half days & a lot of dysentry cases got off there & a lot of wounded transhipped & went home to England. \n","235":"\n\nNo better\n\nSunday (13 After Trinity)","236":" \n\nExpect to reach Alex tomorrow Might get a decent sleep once I get on land.\n","237":"\n\nLeft the Hosp. Ship & came per motor to Victoria Hospital 9 miles from Alexandria. A cold drive & plenty of jolts. Forgot all about them when I got into bed tho. Doctor came & sounded me. Must still have the symptoms of enteric. Had a wash. All English sisters & doctors. Had to wait about a great deal on the boat before getting moved away.\n","238":"\n\nMoved from bottom ward upstairs. Am getting a ragtime writer. Still on milk diet, Aus. Sister in this ward & she came from Adelaide Hosp. Plenty of enteric patients here. One poor chap only bone. He is terrible.\n","239":"\n\nGot awakened about 4.30 for cocoa & then a wash & temperature. Am going to have a shave tomorrow. Not before I need it either. This lad in the opposite bed to me sings out all day & night. Doctor took some of my blood & put in a test tube. See how many germs I've caught.\n","240":"\n\nSleep fairly well here & don't seem to like the idea of waking up so early. Must write home today. My bombs gave them a scare here at first. Everybody thought they were loaded. Wrote home alright but in a terrrible scramble. \nA lad\n","241":"\n\nStill on milk diet. Won't be in the least bit sorry when there is something heavier to eat. Doctor says am doing OK. but my temp won't stay down so must still stay on milk. Will soon be getting thin Legs show it now. Lad from another ward died in the afternoon.\n","242":"\n\nThis lad opposite me died early this morning. My word the poor kid was terribly thin. Bone almost poking through the skin. Nothing much to write in this now Im here. A concert down below. All we could hear was the cheering & clapping.\n\nSunday (14 After Trinity)","243":"\n\nStill on milk diet. there was a concert down below tonight. Singing sacred songs. Always finish up with God Save the King. Nothing much doing still. Temperature keeps a bit steadier. The sooner it gets even the sooner Ill go on hard food.\n","244":"\n\nPlenty of french trumpets blowing at the back of us. They have a big horse camp there. Nothing much doing all day. Had a pretty good sweat. Flies are very troublesome.\n","245":"\n\nShaved myself this morning fairly clean too Some of the lads (the convalescent) got to Port Said today. See in todays paper that poor old Wally Leckie got killed in France (rather he died of wounds) No band tonight Missed it a bit Ought to soon be on solid food now\n","246":"\n\nVery sleepy today.

Plenty of reading\n","248":"\n\nHave done a fair amount of reading since being in here, but often get tired of it. Am at present reading David Grieve (cannot find the Authors monogram). Wrote to the Bank today asking them a few questions. Get an answer in about 3 weeks time I suppose The man next to me is getting lower every day but still seems to hang on\n","249":"\n\nA lovely morning. Read nearly all the morning. Had bread & milk in the morning & bread and butter in the afternoon. Getting on to something decent now. Feel OK. The lad on my left died at 12.15 pm. I had only just gone to sleep so didn't know for an hour afterwards.\n\nSunday (15 After Trinity)","250":"\n\nFeel as fit as a fiddle & am only waiting to get up now. Could hear some bands in the distance. Nothing unusual happened all day except a visit from some General & all his staff. Had plenty with him too They'd do much better at the front I think.\n","251":"\n\nHad porridge for brekker. Something unusual. Am anxiously waiting for my mail to come along. Wrote home to Aunt Maggie & read all day. Had a bit of a snooze but it spoils my nights sleep then. Still ask to get up & will be able in a couple of days time.\n","252":"\n\nVery bad stomach today.

Plenty of papers to read today. So did well Wrote to Lt Col. Bennett.\n","253":"\n\nTemperature is going down gradually. At 6 am it was 100.4. So it might get right down again. Hope it does.

A bit of a clearing out. Some more sent to Port Said & 8 sent out from the convalescent ward down below to take their place. Am going to be moving to the Con Ward\n\nSunday (16 After Trinity)","257":"\n\nNearly at the end of this book now. Real bosker weather since I've been here. Same old quiet Sunday but not too quiet at the Peninsula I suppose. Read all day from 6 am till 6.30 pm. Light too bad then so couldn’t do any more.\n","258":"\n\nAm doing OK. Must ask today to get out o f bed. Hear that Hamilton has been recalled & Smith Dorrien taken his place, About time a change was made. We might win now. Nothing doing all day.\n","259":"\n\nAm anxiously waiting to get out of bed now. Doctor came round & won’t be able to get up for another 4 days yet. Am as well now as ever I will be here Still it won't make much diff I suppose\n","260":"\n\nThink I will sleep today instead of reading. Will be hurting my eyes if I don't. Didn't do anything in the sleeping time but read all day again. Am feeling just it but cannot get up because my temp. won't remain steady.\n","261":"\n\nBit warmer today. Wrote to Ellise. Very funny act at dinner time. In the morning when one of the sisters was handing out the chocolate I didn't get any because she said I was on chicken for dinner. When the orderly came at dinner time he asked me if I was on chicken so I said yes & got it. I asked him if two others were on & he said \"if you want it take it\" so of course I grasped immediately. Had peeled two potatoes when the calamity fell. Was not on & they were one short so lost it. Got moved from one end of the ward to the other about 7 pm so that some of the lads wouldn't be sick when one of the men was. The man won't eat & swears at the sisters.\n","262":"\n\nNew scenery this morning but don't like this new posy as well as the old one. Waited till 5 pm for a book & then got a mad thing. Am getting up tomorrow & going on chicken. Be much better than fish. Tried again to get 10\/- out of my purse for the photos but failed again. Hope I get them tomorrow. They have been in the shop 15 days.\n","263":"\n\nHad a better sleep last night & didn't get awakened at all during the night by the man I changed places with. Got it 4 more patients in today. A big convoy came in bringing mostly dysentery cases. Got up out of bed & couldn't stand up. the new man was put in the convalescent ward & as I got carried in he took my place. Real bosker in here.\n\nSunday (17 After Trinity)","264":"\n\nBetter in here than in the bog ward. Am able to walk about a little but mustn't do too much yet or else will find myself back in bed. Had chicken potatoes & vegetable for dinner & it went OK. Doctor said that I was stronger than the usual run but had never been very ill.\n","265":"\n\nCan walk about easily today. Stomach giving a bit of trouble today. Sister told me my will accounted for me being out of bed so quickly. Reading Australian papers today.\n","266":"\n\nAm doing real well now. Better than I expected, The Russians are doing well now & at the Western frontier they were doing even better. Think it will soon finish now. Expect to be sent home to Australia after going to Port Said. Will be going there soon I hope. Got 6 letters but none from home.\n","267":"\n\nHaven't been outside yet but will go out today. Am starting to answer the letters. Don't know how long it will take though. Went out for a stroll & got on real bosker better than I expected. They are all surprised at my strength, even the doctor.\n","268":"\n\nWent all round the grounds for a walk. Wasted half the morning waiting for my money but got it in the afternoon. 2 Bands played in the afternoon, scotch & brass. Met 2 boys from the bomb factory & got some news of the peninsula.\n","269":"\n\nStill wander about & play cards. Doctor came in in the morning & took 7 of our names & told would leave for England on Sunday. Wrote to Elsie Grat. Should have done it ages ago but didn't. Sent watch to get mended\n","270":"\n\nGot watch back but didn't get the photos because the sister didn't have the ticket. Got the word that we cannot leave for a while yet. Doctor came early & told me that he would be very surprised if we were here by Wednesday. Played cards & we all created a disturbance before going to bed.\n\nSunday (18 After Trinity)","271":"\n\nStrolled about in the morning. Played cards all the afternoon & then went to church. Came back again & played cards as soon as I got in. Made a terrible row last night & we all expect to get moved to the tents.\n","272":"\n\nAm tired of being here now & won’t be sorry when I move away. A band played in the afternoon & met McNicol again. He hadn't any luck in getting away to Cairo.\n","273":"\n\nHad a good talk with one of our artillery boys. Collected some spare papers at the P.O. & had a good old read. More word about going away tomorrow morning at 9.30. Went over for kits & couldn't get them till the morning Much speculation as to whether we were actually going.\n","274":"\n\nCollected our kits, but they were creased a treat. Nearly missed breakfast. We are going to Port Said. Have just answered the roll call. Left the Hospital & arrived at the station at 11. Left for Pt. Said at 11.30 & arrived there at 5.30. Passed some big camps also Ismalia & Kantara where the Turks tried to get through. Went on to a barge & we got taken by a tug to our new destination. Had dinner & tea on the train & supper at the new place. We are camped in a big hall in an engineering depot but by appearances has never been used.\n","275":"\n\nUp at 6 & had a wash & look about. A boat leave for Australia today week so might go home then. Met Lucas. He used to be in No 2 Coy but was transferred to the new Corp in the 2nd Div. Walked about all day. Went in for a dip & in the evening went to the Red Cross & had a couple of games. Went to bed at 6.30. Something unusual\n","276":"\n\nWent to the doctor to get permission to go to Port Said to get my tooth fixed up. Got it & left at 2 with the party & got back at 5. Didn't have a look at it as there were too many others so have to go tomorrow. Bought some spools & did a bit of shopping for the boys. Went down & got boarded in the evening we must be leaving very soon.\n","277":"\n\nWent into the dentist & got tooth fixed. Washed my tunic & pyjamas this morning & went for a long walk & felt the effects of it. The Suez Canal Coy has some magnificent buildings on this island home of ours. Went for a drive and nearly missed the dentist. Went in again after tea (without leave) Don't like the look of the place in the night. There isnt anything to see,\n\nSunday (10 After Trinity)","278":"\n\nWent walking all day. Took a couple of photos. Went into a bit of a fitting shop & did about 5 minutes striking for a blacksmith. It was a mixed nationality in the shop. Greeks niggers etc. Went for a swim & had a long stroll out to sea on a breakwater made by the Canal Coy. Took us an hour & half to do it & come back. Went chasing land crabs just before dark & wounded a few by kicking them to pieces. Couldn't go to sleep for a long time on account of the row on here.\n","279":"\n\nHaven't much to put in today. Went walking all the morning & read in the afternoon. Could have collected pay. It was only 10\/- worth of tickets for Red Cross so they were not worth taking as one can only use them in the Red Cross. Tooth I had stopped has been aching all day\n","280":"\n\nGot my photos from Alexandria today Went to Pt. Said to see the dentist but as he hadn't killed the nerve properly made him put some more stuff in to kill it. \n\nSpent all the money I had except 1\/- suppose that will go tomorrow.\n","281":"\n\nHave moved camp as have awakened every morning with a cold in the head. Moved to the corner of the room. Two teeth giving one fits all day. Went to the dentist & he bored the wisdom down deeper. Tested it to see if the shell would hold. Told me the nerve was killed but put some more stuff in to kill it. Have to go again Friday. Didn't spend a \/- so made up for yesterday.\n","282":"\n\nWent for a walk in the morning but didn't have anything to do in the afternoon. Wrote 3 letters 2 to the boys & one to Aunt Maggie. A P&O Mail line came in & snapped her as she was nearing De Lessops Statue.\n","283":"\n\nThe Tommies got orders last night for a parade in uniform for today & again later on in the day. A few Australians tried to get home to England but were not allowed. Two big mails came in but nothing for me. The Tommies got their labels at 7.30 pm & leave tomorrow at 6 am. Played cards till the mail came & then went to bed. Dentist says another 3 days before my tooth finished.\n","284":"\n\nTommies left this morning. Took a snap of them. All Australians had a parade at 2 pm yesterday & more leave here within 48 hours. Doesn't look as if |I can get my tooth finished here. Orders came that only 101 Australians were to go so didn't expect to go & wasn't at all disappointed when I found my name wasn't amongst the list. Went over to the dentists & got it fixed again but have to go again Tuesday. Another boat is expected in 4 or 5 days & she will take the remainder from here. The Kanowna Took the 101 & the Karoola is expected.\n\nSunday (20 After Trinity)","285":"\n\nWent to the Armenian Refugees Camp in the morning & again in the afternoon. In the morning went round the camp. Some good looking boys & girls there but the majority are not much. None can speak english so of course didn't speak to any of them. The red cross people from Port Said were issuing books to them. Spoke to some of them. Took a lot of photos there. In the afternoon got the whole male population out by throwing a tennis ball \"a la Fijian\". Got the men trying to throw the ball past me but my own height when threw they used to grind their teeth & I fully enjoyed myself there. The camp is 4500 strong & each family lives in a bell tent. Every family there has plenty of children\n","286":"\n\nFeel just a trifle stiff in the arms. Hope our boat comes today. There is a tremendous amount of children at the Armenian Camp. Even a lot in arms evidently born in the camp. They seem very clean people, much cleaner than the natives here. Finished off some photos in the morning & in the afternoon went to the Salt Works. The salt water us run into pans & allowed to evaporate leaving the salt behind. This is then made into large heaps (pyramid style) & after being in the sun for a long time it dries. Then it is carried over to the crushing plant & crushed. Took some photos there & then went over to the Armenian Camp again & came back past the Vacuum Oil Coy\\ big benzine tanks. A big oil boat was just coming in too for benzine. Went in for a dip & got a big appetite for tea.\n","287":"\n\nDid some printing in the morning & went over to the A.S.C. Had some time to spare so went on board A16 Star of Victoria. She landed troops at Suez & is now going to Genoa. What she is going for no body seems to know. We missed the paddle boat so had to row back. Took a hand in it too. Went over to the dentist & got my tooth finished. Have a pretty large piece of amalgum there. Went to the station & came back with the new boys (100 of them altogether) & missed my tea over it too, so had some out of the new boys lot. Very funny here about 11 pm. A drunk started to walk all round the room. Everybody thought he was asleep & there was whistling & all sorts of row started. Capt Patterson was sent for & he stopped all the row. It was very funny tho while it lasted & I enjoyed it as much as anybody.\n","288":"\n\nWent ashore in the morning & bought over 5 kit bags but mine wasn't amongst them. About 70 more Australians came in last night. Hope we soon get out of this. Printed some more photos in the \nmorning\n afternoon. Went strolling in the evening. Chased crab & did some mending. Got 10 letters but still none from home. Wonder where they are.\n","289":"\n\nWrote answers to the majority of letters. Went ashore both morning & afternoon. It is the Egyptians Christmas Day today. Went right along the tram track & came across the recreation ground. Whirligigs pushed by men, swing boats & smaller side shows such as conjurors, bands etc. A colonel was here today to see into complaints by the men. Again ordered my kit bag also a jacket & breeches. Still a little hot here but the nights are cool. Just the same as Mena\n","290":"\n\nMore city but am absolutely sick of the place. The only reason I go in now is for the simple reason of putting in the day. Received a parcel from home 2 prs sox & boracic acid. Haven't received any letters from home since leaving the peninsula. Sole 20 photos for 3\/-. Should have charged more but printed them myself & it is nearly all clear profit.\n\nAm orderly sergeant tomorrow.\n","291":"\n\nOver again, but nothing doing over in the city. Went for a good stroll in the evening & did a few more crabs in. the hospital ship went out & is going to Southampton. Hope our boat comes in\n\nSunday (21 After Trinity 1915)","292":"\n\nWent & got a new shirt this morning instead of going to the city. Went in with the dentist party, but he wasn't open so went all round the tow in a garry. Got a bosker surprise when coming back too. Found 12 letters waiting for me. Went to church as a very good means of putting in the evening.\n","293":"\n\nWent to the ASC for the kit bags. Got mine & hardly had anything taken from it. Went on boat the \"City of Paris\" & had a walk around. Went over to the city with the party to the dentist & nearly missed my tea on account of being late. Got 2 letters, 1 from Elsie G & the other from W Reilly.\n","294":"\n\nMother's birthday\n\nSome old humdrum life. Twice to the city. Ducked one of the boys from the boat. They didn't want to take us on the Osterley & pulled the rudder out. Gave him two or three chances to put it in but he wouldn't. First he got his head ducked & when he still wouldn't put the rudder in he went right in himself. He could swim well too. Best afternoons sport I've put in here.\n","295":"\n\nBit rough on the water today. Must be very rough outside, bet out little rowing smack would bounce about. Nothing doing all day except the same old routine. It is really monotous now\n","296":"\n\nAm getting tired of writing the same things in day after day. Always plenty of rumors here, about the different lots going away but they all fizzle out. Big P & O boat in yesterday & everybody coming ashore had to show their passport. Looked funny seeing the people get hauled up by the Customs people & looked at the photo & then at the person\n","297":"\n\nA hospital ship came in at 4 & she was an Australian. Of course excitement ran high. At 10 oclock (pm) Capt Redpath came round & read out 70 odd names for the trip home. Well all the names read out were the last lot to come in & those who had been here 3 weeks were left. Our papers are supposed to be \nleft\n lost at the base. If so Col. McKenzie should be should while standing on his head. Capt. Redpath rang up & had a great argument with him but it was of no use & we have to remain.\n","298":"\n\nHad a talk with Redpath about the boat & he explained things much better. The N.Z. here collected £ ; 1 each & the majority of them went ashore & got drunk. Very funny they were too. Got my negatives developed & and going to print tomorrow. The Afric is in from Salonika. One of the crew told me about the Marquette being torpedoed there. Lost 120 men including 7 N Z sisters,\n\nSent a letter home by the Afric & hope it to reach home safely.\n\nSunday (22 After Trinity)","299":"\n\nDid printing all the morning. \n\nStill a chance of us going home on the Karoola. A new roll has been made out & we may leave tonight for Suez. No luck stiff as ever. Another mixed batch came in 106 altogether. Did all the filing in the afternoon & wrote 2 letters.\n","300":"\n\nWent ashore to the ASC & saw a couple of decent boats. The Cornwall came in early in the morning. she was at the peninsula doing a bit of damage to Jacko.\n\nWhen the mail was being given our we got the good news of going on Wednesday & by the old Karoola. Go by train from here to Suez so we will have the advantage in every way. The 2 letters I wrote will not be wanted now as I will be home as soon as them.\n","301":"\n\nNothing unusual happened today except a court martial for one of the men. He went in to the dentist with me on Sat or Friday & I gave him permission to stay in the city for an hour or two but he got drunk & made a nuisance of himself & naturally not arrested. I had to give evidence & after it was over got told off for letting him go. I deserved it too. The man got 7 days. Collected 10\/- afterwards as pay. Too much to spend.\n","302":"\n\nHad to parade at 9.30 & the \ntrain\n didn't call for us for over an hour. Left Port Said at 12 so arrived at Port Suez 6 pm. Had bully beef, bread & jam for dinner. Took some photos & they should be O.K. Had to wait for ages at the Port before we were taken to the wharf to the boat. \n","303":"\n\nLeft Suez for home at 10.45 am. We had to stop to put the guard off, but that was all. She is a decent little boat & they expect to average 13 knots right thro. Had a sleep in the morning. Happened to get mess orderly on account of sitting at the end of the table. Very hot work but it isn't too bad.\n","304":"\n\nRolling this morning.\n\nPassed a couple of boats. Real hot below on our mess deck. Real hell there but the food is real bosker.\n","305":"\n\nReading all day.\n\nStill very hot.\n\nSunday (23 After Trinity)","306":"\n\nReal all the morning & didn't go to church. \n\nTook 4 of the lads photo. Still hot. Suppose it will be the same till after leaving Columbo.\n","307":"\n\nBreeze came up during the night & made the whole day cooler. Passed Aden. Also passed a lot of boats including the Kyarra which left a day or so before us. Played cards all the morning\n","308":"\n\nMess orderly today for two meals & will be for one tomorrow\n\nCool all day.\n","309":"\n\nPitching today & consequently woke up with a headache.\n\nPitched all day. Was mess orderly for brekker.\n","310":"\n\nStorm brewing up. Got plenty of rain during the night & the majority of deck sleepers had to do a bunk.\n","311":"\n\nCooler all day but still stormified. Got a little rain before going to bed. \n\nOne NCO & 15 men making a party are to be allowed to go ashore at Colombo so everybody is busy getting up a list.\n","312":"\n\nStill cool but very close down below. \n\nRained again.\n\nWe seem to be in the right spot for the rain this time.\n\nSunday (24 After Trinity)","313":"\n\nVery heavy rain this afternoon. Lasted for a couple of hours.\n","314":"\n\nReached Colombo at 7 am. Saw the Seangbee in the bay with troops on. Poor Beasts. The parties were put into morning & afternoon trips. Mine was in the afternoon & thoroughly enjoyed myself. Went round a lot of shops & did some good money in. There were motor cars waiting to take us for afternoon tea but a lot of us didn't go, preferring to stay in the city. It looks a very decent show too.\n","315":"\n\nThe Cornwall left this morning & we leave after dinner. A lot of the men came back dead drunk & are still there now. We ought to go & leave them here. Had a big parade at our beds to find out exactly who is here. We left at ¼ to 1 & it rained from noon until early the next morning.\n","316":"\n\nVery rough yesterday & today making a lot miss a couple of meals. Getting fruit for dinner now.\n","317":"\n\nNot too bad today. More fruit a dinner time. Sewed colors on my new coat. Very hot down here.\n","318":"\n\nBig sea started & kept up all day. Played cards & read all day. Rained again.\n","319":"\n\nStill a big sea. Seems to be getting worse. Someone pinched a library book of mine but got another by the same author. Rained again during the night.\n\nSunday (25 After Trinity)","320":"\n\nPassed Cocos Islands this afternoon. Have started to repaint the ship. \n\nA little rough today.\n","321":"\n\nStill a little rough. A breeze is blowing well & it will make the sea bigger.\n","322":"\n\nBig sea running making the boat pitch & roll. Makes a lot of the boys miss their meals.\n","323":"\n\nA little bit worse than yesterday. She takes a tremendous dip on the starboard side.\n","324":"\n\nBit calmer today & it is about time too. We’ve had plenty of rough weather.\n","325":"\n\nArrived at Freemantle at 6.45 pm. All the boats in cheered us & all the syrens blew off. Bit of a rejoicing. About 5 pm a picant boat came alongside filled with people from Perth. Gave us a few selections by the band & was much appreciated. Not much of a place to see tho. Would like to go ashore & see it better. Real bosker weather now.\n\nThe Katoomba is in here. Did a little bit of signalling to somebody on shore.\n","326":"\n\nVery cold last night. A blanket wasn't enough. the Katoomba left about 12. We left about 3.30 pm & at the heads was the Omrah. Had plenty of fruit & fresh meat brought on board. Also good coal. We ought to be able to go some good mileage now. Hope to be in Adelaide on Wednesday. Got a letter from Mother & wired her an answer.\n\nSunday (1 in Advent)","327":"\n\nVery cold all day especially last night. Struck some heavy weather so I expect we will get it heavier still.\n","328":"\n\nDid a bit of printing. Passed a passenger boat. Couldn't make her name out. Packed part of my kit. Lent my negatives some time ago & have lost one or two on account of it. Very cold all day. Very little sun all day.\n","329":"\n\nVery cold again today. Had an inspection of everybody on the boat for stolen property. Didn't find much tho. Rained while on parade & made it very cold.\n","330":"\n\nVery cold, windy & very rough. It was very windy all night. The wind howled thro the masts & rigging. See land nearly all day. Neptune Is. & Kangaroo Island. Reached Outer Harbour about 7.15 pm but stayed out in the bay & not going alongside.\n","331":"\n\nNot too cold last night. Kits had to be stacked at 6.30 am & we are to disembark at 7.30. Got to the wharf at 9 am being taken over by a launch. Had to wait a good ¼ hour on the boat for the train to arrive.\n\nVery poor reception. Not half as good as Freemantle & that was poor. The Karoola left as soon as we got off.\n\n"}}
