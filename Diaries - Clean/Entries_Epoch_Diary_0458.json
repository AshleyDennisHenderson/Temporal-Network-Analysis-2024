was at 2 a.m. at the Show Ground Sydney. All my reinforcement, with one exception, was present. Marched in the darkness to Dawes Point Wharf. It could hardly be called a march for we were all accompanied by our relations and friends – on our arms, carrying our packs, or doing everything imaginable for us.\n\nEmbarked between 5 and 6 am on this magnificent transport A40 or \"Ceramic\". There are 2700 reinforcements on board. I had to drop a man out at the last moment on the wharf for a shanghaied man who had been taken aboard from Darlinghurst. I chose a married man who had previously applied to be transferred\n\n \n\nto a later reinforcement.\n\nThe men were paid 6 days’ pay. We pulled out near to the Heads\nand left\n for the day and finally left the harbour about 4.30 pm. Everyone is thoroughly weary after two nights with practically no sleep. We all feel very sad. Myself, I try to imagine how sad my wife, with our three children, will be. I am very proud to be O\/C as 2nd Lieut of such a fine reinforcement. Met Griffiths – an old chum from the Training College and University – on board going home as a Munition Chemist.\n","2":"\n\nBeautiful day – very little sea-sickness on board. Men are settled down. Church Services were held at 10.15. The Padres are Rettie (C. of E.)., O’Regan (R.C.) and \n\nBruce (Pres).\nPadre\n Serg Burns is very good as Troop-deck sergeant. I have promised to try and get him permanent stripes when we reach England. Porpoises have been plentiful all day and are very interesting. Storm coming up from West. 2nd Lieut George Bentley,\nis\n second-in-command of my reinforcement, shares my cabin with me. He\nis\n also is married & has a daughter. Wrote J. (my wife); and Lt Pike of Kiama Camp, re sandshoes for the men having disappeared. Storm came up from West towards evening.\n","3":"\n\nVictoria in sight. Passed Wilson’s Promontory last night at 10. Seasick this evening but it is not very troublesome. Took a long run on\nUpper\n upper deck. No room on boat for drills for men but we manage to have a small space for Physical Drill making arrangements re time with other Bns. The","4":" Bn has to find 12 Ship Police and 26 for Boat Guard. I am O\/C Boat Guard and have also 26 of 3rd Bn with me on the job.\n\n \n\nOur duties are to prevent the boats being rushed in case of accident, so on any alarm we have to be first there.

Hilly country in night with many villages and apparently fine scenery. We all have pleasant – very – recollections of the Kindness of Durbanites.\n\nDurban a very fine and pleasant city – rather warmer and moister than Sydney. Greenery everywhere. Roads very fine and well kept, some blocked, most asphalted, all beautifully smooth.\n\nSpent 2½ days at Durban, the first day unfortunately as Ship’s Orderly Officer having to stay on board.\n\nPractically everything is done here by Kaffirs and coolies. The Rickshaw men and their light rickshaws take the place of our horses and cabs. The Zulus are the rickshaw men and are very powerful and well built.\n\nThe native police are very big, and have a high opinion of themselves. They seem very effective, the Zulus and other natives being apparently very afraid of them.\n\nThe Zulu rick-men got a great harvest from the Australians who seemed to scorn giving the usual 3d for a mile run, tossing them shillings and florins instead. The Durbanites grumble at this as they say we are spoiling the natives who are a great problem with them. They themselves cannot get a rickshaw while the Australians are in port because the Zulus pretend not to see them, waiting for an Australian instead.\n\nOne Australian was attracted by some black women down to the native quarter. Here he was mobbed, and chased by an angry black crowd. He would have received a very\n\nrough handling had he not been seen by other Australians. I don’t think he will ever go near a Hindoo or native quarter again.\n\nFrom the ship our men scattered considerable sums of money among the Kaffir sea-side workers. Great amusement was caused by throwing water upon them while they were in a seething bunch on the wharf looking for a threepence.\n\nThe Durban Tramcars are electric, and municipally-owned. They run all single cars and double deckers. All soldiers travelled free upon the invitation of the Municipal Council, which also provided free admission to Zoo, Baths and Botanic Gardens.\n\nDurban Beach Parade is beautiful.

Enthusiastically welcomed on these marches.\n\n \n\nSome ladies distributed hundreds of oranges and \"nachis\" (mandarines) to the troops.

We were made very welcome.

The latter flare up in anger for the moment but are soon cheerfully\n\nat work again. They work with a sing-song and appear at work as happy as school children at play.\n\nThe natives are in every trade except plastering which Australian workmen run and will not instruct natives in.\n\nDurban has a Tram\ndelivery\n Parcel-delivery System. Buy a penny ticket and place it on the parcel, and pay another penny on delivery of parcel at the second parcel depôt. These depots are shops near certain tramstops where arrangements have been made by the Council for the shop keeper to take in or deliver these parcels. It should be a good system to have in Sydney and Melbourne, also fruit delivery from markets by early morning empty trams going to suburbs. \n\nLieut Bentley’s sister at Durban gave him a large iced cake which he is going to cut\n\nfor my birthday on","21":" – I was struck with the children’s paddling basins and open surfing \"enclosure\" safe from sharks.\n\nEntry","22":"\n\nAfter a very calm & pleasant voyage arrived at Capetown at 9 pm on","23":" Searchlights were busy and we had to follow a special route into the bay on account of mines.\n\nDrew into wharf next morning. No welcome at all from the townspeople, except by a few privately. The town, bay and Table Mtn were very interesting, but on account of familiarity with the place through pictures and reading there was little novelty.\n\nVisited with Lt. Read the Gardens, Museum, Art Gallery, Provincial Parliament Houses, and Education Department and lunched at the City Club. Australian Officers are honorary officers of the Capetown Clubs. After lunch we casually met Mr Adrian Van der Byl, who\n\ninvited us to tea at his place at Kenilworth. Lt. Bentley (13th) and myself went as Lt. Read was on Guard Duty. The Van der Byls are a fine little family of five. The eldest girl is at College in Johannesburg. They are one of the oldest Dutch families in S.

We were not allowed to march along the main road on account of heavy military traffic there \nto\nand so had to take sloppy\ntrack\n and boggy tracks\nas far\n almost as far as Pont Noyelles.

Weather warm for here at this time of the year. I am in charge of No 8 Platoon.\n\nWe arranged a splendid Xmas Dinner for our men – Lt Stones in charge with myself assisting. All Companies did wonderfully considering the shortage and price of everything eatable. Each man put in 3 francs, and officers and Battalion Funds also contributed. \"B\" Coy had hot dinner – stuffed mutton, ham, and roast beef; with plenty of potatoes, cabbage & onions; plum pudding from Australian Comforts; nuts, raisins, ginger,sweets from Xmas parcels, cakes, wine, beer, cigars & cigarettes, and plenty of everything. We borrowed the local schoolroom and managed to squeeze in. We also bought 300 paper plates & hired 120 glasses. The officers acted as waiters.\n\nOur own officers’ dinner followed at 6.30. The Company dinner lasted about 3 hours\n\nand our own about 4. I was secretary for our dinner, but I left everything to Madame Sauvé & her sister, asking them to give us the best French dinner they could, and not to mind the price. In addition to her menu we had Australian plum pudding. She charged 210 francs for the dinner. 13 officers sat down & we had 13 toasts.

But she’s only four. In this area there are no demoiselles at all – only old people and little children. Nearly all the young women have left the district for the more settled parts of France until après la guerre. Many of them are away in munition factories. \n\nI have visited many French villages lately. The country itself is beautiful but the villages !!! are over the fence. The old village pumps are still the only water supply even in the greater part of cities like Boulogne or Abbeville. Each evening – where they have these pumps – women carry their pails to the street pump for the next day’s water. Many villages haven’t even a pump. There are dirty stagnant pools nearly everywhere where the village ducks swim. No wonder the French don’t drink water. Wine and cider are certainly preferable to their water supply.\n\n(B)\n\nI have been to scores of houses \nthat\nin various villages and have only seen one with a W.C. There is no sanitary system at all; the garden or manure heap doing. There are no latrines in the streets, so the open footpath does even before a crowd passing by. One becomes used to anything. Manure seems the most important thing everywhere as the fields have been worked intensely for so many centuries that manure is quite necessary for cultivation.\n\nAny\nMany of these villages, if in Australia would be pulled down by the Authorities. The people are contented for they have always lived this life and never desire anything else. Even if they did desire a change they are generally too poor to make improvements. They won’t leave France either for they love it too much to think of emigration. There is only one shop in Coisy – about half the size of Mrs Wylie’s in Hillston, and a one-roomed public estaminet. No shop windows of any kind! No local advertising or anything as in an Australian village of the same population! If a Hillston or Booligal shop or\n\n(C)\n\nhotel were transplanted here it would be the wonder of the town.\n\nTo us the French country people seem dirty personally. They are extremely provincial. For example the people with whom I am billeted are about the most prosperous in the town, yet they have never seen the sea only about 40 miles away. They are as religious as they are provincial, for even in the filthiest, narrowest-alleyed villages and without any lighting or other municipal systems so common to us there is always a square and a magnificent Church – some quite modern, some as ancient as France. And as one enters any village the first thing seen is a huge crucifix as high as a telegraph pole with a life sized model of Christ nailed thereon, and there are generally a few similar ones scattered over the village, especially along the road to the cemetery.\n\nIt looks gruesome at night time to run against a cross with spikes in feet and hands, and even red paint for the blood. They are everywhere.\n\n(D)\n\nAs for recreation for the people there seems to be none at any time. For instance in the villages I have been in there is not a single hall of any kind although some of the villages contain 2000 people. We wanted a hall for the Company Xmas dinner but had to put up with a small school room of about 30-child power. The French people wondered at our asking about a hall and asked us if we thought we were in Paris.\n\nBattalion Hqrs offered £30 as the hire of a piano for 10 days at Xmas and to leave £100 as guarantee to return it in perfect order, but there was no piano anywhere in the villages near here, villages containing over 10,000 people. Efforts to get one in Amiens also failed.\n\ntarte aux prunes\n\nFruits (poires et pommes)\n\nVins – Madiere, Bordeaux, Champagne\n\nCafé et Rhum Liqueur\n\nCigars et cigarettes.\n\nThe following were present.

Madame Pauline Eaffet wrote in my autograph book –\n\n\"En Souvenir de plusiers bonnes soirées passées à Coisy avec les Officiers de 13e Battailion Australien.\n\nUne petite amie de l’Australie.\n\nLe 31 Xbre 1916.\"\n\nUpon reaching Ribemont this evening we were fortunate in getting our old billet and\n\nwere most warmly welcomed by Madame Desplechin and her family – the children running to hug and kiss us. Very pleasing to be so welcomed when billetted on people in a foreign country. We are all very generous with tobacco for Madame’s husband, lollies and francs for the children but there is something more in our welcome here than money would buy.\n\nThe father of these children is home from Verdun on 10 day’s leave. He has been fighting since the beginning and is spending his leave by working 12 hours a day in a woollen mill to earn some money.\n\nEntry","58":" ‘17\n\nCamped in Nissen-bow-huts at Mametz, the scene of terrible fighting during the Somme battle. Arrived here late yesterday from Ribemont. Every soldier \nif\n who has spent any time on the Western Front remembers only too well the marches out and the marches in again, the marches back when the Brigade, on account of being so severely cut up, was taken \nright\n out of the line for a month or six weeks in order to be built up again – the Battalion by reinforcements, the old members of it by an organised rest in fairly\n\ndecent billets, and the march back again to the forward area. We called them all \"Marches\", although the journey up to the line area,\nand into the line\n then up into the trenches, and from the trenches back with sore feet to the forward huts, and then back again to some shattered town were really \"straggles\" and not by any means \"marches\". We started out from Ribemont in fours – after cleaning up the billets, and practically the town – we always get the job of cleaning up billets after other people before we occupy them, and of cleaning them up still more thoroughly before we leave them, because the \"old Brig\" makes pretty detailed inspections and any material or rubbish left behind brings straffing right down from the \"Brig\" to the Corporal per medium of Colonel, Adjutant, Captain, Lieut, \nand\nC.S.M. and Sergeants to \"eyewash\"\n\nthe \"Brig\". I have seen tens of thousands of rounds of S.A.A., hundreds of bombs, and scores of pieces of equipment dumped down wells to get them out of sight, as there was not sufficient room on transport to carry them and a \"straffing\" would ensue if they were left behind.\n\nCrossing the Albert-Amiens railway line near Dernancourt, the whole brigade was soon winding its way in single file almost knee deep in sloppy slush along the new \nand\n hastily-made roads beyond Méaulte and Albert. As I have said, we started out from Ribemont in fours and marched well past the \"heads\" at the \"Starting Point\" (generally some distance from the billets) but the tremendous traffic – motors of every description or beyond description from the huge lumbering lorry to the signaller’s bike, great\n\ncaterpillar tractors, steam engines and rollers, wagons, smoking hundreds of company cookers with their grimy but cheeky-looking cooks preparing the next meal for the companies while they moved along the road, hundreds of horse-teams with their batteries, countless A.S.C. wagons, pack-mules, horses and limbers; lancers with their long lances controlling traffic, mess-carts, a general and his staff well-mounted, miles of pioneers ladling slush off the road with long handled ladles, digging drains and widening the road without interfering with the traffic that had so continually splashed them that they had come to look like slush themselves, a dead-mule cart hurrying to shift a mule that had fallen dead from exposure and exhaustion – all soon lengthened out the Battalion into irregular lumps,\n\nthese lumps into still more irregular lumps, these into fours here and threes or twos there, and so on until the whole brigade was practically in single straggle. Everyone and everything doing something in the big show, silently and seriously, the only sounds being the spiteful barking of our anti-aircraft batteries near the old German lines at Fricourt, the thundering of a naval gun from some trucks on that newly constructed railway, the buzzing of aeroplanes somewhere, the hideous cries of a \ndonk\nmule, the slish-slosh, slish-wok, slish-wok, slishwok, slishwok of the churning of the churned slush by feet, hoofs and wheels of every description, and a brass band across on the other road.\n\nBut the only sound\nheard\n noticed by all was the music of this band of the Guards. They were going back from the trenches for a rest\n\nand although their road was as slushy as ours they marched in a perfect column of fours, albeit with heavy packs, bruises, chafes, frost bitten and swollen feet. \"Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty\" was taken up by our lads, and also \"Keep the Home-fires Burning:\".\n\n\"They’re good,\" muttered a digger near me.\n\n\"My Oath!\" replied another with emphasis.\n\nAs the two roads came close together near \"The Circus\", the Guards came under a rapid fire of interrogations from the diggers.\n\n\"Zay choom aa ee got a Woodbine aat o work abaat ye?\"\n\n\"Hullo Jock! Have you seen a war knocking about anywhere?\"\n\n\"Say mate could you keep one down?\"\n\n\"Cheerio Scotty!\",\n\nThese and dozens\n\nof other and more original, if unexpressible, remarks greeted the \"Tommies\". Then the slishwok, slishwok, slishwok, spiteful barkings of the same guns, the crunching of gravel under the slush and of metal under the steam roller, and the buzzing of planes\nsoon\n only soon were heard – but only heard unconsciously as the men dreamily trudged and splashed on.\n\nThere was no conversation, singing or whistling but just the rhythmic, monotonous grinding and squelching interspersed with these hundred other subconsciously heard sounds.\n\nI spoke to \"Fin\", the elderly man, whose feet had been giving him trouble for some time. Although aged 40 he had always been one of the most cheerful soldiers I know.\n\n\"How are things old chap?\"\n\n \n\n\"Pretty good, sir, but I’m hoping my feet ‘ll hang out till we’ve done this turn in. I’m not as young as I used to be, and my circulation is not too good, so my feet are all numb and swollen now for over a week.\n\n\"You must go to the M.O.\"\n\n\"When we come out, sir. They’ll be O.K. this time, Stan here will rub them to night for me and give them some whale-oil\" +\n\nWe splashed on for another half-hour when someone ventured \"What did we come to this bloody show for?\"\n\n\"Here’s Goldy got another brainwave\"\ntwo others\n someone exclaimed.\n\n\"He’s always getting brainwaves\" added\nanother\n a second \n\n\"Goldy came because it’s safer here than in\n\n(+ \"Fin\" was Pt Finnigan, secretary of P.L.L. at Canbelego.

Goldy was proud of being an original member of his battalion, and never missed an opportunity of referring to the fact.\n\nAt last we straggled into our huts in what was once Mametz Wood, but now there is hardly a stump to see. \n\nOur huts! Imagine a long rusty cylindrical tank split lengthways into two equal parts; put floors and lining into them and you have two of our huts. There are hundreds of them arranged in lines and the whole is called MELBOURNE, as the notice board at the entrance tells us. Within a few miles we afterwards find \nAdelaide\n, \nSydney\n, \nBrisbane\n, \nPerth\n, \nHobart\n, \nBendigo\n and other \n\nSouthern Cross cities. Little Bourke Street is a row of dugouts along the sides of a sunken road, a group of old German dugouts now inhabited by Cornstalks is Woolloomoolloo, rightly or wrongly spelt, the best dugout in this batch glorying in the signboard \"Potts’ Point\". A tent camp is pointed out as \"Daceyville\".\n\nNo sooner are we in our \"split tanks\" than we are served out with a liberal helping of hot Maconochie, which puts even the most inveterate grumbler into a good humor. After this meal our corporal takes the orderlies to get coal and another blanket for each man. While he is away all wonder if the C.S.M. has received the rum and what the ration of it will be.\n\nEntry","60":" Noon\n\nIn Bn. Officers’ Mess at Mametz, the scene of terrible fighting during the Somme Battle. Arrived here","61":" Explored yesterday several old German trenches. It is hard to believe that there was ever a town here where the map shows Mametz. The old buildings are now road metal. There were several villages near here in this prosperous district whose sites can now only be seen by looking at the roads nearby. Walking along what was once the main street one flounders into shell holes of mud and slush. I went for a walk yesterday through Mametz site with Captain Murray, DSO, DCM. He is most interesting to be with and keeps one moving.\n\nThe first night in these huts some\nGerman\n shells passed over us and we get a few each evening\nnear us\n near us that are aimed at a railway nearby. A heavy bombardment has been going on up the line since noon yesterday. I visited Albert yesterday with Lt Gordon Mills (of Bourke), Bn. Mess Secretary to purchase provisions. Rode in Donkey Mess Cart. Bought 8 dozen eggs for 32 francs. Capt. Rettie, E.C. Padre, has joined the Battalion.\n\n \n\n\"A\" Coy is camped at Montauban guarding a dump and unloading trucks. There is a big dump there of shells, barbed wire, duckboards, coal, bombs and ammunitions of all kinds. As they are guarding! the coal dump we take the liberty of sending up a limber every night for a load of coal for the rest of the Battalion. The \"Tommy\" officer in charge of the dump became suspicious about the guard and the coal and one night during the week he paid a surprise visit and saw the coal walking away as fast as the diggers could take it. He ordered the guard to fire, but they refused, making some Australian excuses. He put \nsome\none under arrest, but as the coal is for the good of the Battalion – Colonel and all – the man won’t suffer. Capt. Harry Murray is O.C. \"A\" Coy. \"B\" Coy is engaged in salvaging dugouts, as the timber is valuable. A Corporal of","62":" Bn. Was killed yesterday at this work.

My wildest imagination never came up to what is going on now. The cannonading has been heavy and practically continuous for the past 3 days. When our big gun just near us booms it shakes things up generally. The noise is like 500 thunderstorms arguing together as to which can make the greatest noise. And the lightning is not wanting either for there is not a second without hundreds of vivid flashes from the mouths of all sizes of gun.\n\n \n\nKeen on his canteen. To see him getting about one would never guess he was a Brigadier, unless he knew his face which is strikingly strong. He is always known by his old sheep-skin, – a jerkin made out of several pieces of ordinary sheep skin. His Brigade Major or Staff Captain are often to be seen following him with bundles of newspapers for the troops.\n","64":"\n\nOn Fatigue Work clearing an old German Trench and making it into a leading drain for several roads. Very sticky and heavy work. The Tommy Engineer in charge of the work stated that the 13th Bn. worked better than any other troops he had ever had working for him. Snow fell from 10.30 am to 1 pm. We had snowball fights, officers and men together. I visited Fricourt where salvaging of German dugouts is still in progress and was surprised at the great number and size of these – many capable of holding 200 bunks and with\ninstall\n electric light and fan installations.\n\nA Corporal of 16th Bn. was killed salvaging timber from these dugouts.\n\nVisited with Padre Rettie King George Hill. Here there is a notice board where King George stood to observe part of the Somme Battle. There was a tremendous struggle here in the early part of the Somme push. Two large mines had exploded leaving immense craters. Without seeing this hill we could never imagine the tremendous battering it must have had as evidenced by the levelled trenches and thousands of shell holes. Many graves here, both British and German, also a German cemetery. \n\nInspection of huts today by Brig-Gen. Brand and Col Durrant. Played Bridge after mess with Major Marks, Lt Mills & Doc Shirlow, lost 5 francs. My little ‘Merlie’s birthday. I sent her some postcards.\n","65":" – 8.45 pm\n\nHave just supervised the issue of rum to our Company – a nightly job since coming to the forward area.

Drake-Brockman (16th)\nand\n and Peck (14th) and Major Wilton were among the visitors.\n\nLt \"Yank\" Perray was in good form, told several yarns and sang. All present (29) signed my autograph book. Among the yarns told were the following :-\n\nYarn – A soldier of","69":" Bn. Was on Traffic Duty along the busy road passing this camp. It was important to keep traffic controlled and to the right of the road. The Grenadier Guards came along the middle of the road. \"Keep to the right\", Billyjim ordered. \"We’re the Grenadier Guards!\"\n\n\"Keep to the right then!\"\n\n\"We’re the Guards!\"\n\n\"Well I don’t care if you’re \nbloody\n engine drivers you’re got to keep to the right\". He had his way too.\n\nWhen the Brig heard this from Col. Durrant he remarked \"That man ought to be made a Lance-Corporal\".\n\nYarn – Our men raided Fritz’s trench the other night and captured half-a-dozen Bosches, among\nthem\n them being a real German corporal, who resented being captured by \"Australians\". He strenuously objected to being led back to our lines and refused to come. Two diggers lugged him in spite of his struggling. However they were still in No Man’s Land when the time came near for our barrage to start and it became necessary to reach our lines quickly. Still Fritz Corporal struggled.Then No 1 Billyjim took a Mills’ Bomb, \nfrom\nwithdrew the pin and dropped it in Fritz’s pocket. Then leaving the latter to himself he called out \"Run like hell Bill, I’ve put a turnip in his pocket.\"\n\nWhen they next looked over the parapet there was no sign of the bombastic corporal.\n\n19th Jan\n\nEverything still covered with snow. Plenty of snowballing and snow fighting enjoyed by all. I was Prosecutor in F.C.M. on","70":" but had nothing to do. I also\n\nmet my brother George (54th Bn.) at Adelaide Camp, before he went into the line. He was 24 on","71":" – very cheerful.\n\nUnloading sleepers this morning, and drainage work this afternoon. Tried my gas mask in a room full of tear gas. It is quite OK.\n\nDuring this morning I asked 10 men to push 8 loaded railway trucks along the line. They didn’t think they could move them and were very much surprised when they did the job easily. One wit exclaimed \"Blime, if we can do that on Bullybeef, what would we do on Steak and Onions for breakfast\". \"There’d be no work for locomotives\" said another.\n","72":"\n\nLeft Mametz this morning with Lts Mills & Parsonage to examine the front positions we are soon to take over. We rode to Montauban Camp and left our horses with \"A\" Coy. Then had a long walk alonf miles of duckboards through Delville Wood with its hundreds of still unburied bodies – German and South Africans mainly – to Brigade and Bn. Hqrs. From here with a runner to guide us we set out\n\nto visit our support\ntrenches\n and reserve trenches. The runner got off his track – everything being the same with snow. Going over the ridge near Switch Trench behind Flers we passed the place where four Tommies had been decapitated by one of their own shells just skimming the ridge, the shell being from a gun in the valley towards Delville Wood. We passed near heavy shell fire to Bull Road where we were directly and accurately shelled. Upon returning we had just started when two shells almost got us; the first passed over our heads and lobbed just in front, while the second coming simultaneously lobbed about 5 yards from me. Fortunately the last was a \"dud\" – the only \"dud\" we had seen that afternoon. Very tired when we reached Montauban again. Here we messed with \"A\" & \"D\" Coys. The roads were frozen so hard that our horses had difficulty in keeping their feet even when walking slowly.\n\n \n","73":"\n\nTook communion this morning. Walked to Adelaide this afternoon on the chance of seeing my brother George of 54th Bn. But he had gone up to the line. A reinforcement of 79 men arrived here. A Zeppelin passed over us tonight in the darkness.\n","74":"\n\nThe Bn. Moved up to Switch and Gap Trenches South and East of Flers. I went forward to take over from a Company of 45th Bn. in Gap Trench. Met Lt. Terrace coming out near Quarry Siding and Capt \"Tubby\" Allan in Gap Trench. Took over and signed for Trench stores – Pumps, bombs, picks and shovels.\n\nst","75":"\n","76":"\n\nIn Gap Trench with shells – both our own and German – whistling & screaming through the air over us and occasionally \"putting the wind up us\". One gets used to anything. I always had a keen dislike to crawling into narrow holes or dark places where I had to remain in a stooping attitude. I remember how I disliked crawling through a low narrow passage 1200 feet down in a West Wyalong mine, but here I am as happy as a rabbit in a good burrow. I also know how a rabbit must feel when he knows\n\nhe is very likely to be \"potted\" if he goes out. However we rabbits are cheerful bunnies; four of us cuddled up last night in the one pair of blankets and it was \"no bon\" for the two outsiders. Although we call this a dugout it has only a sheet of iron and one layer of sandbags on top – just about shrapnel-proof. We have no water here until the dugout gets a bit warm when the frozen roof thaws\nand\n gives us a shower and puts out our candles. I wear a balaclava cap and each morning it has icicles around its mouth.\n\nHad a nasty fall on the ice this morning. My fountain pen is frozen and I have continually to warm it against the candle to make it run. The water in my water bottle is always frozen. Capt. Wells, my O.C. says to write a description of our dugout. Impossible! He and Freddie Doust are playing with their toes, trying to make them warm. A candle is stuck on to a sandbag, and a small fire – small! very! – smoking our eyes to tears and our faces black. We are all longing for a condensed-milk tin of water to sponge our eyes and faces with. We would be laughed at to\n\nmention that we thought of a real dish of water. Our bread\nis\n on the floor in the corner among our socks and boots, tin hats, towels\nand\n cheese and jam, is absolutely frozen as hard as a rock, so hard that we have to hack it with a bayonet. Jim Cooney – a splendid chap and one of our party – has just bumped his head on the iron roof. He knelt up too high. He is naturally swearing at everything in general from the dugout to the Kaiser, so our home is quite warm for the present. I must sit on the doorstep now – half-in and half-out while he makes his bed. We take it in turns to sit out of the road. I started to make a new dugout yesterday but after digging into the\nside\n bottom of the sunken road about 6 inches I came upon a dead Fritz. Digging in another direction we found another one, so I decided to remain in this 4’ x 6’ dugout with the other three officers. Some diggers however finished what I had started, and after \nplacing a few duckboards\n filling up the floor and placing a few duckboards on it they are now as happy as Larry in a \"broken\" dugout.\n","77":"\n\nKaiser Bill’s birthday and he has been getting plenty of \"hurry up\" all day. A cheeky Taube came over us but fell with a beautiful wallop for one of our \"Archies\" got him at a tremendous height. He plunged down nose first with a sharp streak of flame from his tail. The weather is very fine – plenty of ice and snow, but, thank goodness, no mud or slush. We see the sun pretty well every day lately. Our men make fun of everything,\nwhen shells\n.When shells come close and we are all ducking vigorously someone calls out \"Now look out Fritz or you’ll be hurting someone\". A chap gets a lot of dirt blown into his dinner and exclaims \"You ----- ------ ----- Fritz!\"\n\nTwo men were carrying a plank yesterday when a shell caught it, splintering it to pieces. They picked up the fragments for firewood for their dugout braziers to the great envy of their mates for it’s not always easy to get nice firewood. \"I thought we were getting a Blighty out of that\", said one. \"Our luck’s dead out!\" replied his mate.\n\nThe C.S.M.\ngave\n issued a loaf for 4 men.\n\n\"Is this for the four in this possie?\" one asked the C.S.M. and being told it was, remarked \"We’re in luck’s way for Jim’s just gone to hospital\".

Our men are feeling very tired, but they are simply fine and in good spirits. Their morale is excellent and far superior to Fritz’s. Unfortunately there is more in this game than the personal element, and rotters who cause\n\nsupplies or anything else to be delayed whether they are capitalists or I.W.W. extremists want quick shooting. The men here are practically unanimous against having conscripts to help them. I have spoken with hundreds and they are all the same. They are a bonny lot of cheerful grumblers; the less they have to do the more they grumble; the more they have to do and the harder the time they are having the more cheerful they make out they are.\n\n-Our dugout is 4 feet high in its highest part and slopes down to 3 feet and is 6 feet long by 4 wide. We can only crawl, lie or sit in it. At present one officer is shaving in one corner with a candle stuck on a bayonet stuck in a sandbag; another is sleeping after night work similar to my own; the third is looking for a way to get out without knocking the shaver, waking the sleeper or knocking over my Arnott’s Cake Tin in which I am soon to have a bath. Not that he worries much about disturbing any of us, but if he knocks the shaving pot over it falls on to his own blanket, and if he\n\nbumps my bath it will spill on his overcoat upon which rest my bare feet to keep them off the\nfrozen\n freezing floor. So he has to be very careful. My bath water consists of a few lumps of ice melted down.\n\nTalk about appetite. I can eat quite big lumps of fat now, a thing I could never do at home.\n","79":" – 11 pm\n\nA tremendous bombardment has been going on for some time.

We are all to wrap sandbags around our legs for puttees and over our boots to prevent the tramping sound being heard by Fritz for he is only 80 yards away in some parts. It is a good way to carry sandbags forward also. We are to have a two-minute barrage from the 18 pounders with forward bursting shrapnel. It starts at 10 pm,\nand\n under it we are to cross No Man’s Land, and at 10.12 pm when it lifts we are to hop into\nStormy\n Fritz’s trench – Stormy Trench – and prepare by consolidating, to hold on at all costs.

Every officer had his watch out. They had been synchronised during the day. There was a little tension all round for we were going into the unknown. Then a few guns barked out and the shells whizzed overhead. Some thought it was the barrage\nbut\n and made ready to get up. They were quickly whispered down but only for a couple of seconds for exactly on the tick of ten 1100 guns, including the famous Lahore Battery, belched out. Millions of spiteful snakes seemed to be hissing angrily above us and the air and earth just in front of us to be filled with sudden fiery spikey red and yellow balls of fire which glowed but for \nhalf\n a fraction of a second and went out, but not before their places were taken by others just as fierce and spikey. The Battalions as one man stood up and prepared to advance. In the glow of bursting shells it was a glorious and never-to-be forgotten sight – the whole battalion, except for \na\n carrying parties, in one long line, with officers spotted out in the gloom here and there just in the front. The\n\nmen were anxious to get across and had to be restrained. A hundred yards in two minutes. Never did two minutes seem so long. That wonderful line is half way across, those sudden fiery spiked fireballs are just ahead advancing also, the savage snakes are hissing overhead and yet one can feel the silence for there is not a word – only signs by officers waving their men back to keep them out of our own barrage. Then some fall into shell holes, some get caught on barbed wire, but never a word; others help them silently and they take up the line again. Then \"C\" Company bulges slightly ahead in one place, and a section is held up by obstacles in another. Several knots of loaded men are following us across; the carrying parties all heavily laden. Everyone is peering ahead to catch a glimpse of the German trench for we must be close to it now. Still our shells are sweeping into it and\n\nnow over it. Then the swish and hiss was heard \nsuddenly\n to lift as suddenly as it had begun. The two minutes were over. There is the trench not ten yards in front of us. Who got into it first no one knows. We were all searching bewildered German prisoners, calling on them to come up from their dugouts and dropping bombs down those which were slow in responding, pointing to where we had just come from and making the prisoners run back that way, all in what appeared to be much less time than the two minutes were.Then Company Commanders fired their green flares up to let those in the rear know they were in possession. And the German barrage came down. \nThe\n It was on us and over us. Capt McDonald falls, just as he fires his Success Flare. The 14th Bn. (Victorian mainly) who have occupied the trenches we have just left suffer heavily, these trenches being known to the enemy. When I saw them a few days later they were practically obliterated. \n\nThe German prisoners running back also caught it. Carriers and runners all won Victoria Crosses that night. There were calls for \"Stretcher Bearers\" everywhere and wonderfully they got there and did their work. Many with frightful wounds wait their turn patiently for the Stretcher Bearers are busy. Not a murmur of impatience except from a wounded German officer who cries out in agony and pleads to be attended to. His stomach has been cut right across with a bomb, and his intestines - ! He has to wait until our own men are attended to. Another German with his two feet smashed into a frightful mass of bloody leather, flesh and bone-pulp, sits uncomplainingly smoking a cigarette a digger has given him. A digger has also given him his water bottle.\n\nThese Germans and others were \nnot\n carried back to the M.O. the next night. We could not get them away sooner for many of our own men had to wait fifteen hours. All night long the enemy counter-attacked\n\nmainly on our flanks, especially against the right where Captain Murray had his glorious \"A\" Company. Attack after attack was beaten back with tremendous German losses. On this flank the Germans came from all directions showering egg stink bombs heavily, as well as being assisted by heavy barrages. Our own artillery was magnificent, the S.O.S. coming down accurately within half-a-minute when called upon.\n\nThe German egg-bombs being light and handy – weighing only 9 ozs – could be thrown 60 yards while our Mills Bombs weighing 22 ozs could only generally be thrown \nthe\n 30 to 40 yards. This disadvantage was overcome by having 6 inch rods screwed into the bases of the Mills’ and firing them out of rifles with blank cartridges when they carried up to 85 yards. We were one of the first battalions on the British Front to use them extensively this way.\n\nLieut George Bentley, \"A\" Coy was killed early on the morning of the","86":" Lts Trim, Pulling and Kell\n\nall of \"A\" Coy were wounded, Capt Murray and Lt. George Marfer being the only officers left in that Company. A piece of a 5.9 shell bursting close to him evidently penetrated Lt. Bentley’s heart. Lieut McDowell – quite a boy – had charge of his bombers on our left and made quite a name for himself. Capt Bone was in charge of \"D\" Coy on the left, with Lts. \"Tom\" Morgan and \"Will\"\nShirt\n Shirtley (Bluey) with him; Capt D.P.Wells had \"B\" Coy with Fred Doust, Jim Cooney and myself as his subs; Capt McDonald had Lts Lonagan and Turner with him in \"C\" Coy; and \"A\" Coy, as above mentioned, were on the extreme right. \n\n\"A\" Coy on the morning of the","87":" was 37 strong and had to be relieved that evening by a Company of Westralians from the","88":" Bn. The German bombardment, concentrated upon the 800 yards of trench captured, and aimed at us from three quarters of the points of the compass – for we were in a sharp salient – was\n\nX \n\nAt Enendecourt we met some of the cream of the German army and they can’t hold a candle to our men as fighters or for morale. We can do what we like with them man for man. They must surely begin to break up soon.\n\nOne has often to laugh even in critical circumstances at our men. We caught some very big Germans. The men had sworn what they were going to do when they got the \"blighters\", but when they put up their hands – and some of them knelt down with hands up -they seemed disappointed. \"The b-------- won’t give a bloke the chance to stick them\", I heard a man say. And our men won’t kill one unless in a fair fight. They give them cigarettes and generally patronise them. \"The poor blighters can’t help it\", is a common expression. The Germans all seemed quite happy to be captured.\n\nvery severe, experienced officers and men describing it as the heaviest the Bn. had ever been under. My platoon (17 effective men on account of a large carrying party being detailed) captured a German machine gun bombing post with big store of bombs and a Trench mortar for throwing Pineapple Bombs. We tried this mortar with good effect. The capture of, and holding on to, Stormy Trench, Enendecourt, was one of the\nfin\n smartest and finest pieces of work done so far in this war. The Germans well knew the value of it, and so were prepared to make the terrible sacrifices they did in their repeated counter attacks to regain it. It gave a view for miles to our rear, - right back to Delville Wood, and in our front we could see the outskirts of Bapaume. It \nwas\nis a splendid Observation Post for our artillery officers who \ncould\n can get on to German traffic on the road from Bapaume towards Le Sars, Le Barque and Warlencourt.\n\nThe food we got in the line was a credit to the A.I.F. Hot \ntherm\nThermos Cans brought up our stew every night – a thermos containing enough for 40 men. Water was the difficulty – lumps of ice being brought up one night in sand bags for our water.\n","89":"\n\nSettled down at La Chausee at","90":" Divisional School of Instruction – a general all round brush-up and a kind of supervised rest.

Posted home a set of midget vases\n\nand some views.\n\nHave had several long rides through the country around here – between Vignacourt, Amiens and Picquigny.\n\nThe weather is rapidly becoming warmer, and the snow and ice are thawing making things generally slushy. The whole place ought to be beautiful in about a month’s time as the trees are already beginning to bud, and most of the roads are bordered by long lines of ornamental trees. There is a wonderful contrast between these parts and the parts affected directly by the war. Here everything seems easy going and peaceful; there everything blasted – the trees splintered, even those two feet in diameter being smashed through with lumps of shells, the ground torn and torn again into immense holes, and broken houses and implements strewn on all sides.\n\nThe French get the name of being excitable but I have never met a more happy-go-lucky unexcitable lot in my life.\n\nThe monsieur of my billet works in a Chemical factory at Amiens.

Coffee is always ready apparently everywhere in France. It is made from the beans and the first thing one hears in the morning is the coffee grinder going. Pepper on the table has also to be ground over one’s meat by turning the top of the pepper-box around. Madame has just made coffee, or rather heated up what was made yesterday morning and \n\nhas poured me out a cup. I have never yet refused it for three weeks until this time and they can’t understand it. But while it was being heated up they boiled half-a-dozen eggs in it. I have told them I am not thirsty and they have put it back in the pot and will continue to offer it to me every quarter of an hour until they go to bed. I am generally studying when they retire.

We are quite proud of him as he has D.C.M. from Gallipoli; D.S.O. from Mouquet Farm and Pozieres; and now V.C. – a record for the A.I.F. – There is fairly general regret that Lt Geo Marper was not awarded a distinction for Stormy Trench.

The trip from London yesterday afternoon up the Valley of the Thames was delightful. One cannot help loving England. Everything is so beautiful in the country parts. I once had an idea that the whole of England was a large city with millions of chimney-stacks and miles of factory walls, but there are miles and miles of lovely fields and groves, and one can go hundreds of miles through beautiful country roads and districts without noticing a factory. Even many of the factories are garden factories, with recreation fields and sports grounds for the employees. Everything seems marvellously organised, from the London ‘buses to the smallest farm. The railways are splendid, fast yet smooth. I travelled from London to Didcot (Oxford Junction) with a fine old gentleman, with whom I had an interesting conversation about Australian politics, George Reid, Barney Wise (with whom he was at Oxford University) and\n\nDeakin and Hughes. As he left me he introduced himself as Sir Robert Buckle, Mayor of Oxford, and President of the Thames Conservation Board or something like that. This Board travels along the Thames every year to \nwatch\n look after its beauty & to prevent \"eyesores\" encroaching.\n\nFrom the high Beecham Cliff\na high cliff\n this evening I had some lovely views of Bath, the Avon valley and various snug little suburbs. It is regarded as one of the finest views in England & I certainly think it would be hard to beat it. A digger I was talking with in the train said to me \"This country is so well looked after and so much like a beautiful picture that I fell ashamed to throw a cigarette butt out of the carriage window\". We could make Australia a little more like a picture if our people were less careless with tram tickets, papers and picnic remains. I shall ever remember Bath as the grey city with tall spires and greenery backed by hills made more beautiful even than Nature by Art.\n","112":"\n\nLeft Bath 8.10 am. Spent 2 hours in Bristol walking about the streets which are extremely busy. There are great factories on all sides – tobacco, leather, iron and boot factories mainly – there are busy trains, loaded trucks and barges on canals in every direction.\n\nOn the journey from Bristol to Plymouth I had an interesting companion – one who is constantly travelling in connection with some war industry. He explained the whole journey to me. These Englishmen, when they get over their first reserve – some call it snobbishness but it isn’t except in a few cases – are exceedingly courteous and anxious to oblige us in every possible way. I viewed Athelney where Alfred the Great held out and where the country is still marshy; Bridgewater near where Sedgemoor was fought; Taunton famous or infamous for its connection with Judge Jeffrey’s Bloody Assizes; beautiful Exeter; the Exe Valley and Dartmoor. Raining heavily at Plymouth. Found J’s grandfather and Aunt. They were surprised & delighted to see me.\n","113":"\n\nSpent afternoon on Plymouth Hoe.

We marched from Paddington through Hyde Park, in front of Buckingham Palace and down Victoria Street to Horseferry Road Headquarters, a lot of filthy prostitutes (who appeared mostly foreign) endeavouring to join up with the troops whom they knew were new chums on their first visit to London. It’s a damnable shame that the British Establishment doesn’t do something drastic with these street prostitutes.\n\nAt Headquarters the men received a lecture on \"What Not to Do in London and How to Do it\" and \"Blue Light Treatment\".\n\nI visited St Paul’s Cathedral for an hour. It was more beautiful today in the bright sunlight than when I saw it previously during a dull winter day. I then visited the Tower of London where I met a party of Australians and Canadians among whom were Capt (Dr) Cos Fowler, Lt Les Fowler and \"Abdul\" a Canadian. Some Australians were shocking the \"Beefeaters\" by trying on ancient suits of armor and mounting the models of horses with lances in hand, but a few shillings made matters right. We then taxied to York Hotel, saw crowds of American Nurses being driven in drags around London, visited \"Ye Olde Mitre\" in Chancery Lane, dined at the Australian Officers’ Club and finished the evening at Savoy Theatre where Henry Irving was playing \"The Bells\" and \"Waterloo\".

One holds his meat down with a fork while the other cuts it, one pulls one side of a knot in a bootlace while the other pulls the other side.\n\nReg told me of a Captain Taylor? of 19th Bn. who when they got into difficulties at Lagnicourt said \"Well what about surrendering, boys?\". \"Not while we’ve got a bomb or a bayonet, Sir\", was the reply. This so heartened the Captain, that a great and very successful defence was put up. Another of Reg’s section was to be crimed for something serious. He applied and had it allowed to stand over until after the battle. Reg saw his body hanging on the German\n\nbarbed wire, with both legs blown off.

I had met him previously at the 4th Divisional School at La Chauseé in France. After booking my room at the Royal Hotel, College Green, Goninon and myself went to the Zoo to the United Kingdom Commercial Travellers’ Assoc. Sports, which were held in the Zoo grounds. These sports were simply like Sunday School Picnic Sports. There were dozens of sideshows and a fine Merry-go-Round, all of which took pennies and twopences, tickets being pressed upon us by dozens of girls who would not be denied. The proceeds were for War Invalids.\n\nLeaving the Sports, Goninon & myself taxied to The Centre for afternoon tea – raspberries and cream, cake, bread, butter and a pot of tea – all for 1\/- each, rather reasonable. Then the Pictures occupied us for an hour. Dinner at St Stephen’s Hotel for 4\/9 each. We then taxied back to the Sports at the Zoo, threw balls at Coconuts for 1d a shot, fired pea rifles, and saw the \"Three Smallest People in the World\". G. met a young lady so I returned to my hotel, read a few papers and went to bed.\n\nSunday 15th July\n\nHad a cup of tea in bed; bath and breakfast, finishing breakfast at 10.40 am. A heavy thunderstorm then came up. After it cleared away, I went in a motor bus to Avonmouth, but the Docks were closed to visitors. It is a very pleasant trip from Bristol to Avonmouth – about 6 miles for 6d. I then had a few tram rides, and on one I met a gentleman named Holman, and his wife, of Barry in Wales. He is connected with shipbuilding. He was just recovering from\n\nthe effects of Drunkenness. I joined them in afternoon tea at \"The Swan\". I had intended spending the night in Bath, but this delayed me; so I booked a room at \"The Swan\".\n\n16th July – Monday\n\nAt Codford. – Left Bristol at 6 am and arrived ay Wylye at 8 & motored \nto Codford\n to camp.

Slept in Sunday until 9.30; then after breakfast, I went for a walk thro’ the Park in the City. Left for Bournemouth at 2 pm.

I knew by their accent they were not, but questioned them as to where they came from. They replied \"Sydney\".\n\n\"What State is Sydney in?\" I asked.\n\n\"I guess you’ve got us beat, sir!\" one replied. So out they had to come.\n\nI have met and yarned with a great many Americans, especially at Southampton and Harve and on the \ntransport\nChannel transport, and they seem to be a very splendid body indeed.

I then took a bus to North London and another to Crouch End. A fair walk brought me to Mrs and Miss Spears – the latter my mother’s cousin – Address 31 Crescent Road, Crouch End, London, N8. I was made very welcome indeed and had tea there. Returning to London I went to a theatre and saw Gaby Deslys in \"Suzette\" – a very pleasing performance.

We had an enjoyable walk along the cliffs and hills near the sea, & then returned to a good dinner; - Welsh lamb and Somerset Cream being the \"Specials\". After dinner Dr. L-Jones gave me half a dozen cigars and then motored me around for about 1½ hours. Returning to Longford Bay Hotel we put my portmanteau on the car; then motored into Swansea very quickly to catch the 5.15 train back to Codford.\n\nI got a \"through to Salisbury\" car & so was comfortable to Codford.

Walked about the Streets – some very fine streets and buildings – an extremely busy port. A few fine Boulevardes. Changed £9 into francs. Trammed to St Adresse beach. Went to \"Revue\" after dinner, but it did not start until 9.10 pm & my last tram to Camp was at 10. So I saw only one part. Got lost among the Camps returning to","195":" Div.

Train which consists of 50 troop trucks and carriages with broken doors and windows. The troops include English, Scotch Welsh Australians and Indians. The day is delightful and the country beautiful. We have boots, coats and collars off as it is rather warm. The Seine – a beautiful and large stream – looks well and is quite crowded with small steam vessels and barges.\n\nWe arrived at Rouen about 7 this morning, went to a barber’s for a wash and shave, and then to Officers’ Club, but as they were extremely slow there getting breakfast, Willis (Jock, a Lieut of 15th Bn.) and myself went to a small restaurant and had a French breakfast – coffee, bread, butter and cheese.\n\nI then visited the Palais de Justice, Cathedral, St Etienne (a suburb about 4 miles out and a very poor quarter), Hotel de Ville, Eglise St Ouen (a magnificent but dirty and neglected structure). All these buildings, especially the Cathedral, are wonderful. I walked around the interior balcony, and exterior walk on the roof of l’Eglise St-Ouen and had some splendid views, - several churches, the tower where Joan of Arc was imprisoned, the Seine and its shipping, several bridges,\n\ngardens and busy streets. Lunched at Hotel Bordeaux – a poor lunch with sour cider which I unfortunately changed for sour wine and paid 3 francs extra.\n\nAgain walked the streets,\nbought a few trinkets\n visiting the Old Market Place where Joan of Arc was burned and slept for an hour at the Officers’ Club before catching the train. 1500 troops are on this train.\n","200":"\n\n6 pm. Still Troop Train, passing through most beautiful country, - plenty of hay, apple and pear orchards, dairies and timber groves.\n","201":"\n\nIn Troop Train. Just passed through Calais where we waited 30 minutes for breakfast, - bully beef, biscuits and tea. Am feeling very dirty and sleepy. As O\/C Train I was on duty all last night and although I tried to snatch short sleeps I was continually being awakened by R.T.O’s and French railway officials. The French seem great muddlers with these trains. Either that or the British and French Authorities don’t work together smoothly. At Abbeville, 11 pm, the French took off the truck containing\nofficers\n kits and shunted it on to another line. Finding this out just in time I awakened 20 men to carry them back to another truck on our train.\n\nThis truck was also shunted off at Étaples. Then the train started without myself and 12 men who were again removing kits to another truck in our train. This was at 4 am. However we made a fuss with the Frenchman in charge of the yards and stopped our train.\n\nAbout a Battalion of Portuguese marched into the siding at Étaples while we were there. They seem to be dressed in French Uniforms with British steel hats, rifles and webb equipment. They are a small but rather blocky lot and all look very pasty.\n\nThe country we are now passing through between Calais and Belgium is very low, level and marshy with plenty of old-fashioned windmills like ones seen in Dutch scenes. Apples and pears grow well, and there are large fields of silver beet, hay and lucerne. Hedges line the roads and fields. The roads are very good especially considering the low, marshy country. Why can’t we have roads equal to these near Brewarrina, Bourke, Hay and Jerilderie. I remember seeing dozens of empty trucks going out on our railways to these places. As they all pass good stone country it seems a shame that even a single truck should\n\ngo out back without a load of metal. Our roads then might be equal to these in say a century.\n\nRed-tiled houses predominate and give such a touch of color to the already beautiful scenery. The French children are, and have been since daylight, along the line calling out \"Bullee beef! & Beescet!, Souvenir! Pennee! Cigarette!\" They are like the Kaffir children at Durban and the \"Gyppoes\" for begging.\n\nThe French women and children do a great deal of field work, while a good many French soldiers can also be seen working in the fields. Small boys – even those only 3 or 4 – smoke cigarettes with great deliberationsand apparent enjoyment.\n\nThere are canals and drains everywhere, - they are necessary to drain these low fields.\n\nI placed two \nAustralians, two Socotties\n diggers, two Jocks and three Tommies under open arrest for stealing apples from a French garden near which the train stopped, but seeing that the \"Jocks\" and \"Tommies\" were so broken up at the thought of having a crime against them when they marched into their units\n\nI released them all after a short lecture on the seriousness of robbing our allies. I could hardly keep from smiling at the very serious manner of the Jocks & Tommies compared with the nonchalance of the diggers. I am sure the latter read me like a book. Upon my telling them they were quite free and that nothing further would be done in the matter, the Tommies and Jocks, - two of them with tears in their eyes – came up and thanked me most sincerely.\n","202":"\n\n2.30 pm. In the Owl Trench, a Support Line between Messines and Gapaard Farm. Arrived here last night about 9.30 from Locre after resting at Drouancourt near the Belgian Border. Coming into the line we all had hot cocoa and milk at Brigade Headquarters, the old \"Brig\" himself supervising the issue. Lieuts McKillop (Bob), Cleland (Les), Westwood (Joe), Merifield (Meri) and myself are here in a cellar of a smashed Belgian farm through which our trench passes. Our men have three German \"pillboxes\" for dugouts. We were sniped at coming in but\n\nhad no casualties. Fanny’s Cut, the communication trench leading in, is fairly dry but a good deal knocked about. This trench is knee deep in water for about 60 yards. We are continually revetting and duckboarding it but it falls in again very quickly. Raining heavily.\n\nI am in charge of carrying parties, carrying rations, water, bombs, barbed-wire, corrugated iron, stakes, duckboards and \"A\" frames to the Support and Outposts. Last night was comparatively quiet here but there was tremendous straffing on either side of us – down near Warneton and up towards Hollebeke. \n\nEarly this morning he gave us plenty of \"rumjars\" and \"pineapples\" but ceased as soon as our heavy stuff retaliated.\n","203":"\n","204":" pm. In Owl Trench Headquarters. Several aeroplanes are overhead – our own and enemy. One enemy ‘plane comes repeatedly over us every morning very gamely indeed as it flies quite low down. It is evidently armored as we have often fired at it without result.\n\nHave been salvaging rifles, overcoats, box respirators, P.H. helmets, picks, shovels, ammunition, bombs, panniers, steel helmets and\n\ndozens of other useful articles today. There are thousands of pounds worth of salvage lying about on every side. We buried several Germans and one of our \"unknown\" men, \napp\n evidently killed here over a month ago and partly buried by shells.\n\nOur dugout is inside a cellar of an old farm which has been blown to pieces on top of it, thus forming a good head cover. It is supported by German elephant iron for it was once a German Headquarters nicely fitted out even with electric light. Raining heavily.\n\nThe trenches are very smelly and sloppy. Capt H Browning arrived last night and took charge of \"C\" Company. Major Marks arrived to take charge of the Bn. today.\n\nReceived letters from home. Wrote J. & my parents.\n","205":"\n\nRather a quite day, interspersed however with bursts of artillery, both our own and enemy. I cleaned, examined and reset 8 boxes of Mills Bombs and rifle grenades. They were caked in mud to such an extent as to be hardly recognisable. There must be thousands of bombs and shells\n\n \n\nunder the mud. The Belgian farmers of the future are sure to have accidents when ploughing as no matter how well the place may be cleaned up there will still be hundreds of bombs and shells just under the ground waiting for a bump to start them off.\n\nInspected this evening a new place for a Mule Dump. The Mule train brings up rations every night to a Dump and my party then man-handle these to cook-houses which are situated in German cement block-houses or \"pill-boxes\". Twelve casualties last night. I am slightly \"chatty\" today. Writing to J.\n","206":"\n\nHeavy straffing of our right front line by enemy artillery and minnies? Ours replied in retaliation three times today. Luckily but few casualties. Cleaned bombs and ammunition. Three enemy ‘planes over us this evening. We fired at them with Lewis Guns and rifles but with no apparent result. We improved our trench a good deal today, sandbagging the junction of Fanny’s Trench and Owl Trench.\n\nHere two of 14th Bn were sniped last night, just as I left them, one getting a bullet in his shoulder and the other through his ear. Our trench was shelled heavily early this morning just after the ‘planes returned to the German side. I am ‘chatty’ today more than yesterday and expect to be more so tomorrow as I have several nits on my singlet. Our mule-train is very windy? and don’t like waiting at the dump to be loaded with salvage. Two mules and one driver were hit last night by machine gun bullets which sweep low all over this area by bursts throug out each night. We generally hear his \"rat-a-tat\" swinging around his \nsegment\n sector of fire and get down as he swings towards us, but the mules have to stand where they are generally with drivers on the far side of them.\n\nThe 15th Bn erected a cross over their late acting C.O., Major Mondell’s grave near this trench and other crosses over men of their Bn. wo were killed near here just before we came in. Two","207":" Bn. mn killed near here were also buried and crosses erected over them. The weather is still good but very cold at night and early morning.\n\n \n","208":"\n\nHave just come in with my carrying party from carrying rations, water etc etc for about 5 hours in pitch darkness and heavy rain, slipping down thigh deep in shell holes \nagain and again\n and old trenches repeatedly, getting caught in remnants of German barbed wire entanglements, flopping down most ungracefully in the slush every time the enemy bullets swept across us or their shells screamed near, and unloading and loading mules.\n\nThe bread ration is almost saturated for the breadbags have all been not only in the rain but in shell holes and trenches full of water. Still we are a cheerful lot of grumblers, jokers and swearers. The darkness was made more inky after the vivid flares along the outposts and the big gun flashes every few seconds. Fritz has commenced pelting us with heavy stuff and \nhis\n is repeatedly putting out our candles. Our heavies are retaliating. A tremendous din. Still raining heavily. \nThe rum is ready to go to the outposts.\n","209":"\n\n3.30 am. The rum is ready to go to the outposts.\n\nIt is an extra trip for 8 carriers, but every man has volunteered, grumbling however the while, because they think it should have come up with the first mule train. They don’t know that, on account of submarines, the rum issue has failed for whole divisions,\nand yet\n nor the stupendous difficulties our transport had to get tonight’s issue.\n\nSergeant \"Jerry\" Oswald is a wonderful help to me in this carrying game. He deserves a D.C.M. for his work up here to say nothing of his cheerful swearing and grumbling at any one he suspects of loafing.\n\n\"Micky\" and \"Paddy\", as we call the two exceptionally big German \"minenwerfers\", have been worrying our outposts a good deal lately.\n\n28 Aug.\n\nIn Owl Trench near Eupaard Farm, below Messines. I have just returned from ration carrying. We had a very lively time as Fritz evidently saw our mule train coming over the ridge in the moonlight and gave us shells and machine gun bullets, hitting two mules but luckily missing my party.\n\nWe deepened our trench during the past few days, revetted and drained a good deal of it. Last night we were carrying kneedeep in water for considerable distances but our draining and duckboarding today made our track fairly dry for tonight. The parties carrying the rum to the outposts about 3 this morning had a very rough time as Fritz had a heavy machine gun and artillery barrage on and just over the outposts and along all communication trenches. However all the rum got there although a few men were wounded.\n\nA captain and corporal of the Manchesters have just been making preliminary arrangements for taking over from us tomorrow night.\n","210":"\n\nMidday – A party of diggers are at present having lunch against me in the trench. Their table, on which they have a loaf of bread, Anzac wafers, bully-beef and jam, is the leg of a dead German protruding into the trench and enclosed in a long trench boot. When widening the trench we came across this leg, and not liking to cut it off we left it protruding.\n\nThis morning as a German ‘plane crashed into the earth in flames incinerating the airmen, a digger remarked drily :- \"Well they’ve got a fine day for it, anyhow!\".\n","211":"\n\nLast night we were relieved by the 16th Manchesters. They began to come in after dark and kept dribbling in until after midnight. Every Australian felt quite sorry for these poor Tommies for they all had full packs up and many had extra loads as well, although the mud was sticky and kneedeep for hundreds of yards along their track. I could not help contrasting their silent, cheerless, heavy demeanor \nof them\n with the free and easy and light demeanor of the Australians going in last week. Although we were all thoroughly tired now, and especially footweary, there was a continual flow of cheery words from the Diggers to the Tommies. The Tommies occasionally replied cheerfully but they never took the initiative in making the cheery remarks. The Australians were wearing greatcoats and carrying waterproofs and some were carrying a blanket inside the waterproof.\nTjheir\n Our packs had been dumped at the Transport Lines. \nThey\n We were all bigger and stronger men than these Manchester Tommies, and yet although \ntheir\n our loads were less than half theirs we had found them extremely wearisome before we had reached the line going in, and they were\n\nparticularly burdensome now we were coming out so footweary and \nfatigued\n generally fatigued. We pitied in advance the Tommies coming out next week.\n\nTheir officers in the Support Line had valises and mess gear while our officers all carried on their persons the waterproof sheet\nand\n with occasionally a blanket therein. We were loaded the same as our men except that they carried rifle, ammunition and entrenching tool\nwhile\n instead of which we carried revolver, map case, prismatic compass, military stationery and a few carried field glasses.\n\nOur Brigade Canteen was busy all night supplying hot soup to the weary muddy diggers on their way out just on the edge of Messines. We had all reached Neuve Eglise by about 4 am and tossed ourselves down anywhere to sleep without thinking of the hardness or\ndirtiness of the billets\n the dampness of the tents and huts.\n\nThis morning we all had a glorious hot shower bath and a clean change of underclothing, - both much appreciated by all, - at the Palmer Baths. Since then we have all been scraping the mud off our clothes and boots, examining our packs, wearing our big felt hats instead of the steel helmets, cleaning and oiling our weapons and preparing for a long march\n\nback to Vieux Berquin tomorrow.\n","212":"\n\nBilleted at Verte Rue, S-W of Vieux Berquin, and against the Nieppe Forest. We had a tiresome, sloppy march, but are all in a good humor as it is reported we are out for three months’ rest.\n\nOn today’s march I had charge of the rearguard and had six prisoners awaiting trial by Court-Martial. They marched under fixed bayonets right through Bailleul, Merris and Vieux Berquin. I was ashamed of this job as we could very well have done without fixed bayonets advertising to troops and civilians of Bailleul the fact that some diggers had dodged the line or broken out of confinement.\n\nRejoined by Lieuts Turner and Parsonage.\n","213":"\n\nBilleted at Verte Rue\n\n1st September\n\nBilleted at Verte Rue. This evening I took a long walk into the Forest of Nieppe. It is very dense, low and \nbogg\nsodgy and interspersed in all directions with drains. A good deal of it is quite waterlogged. The old madam with whom we are billeted acts as our cook, and is quite delighted. She is a widow with 12 children, 2 sons already killed in action, 2 at present fighting, and one to go next month. Still she is quite cheerful. These French are so peculiar; a never ending source of interest. One cannot write a little about them as nothing short of a book could describe even the family here. A pretty little girl aged 9 has just been \"smoodging\" to me, and guessing she wanted something I asked her what it was. Judge my surprise when she replied \"A bottle of beer\". Her mother said it was all right as her children all liked beer and champagne better than chocolates we had given them. Her little boy – aged five – smokes cigarettes before her. Her daughter aged 20 has been cutting soldiers’ hair all this afternoon at half-a-franc each.\nKnowing\n As I act as interpreter, the mother asked me to tell the soldiers that her daughter had a fiancée and would not oblige but that she herself was quite willing. She told me this in front of her daughter, who never even dreamt of blushing. \n","214":"\n\nUp early this morning as we had to clean up billets, breakfast, and march a few miles to embus to go back to Lisbourg in the Fruges Area. \"C\" Coy was billeted for the night in the attic of an estaminet, and this morning when I went to","215":"\n inspect their billet before marching off, the Frenchman, who owned the place, made a tremendous fuss as the Diggers had stolen six bottles of champagne. I paid him the 60 franc he claimed so that we could get away without trouble, and I told the men it was up to them to make up this sum – about ½ franc a man. Later on they gave me the money adding that it was well worth 60 francs as they had drunk about 4 dozen bottles and had nailed up the cases again with the \"empties\" inside. They had not had time to nail up the half dozen seen by Monsieur.\n\nThe journey to Lisbourg today in 150 motor lorries for the Brigade was very interesting. The sun was shining brightly. The names\n\nof some estaminets we passed struck my attention.\n\nSome names were\n\n\"The Big Blackberry\"\n\n\"The Little Pinetree\"\n\n\"The Joyous Heart\"\n\n\"The Demure Christian\"\n\n\"The As-Good-As-Elsewhere\"\n\n\"The Red Cock\"\n\n\"The White Horse\"\n\n\"The Black Horse\"\n\nSaw an old woman of about 60 pulling a light plough while her old husband steered it.\n","216":"\n\nAt Lisbourg. Going to Brigade Pierrot Show in a few minutes. Weather fine but occasionally showery.\n\nThis afternoon we all played cricket after a good deal of trouble in finding\neven\n a piece of ground less rough than all the other pieces.\n\nThese people have done everything possible to please and make us comfortable. We are the first Australians they have seen and the first troops they have had billeted on them\n\nexcept some English troops who spent a few days here in 1914. We have been able to get plenty of eggs and milk – although at a price – eggs 4c each. My kiddies would love to find themselves in one of these villages for a while. There are hundreds of little pigs – little red ones mainly – calves, quiet old horses and cows. We see children aged 4 driving pigs out into the fields to feed in the morning and driving them back again in the evening after watching them all day. The women and children work very hard and for long hours. Whole families – babies & all – go out into the fields at sunrise taking a loaf of bread with them and return only after sunset.\n\nOne could never\nget to\n understand these people even slightly without living amongst them. Their naturalness is lovable. Old Madame Riehomme, with whom I am billeted had never seen nor heard of pyjamas until she saw mine when making my bed. They are nice\n\nnew, blue and white striped ones and quite attracted her admiration. When I came in from parade a few days ago she asked me what they were and did I wear them when I wanted to swank, or, as she put it, for \"beaucoup swank\". When I told her I slept in them she opened eyes and mouth in astonishment and exclaimed \"Oh! La la la! monsieur! jamais!\". That evening as I was getting to bed she called out to me to walk out into the kitchen in them to be admired by the whole family. So I was soon the centre of an admiring family including her daughter Celinde aged seventeen; and last nigh I was again called out to be admired in them by all the neighbours who had been specially invited for the display and I had to assure them that I really slept in them, one old girl telling the others it seemed so foolish to get dressed to go to bed.\n\nCelinde is quite a child of nature. Rosy cheeks, shiny dark eyes and white teeth, a beautiful healthy figure, glossy black hair, two lovely dimples and a beaming smile\nhide from view\n keep ones eyes\nfrom\n for some time from noticing her large hands made very rough\nand her feet\n by fieldwork. Her feet must also be affected by the muddy fields – standing in them all day long, but I have only seen them encased loosely in a pair of heavy military boots some soldier has given the family. She told me a few days ago that I must be very rich in Australia and called me \"Monsieur Beaucoup Swank\". I asked her why. \"You clean your teeth every day and always wash you hands and brush your hair\nbeforre\n when you come in to your meals\". \n\nThis was her idea of what rich people did; and when I told her all Australians did the same in Australia she\nreplied\n asked me incredulously \"All Australie beaucoup swank comme vous?\" Oui, Oui I replied but I am sure she doesn’t believe me.\n\nCelinde’s main work is pulling up and cutting the tops off the white beet they grow for winter fodder, consequently she is\nalways\n bending \nover the b\nlow down from morn till eve. I tried the job but half an hour of it gave me the backache. All the old women droop forward from the small of the back and are also very round shouldered.\n\nThe evening we arrived here I asked Madame to let me have her biggest tub and plenty of hot water to have a bath. She brought me a small basin of water, and it took a tremendous lot of explaining and illustrating to let her understand that I really wanted to get right into the tub and sit in it. I saw in the barn a big wooden cider tub and after getting her permission to wash it\n\nout and use it, my orderly and I half filled it and in I got. I had just got comfortably \nseeped\n in and was sitting up to my armpits in the water when Madame, out of her intense curiosity as to what I was doing, opened the bedroom door and popped her head around. When she saw my head and shoulders, all over soap, sticking out of the tub she clasped her hands and exclaimed in great\nsuprise\n astonishment \"Oh la, la! la, la! monsieur!\" and called out to her mother who also hobbled in to have a look at me. They afterwards told me they had never before seen any grown-up person in such a big bath. I felt glad Celinde was out working in the fields.\n\n&\n","217":"\n\nThis morning one of our motor lorries ran over and killed one of Madame’s fowls. She immediately picked up the dead bird, chopped its head off, plucked and cleaned it, and sold it to some diggers for 6 francs.\n\nAmong the 40 families living nearest this billet there is not one that takes a daily newspaper. I asked Madame out of curiosity to try to borrow me \"Le Matin\", Le Petit Parisien\" or any other daily newspaper, and she assured me that only about 10 houses in the town (of a population of about 1500) took a daily paper. Fancy such rusticity in Australia!\n\nThey won’t believe me that Australia is much bigger than from their place to Paris.\n\nTonight we had a route march by compass for 2 miles over rough ground and wearing our Box Respirators.\n","218":"\n\nA beautiful calm day; sun shining brightly.

The water was intensely cold.\n\nThe Bn. officers had a Dinner last night in a\ndes\n barn which \nwas deserted\nwas also used for our Pierrot Shows. Quite a good dinner, which it ought to have been as it cost us about 50 francs each.\n\n19th Sept.\n\nIn tent on very damp ground at Staples. We arrived near here by motor lorries yesterday and after a muddy walk reached these billets and tents. Every billet is crowded – our men being billeted in the stables and barn of this big farm. The farmer refused to take his calf out from where the men were to sleep, so they bundled it out; and when he tried to put it back again they bundled both him and the calf out. He was very annoyed but no one took any notice of him. This move from Lisbourg was\n\nvery sudden as we had been told we were there for our three months’ rest. \"Poor 4th Divvy’s come a gutzer again\" was a very common remark. The people of Lisbourg were really sorry to lose us as they had learned to love the Australians during our fortnight there.\n\nIt was a common sight to see the diggers making hay stacks, milking cows, mending gates and fences, or working in the fields with the whole French family. When we arrived at Lisbourg the people had their homes locked up and watched our coming to their village with great anxiety and even fear, but we were not there an hour before every door was open, \nand\nomelettes frying on every stove, and everybody beaming with smiles as they spoke to each other in Digger French. The tears they shed as we marched to the buses were dinkum.\n\n20th Sept.\n\nIn a tent shelter at Steenvoorde, West of Ypres. A terrific cannonading is going on \nwest\neast, north-\nwest\neast and south of us. The people here are Flemish and cannot understand French. In fact, although we are in France they understand, so they say, English better than French because so many of our common words sound much alike. They have swinish habits of eating and drinking, and not only look but are filthy in mind and body. Their two meals today consisted of potatoes partly mashed in olive oil, and the noise they made slopping it up with a big spoon as they leaned their head over their big bowls was sickening. The women are certainly coarse \"Flanders mares\". Very little meat is eaten either by the Flemish or French – most likely because it is so scarce and dear. Walnuts grow well here and are ripe now. We had plenty last night. Barcelona nuts were plentiful along the roads in the Lisbourg and Fruges areas. Raining heavily\n\nthis evening. It came through our tents last night and soaked our blankets. Every place about here is crowded with troops, and\neverything\n everywhere is muddy.\n\n22nd Sept.\n\nNear Belgian Chateau just west of Ypres. We left Steenvoorde area this morning and after a circuitous muddy march across fields, - circuitous perhaps to 1\/2 bluff the Flemish who watched us start off – we embussed and came to within a mile or so of Belgian Chateau, marching \nout\non to here after a late lunch. As we were resting after lunch a dead \"Tommy\" was carried past to a near-by cemetery. Quite spontaneously every Australian in the Brigade stood to attention until the carrying party turned out of sight. And most of us had seen hundreds of dead men. We are all camped under canvas sheets held up short stakes by strings; they average about 2 to 3 feet high and so are only to sleep under. Each\n\nsuch sleeping place is surrounded by bomb proof walls of sandbags as this is a notorious place for night bombing. Heavy bombardments north, east and south of us. Dozens of Observation Balloons are up around the Ypres Salient, and enemy artillery is active against them. His plane just came over and fired into the one nearest us, causing the two observers to jump out with their parachutes from over 2000 feet up.\n\nYarn told by old hands to new reinforcements. \"Last week two Fritz planes were 10000\nfeet\n yards up over Ypres when their engines stopped with the cold. Our guns would not let Fritz planes go to their help, and our ‘planes couldn’t get up that high, so the poor beggars died of starvation\".\n\nLeaving diary here in my valise.\n\nFrom scrapes of paper –\n\n23rd Sept. At China Wall, south of Ypres, having tea on our way into the line in Polygon Wood. Enemy shells are active about 300 yards south and north of us and our \"heavies\" are replying vigorously over our heads.\n\nOur packs have been left back at the Transport Lines near Belgian Chateau.\n\nI have often heard discussions as to whether shells can be seen going through the air. At present a great many of us can see quite plainly a continuous stream of howitzer shells just at\ntheir\nthe point of their highest trajectory. They come into sight\nrising\n at a tremendous height rising slowly, then slower and slower until the culminating point is reached, then the descent begins very slowly, then\nquicker\n less slowly and they are gone. We have been watching them, including several\nenemy\n from the enemy for the past half hour. Where they are lobbing we know not. The word has just come along to get ready to move up. There is\n\na heavy barrage near Hellfire Corner and Birr Cross Roads that we will have to go through unless it drops. There are many West Indian blacks working near here on our howitzer batteries. They seem to be wonderfully cool and\nactive\n willing workers. It\nwas\n is the last place I expected to find colored troops in as I have always heard they can’t stand the big guns, but here they are right in it. Our turn to move. Poor M---- who has never before been near the line seems frightened but is trying to smile and look unconcerned. The other new men look as if they were brought up among guns, shells, mud, duckboards, and barrages. It makes one feel proud to be an Australian.\n\n24th Sept. 5 pm.\n\nOh that hellish march in l\nIn Front Line Trench in Polygon Wood. Polygon Mound is just in front of us. That hellish march in last night will never\n\nbe forgotten by any of us. We got through the Hellfire Corner barrage luckily without casualties in our company although we were held up for some time by it. Then darkness came on – pitch black night among millions of shell holes all full of water that had quickly oozed into them from the water logged mud on all sides. We wind about in and out among them, up and down with stumblings and jerks and swearing. Gruesome figures lie about, in the water and half out of the mud, - Tommy and Scotty and Fritz in hundreds; broken wagons of all kinds, horses and mules, \nand\ntanks, and an aeroplane with its tail sticking up out of the black mud. There is not a star to guide us, nor tapes nor duckboards; only our wonderful magnificent runners. Touch has to be kept right throughout the battalion moving along in single file. The barrage on Westhoek\n\nRidge\nflops\n screams and flops down in the mud just as we reach it in the darkness. We have to go through it. Luckily the \"Jack Johnsons\" bury themselves deep in mud before bursting and give us showers of mud instead hurtling pieces of smashing iron. Touch is lost as each few rush ahead or back as each shell lobs but connection is soon made again. On these occasions men are guided more by the voices of their officers and N.C.O’s than by \nthe\nanything else for they can see nothing more than an\nshadowy form trudging immediately in front\n arm’s length away. Poor M---- whom I had noticed rather nervous the day before jumped into a shell hole as a five-nine screamed. It lobbed in the same hole at the same time. We near him were\ncovered\nsmothered with mud, lumps of which fell for the next half minute. Poor chap, he had been\n\ntrying for over two years to do his bit but sickness and natural weakness had kept him in camp after his mates had gone. And he never saw the line. We hurriedly looked for a trace of him, hoping to find some keepsake for his people in Australia, but knowing\nthat\n how utterly unlikely it was, and then on again. No trace will ever be seen of him in this world. \"Missing\"..\n\nAs we neared Battalion Headquarters (in a German Pillbox) we struck another barrage. Stretcher bearers were busy. Our cooks were carrying on just outside the pillbox. Then we were told to follow wide white tapes into the line. There are dozens of tapes going in all directions and crossing and recrossing each other. An officer halfway down the company loses touch with those in his front and for half an hour we are lost. We wind about and around shell holes holding on to each other’s entrenching-tool handle. At last a\n\nrunner meets us. If I meet a dinkum runner in Australia after the war I shall take off my hat to him. As soon as we\nare\n were at home in the trench, the \nretir\noutgoing company marched out. An officer from our Company and a man from each of our Lewis Gun teams had spent the previous day up here with the outgoing battalion.\n\nThis morning there was a heavy fog over the low ground in front of us. Lt Joe Westwood took out a small\npatrol\n fighting patrol and surprised and captured a German working party of ten. They were valuable for identification purposes – belonged to 49th Prussians. One \ncan\ncould hardly imagine their pleasure at being captured. When they reached us they were all smiles and delighted exclamations.\n\nDuring enemy shelling today little L---- sat in the bottom of the trench with his waterproof in his hand; every time a shell screeched near he buried his head in it. He is delicate and naturally of a nervous temperament, but refused a job in the Q.M. store in order that he might come in with us. A few days\n\nhere would make him a complete nervy wreck. In some armies he would perhaps be shot, but here everyone regards him with the kindliest sympathy and pretends not to notice his nervousness, and no one speaks\nto\n about it, except his officer to his Company Commander Capt. \"Humph\" Browning. The latter is sending him back to the Transport Lines to work on the water cart, or as part of the dump guard. The men are in splendid humour in spite of last night’s wearisome march in.\n\n25th – In Polygon Wood – 4 pm\n\nHeavily shelled at intervals during last night and today. \nOne shell got into a shell hole with one of our Lewis Gun crews of five men\nSeveral casualties. One of our own 18 pounder shells lobbed in our trench and decapitated Sgt. Meadows of Manly. He was one of the most efficient and cheery N.C.O’s in the Bn. and had been recommended for his commission.\n\nFortunately for a number of others with the Sergeant at the time the shell was a \"dud\". The Artillery people denied it could be one of \ntheir\nour shells, so we dug it out and sent for the F.O.O. who instantly recognised it. We want better shooting than this for the attack tomorrow morning.\n\nLast night we advanced a sap out into No Man’s Land for 150 yards so that we should have less to complete after the coming attack in order to reach the new front line,\nof tomorrow\n as it is our battalion’s job to link up\nthe\n tomorrow’s objective with this trench by a Communication Trench. Some might call this consummate Australian hide!\n\nWe brought down two rather inquisitive enemy planes with rifle and Lewis gun fire today. We gave them armor-piercing bullets. One toppled over about 300 yards in front of us and remained on its back; the other fell about 1000 yards in front. One man ran from the former and\n\ntwo from the latter towards the German lines. I claimed and was given the credit throughout my Company of bringing down these and another plane later. As at Eupaard I organised parties of rifles to fire 3, 4, 5 lengths in front and 3, 4, 5 etc above a plane.\n\nEntry","222":"\n\nLewis Guns cooperated with us in the fall of the second plane, but rifles alone were responsible for the first.\n\nOn the night of the 25th Sept, the enemy drove in our outpost\nand patrol\n from its position about 150 yards out in No Man’s Land. I was ordered to recapture and reconsolidate it. After an exciting scouting trip, and much dodging from shell-hole to shell-hole we bombed and rushed the place. We found the Germans had left; so after consolidating we advanced about 100 yards farther out to reconnoitre for we could hear the enemy working and talking. We found two dead Germans,\njust\n still warm, and one wounded. We brought in the packs and papers of the former and carried the latter himself in. They were from 49th Prussians.\n\n \n\n26th Sept. 3 am\n\nHave just come in off Patrol. Everything Jacques. The Intelligence Officers of the 4th Bde have just about completed laying out the tapes for lining up on shortly. They have been at it all night with covering parties out protecting them. The 14th, 15th and 16th Bns are getting ready behind us to come up onto these tapes. Our Intelligence Officer, Lt. Harry Davis, is very keen. It is rather a difficult job finding tapes in the dark as there are no landmarks to go by. Everywhere there are just trenches,\nand\n shellholes and scraps of barbed wire. Prismatic compasses are rather difficult to work with too on account of so many things affecting them – even the steel helmets having an influence. We have held this front line for three nights. Our casualties have been moderate considering where we are, but there ought to be something doing within a few hours now. The 16th Bn. (Westralians) are going through us first to take the first line about 800 yards ahead, and the 14th (Victorian);\nand\n the 15th (Queenslanders & South Australians) are\n\nto leapfrog them and take the final objective about 1200 yards out and we are to dig the Communication Trench out to them and keep supplies up to them.\n\nHave just received three letters from Australia from J. A runner brought them up.\n\n4 am\n\nThey are beginning to get on to the tapes – great silent shadowy masses of them. Our patrols just in report nothing suspicious from the enemy. The artillery on both sides is normal and enemy flares less active than generally.\n\nEntry 28th Sept. Midday on Westhock Ridge.\n\nWe are a weary lot sitting in the sun trying to dry the mud off our clothes. Many are almost naked \"chatting\" themselves and their clothes. The march out last night was even more wearisome than the march in. It seemed almost interminable as we plodded along round sheets of water formed by shell-holes meeting shell-holes. Quite mechanically we let our legs stumble on, our weariness preventing us from noticing or considering anything. At length we reached here and threw ourselves down anywhere and anyhow to sleep.\n\nThe limbers can come up here now as since our capture of\n\nPolygon Wood, a corduroy road has been constructed across the mud. As soon as I got out of our little dugout about an hour ago I saw a sight that could only be seen in an Australian Army. There was the \"Brig\" (Gen. Brand) surrounded by a hundred diggers all grabbing towards him. He told them not to push so much but as he kept on handing out tins of salmon and sausages, preserved fruits, bottles of sauce, packets of biscuits,\nand\n jars of lollies, bars of chocolate, and an occasional bottle of port wine, what could he expect? I saw one man leaving the crowd with a pack containing two tins of pineapple, two tins of other fruit, a tin of Cambridge Sausages, two bottles of tomato sauce (Australian too), three bottles of port wine and fully a dozen packets of biscuits as well as\nboth\n acid drops and chocolates. He had a mate right close up to the \"Brig\"\nand\n who had passed his \"issues\" out. Another digger\nand getting\n got away with a case of Australian port wine – a dozen bottles. A third digger got a\ncase\n\nsecond case on to his shoulder, but, putting it up so high, the Brig. saw him and called out to leave it alone as it was for the officers who had been in the line. Hearing this and being the only officer handy I stood up and approached the crowd. The \"Brig\" saw me and called out \"Here, W----, come and\nkeep\n give a hand here\"\nWe then\n. There he was in his old sheep skin jerkin, surrounded by a stack of cases, empty, half empty or full. One of his canteen men was opening them with a bayonet while he himself was handing them out. \"Here leave those cases alone, they’re for the 16th Battalion!\" he called out to some 13th diggers who wanted to assist his canteen man. The distribution\nnow\n again proceeded after he had instructed me to pick out a few men from each company to receive for the others. However some diggers are going to have a blow out. I received six bottles of port wine for the officers – about 30 of us.\n\nAm going to have lunch and some port wine now.\n\nEntry 28th Sept. 5 pm.\n\nAt daybreak\nJust before daybreak on the 26th our wonderful barrage came down. The barrage we had at Euendecourt had been \"good enough to shave yourself by\", as I heard a digger put it, \nbut\nand this one was just as accurate but a hundred times more tremendous. It cut a clean line just ahead of us. Those who have not seen and heard a barrage like this can never imagine it. The turmoil of even the elements would be minute when compared with the belching of thousands upon thousands of big guns supported by a continuous hail from thousands of machine guns. The whizzing over our heads was like\nthat\n the hissing of millions of serpents, and then the bursting of thousands of shells just in front. We watched it in amazement, it was so much heavier and better than we had expected, ducking our heads whenever a shell passed low. Any such ducking would have been too late.\nThis wanted\n (I think our C.S.M. \"Curly\" Harper \nwas\nis about the only man I have never seen duck). This went on for a few minutes. Then \"Get Ready 16th!\"\n\nwas heard, and the Westralians lined up just behind where our shells were churning the ground. It was grand. Almost every man lighted a cigarette quite coolly – although many had never been under a barrage before, and few under one of such weight. I saw some I knew to be in action for the first time and but for knowing them one would never have dreamt they were not veterans. What wonderful faith they had in the gunners behind and in the shells themselves. The few minutes passed slowly. The 14th and 15th who were supposed to be 200 yards behind the 16th were anxious and had come close up. \"We won’t wait for the barrage, we’ll show it the blanky way\" I heard from a 14th man. \"What the hell are you in a hurry for?\" replied an older soldier, \"we’ll get enough before we’ve finished\". \"Oh go and get your face camouflaged!\" was the retort courteous. Then the swish lifted the line of dusty churned ground and hurtling lead and iron crept\n\nslowly forward never \nmore\na square foot of ground being missed. The advance was at the rate of 25 yards a minute, which seemed altogether too slow. \"Come on 16th\", some officers called out. \"Here, help me over your trench thirteenth!\" said one after another as they hurried to take their places. And the whole line moved forward close behind the barrage. We watched them mingle with the smoke and dust,(am going to issue the rum\n) then the line of the 14th and 15th went over us. Soon they too were lost to sight. Then the wounded began to trickle back, first walking cases, then stretcher cases. And as the smoke cleared away many who had been dinkum diggers a few minutes before were seen lying out ahead of us in their last resting place. Then a batch of bewildered but pleased prisoners came back without any escort. We rounded them up into stretcher parties and made them carry back our wounded, which work they cheerfully did.\n\nA\nGerman\n Prussian Major and his orderly were the next. He looked ill pleased with everything and bore himself very Prussian-like. \"You must not take my orderly for a stretcher-bearer\" he said to me in perfect English. \"You’re very lucky to be taken yourself\" I replied as I searched him. He had a small box of cigars in his pocket. He took one out as I handed them back to him, and put it in his mouth. I struck a match and held it up while he puffed. I expected him to act the gentleman and offer me one especially as I could have had the lot, but he insolently slammed the box\nclosed\n lid and put it back in his pocket. I felt annoyed but recollected that he was what he was, and kept cool, telling him to go back the way\nthe\n his men were going, and detailing a man to\nfollow and\n escort him and keep him away from\nhis men\n them. Judge my astonishment when he calmly looked at the man I had detailed, and said \"I demand an escort of equal rank!\" We didn’t have a Major with us, but it would have been all the same had we. Capt. Browning, hearing his request picked up a shovel in a threatening way\n\nseeing which, and feeling perhaps that a knock with such a weapon would be unbecoming to his high and mighty self, he strutted across the trench and back with our smallest digger escorting him with rifle and bayonet. A short distance away one of his own shells caught him almost directly and blew him to pieces.\n\nThe smoke and dust clearing somewhat we saw the 16th on their captured line consolidating, and higher up on the slope of the ridge the 14th and 15th also in position & consolidating. One batch of about 200 prisoners now passed back, also a few here and there. We got 500 on our Brigade front. Soon every possible man of the","223":" was out carrying bombs, water, ammunition,\nand\n wire and stakes to the captured positions, \nor\nbringing in the wounded or digging the Communication Trench, - or souveniring. Then a shell lobbed in our left outpost and killed two and wounded three of a Lewis Gun crew there. Then their barrage came on us and over us making running and stretcher-bearing\n\neven more risky. Capt \"Bert\" Jacka V.C. who\nis\n was in charge of the","224":" in their new line seemed to be everywhere and to have a charmed life, for we could see him walking about among the Victorians who were digging in.\n\nWith their barrage an enemy ‘plane came over low down to see what we were doing. We brought it down with rifles and Lewis Guns and it fell near the Butte of Polygon. This Butte or Mound of Polygon is reported to be an ancient burial place. It must be of great age for large trees are growing out of its sloping sides and top, at least I should say \"were growing\" for the whole of Polygon Wood is nothing but a mass of splintered butts – splintered and splintered again by our shells.\n\nI am in charge of a party of 250 men tonight to","225":"\n bury a cable forward to Anzac House, - about a thousand yards of digging. We commence at 8, and after completing the job of burying it six feet deep\n\nwe return here and march out back to the Transport Lines at Belgian Chateau.\n","226":"\n\nIn huts at Ouderdom. About a dozen Bosche ‘planes are over us bombing. Each bomb fairly shakes the ground for miles and the huts threaten collapse. While I have been writing the above two lines 14 bombs at least have burst quite close to us.\n","227":"\n\nWas awakened at 4 this morning and detailed to take a party of 50 men back to Ypres to work for a few weeks. Took quite a long time to find the Signallers to whom we had to report. Went through Ypres & Kruisstraat looking for them and at last found them under Belgian Chateau. Here they have a big telephone and telegraph exchange, being in quick connection with the whole of the British Front and even with the War Office, London. My work is to repair cables to the forward Battalion Headquarters, as often as they are broken by shells, and to keep them buried at least 6 ft deep. Likely to be kept busy at this nasty game as I shall be looking after practically all the cables forward from Ypres towards the East and South.\n","228":"\n\nIn a 6 x 3 tent, 3 feet high and sandbagged around, near Belgian Chateau. My 50 men are all in similar places two in a tent. Instead of sandbagging themselves in, some have sunk themselves down into the ground about 3 feet. These precautions are taken because we are bombed every night for hours by enemy ‘planes; and no single bomb can get more than a few of us. Have just inspected the men’s feet,\nand\n seen them\nrubbed\n washed with hot Condy’s solution, and powdered with talc powder, and then issued the rum to them in their homes. This is a nightly job here.\nIn the line\n In or near the line the examination of each man’s feet by an officer is a daily job. Our brigade is very strict on it, consequently we have no trench feet.\n\nThis morning I took 30 men through Ypres in a lorry to near Birr Cross Roads. We then walked to Westhoek and banked up a cable from here back to near Lille Gate. Many heavy shells came over us, scattering dumps in every direction, but luckily we had no casualties. In one old trench we found 500 tins of Bully-beef in tip top condition; so we won’t be short of rations for a while. My party is attached to the","229":" Australian Pioneers\n\nfor rations. They are clearing up the area West and South of Ypres. They treat us very well with rations and rum, and also allow us the use of their hot showers.\n\nThis morning we counted\nabout\n twenty tanks wrecked within a small area and all gradually sinking into the mud. They can never be moved unless after being blown to pieces. I entered and examined one in a crater 40 feet deep and about 60 ft across. It had evidently been mined. My party all got souvenirs from it.\n\nNo one who has seen Ypres can ever imagine the wreckage of beautiful buildings there. It is the worst I have seen for a large town. Smaller towns on the Somme, and near\nMessines\n where Messines used to be, have been utterly obliterated except for a brick or two, and Albert is a large town in heart-breaking ruins, but for a city like Ypres, it is terrible. The Bosche ‘plane alarm is sounding – three sharp whistle blasts – all lights out. I am writing in the dark. The ground is trembling violently with the bursting of his bombs. They seem right overhead. That\n\none must be in the Mule lines near us. A nose-cap from one of our \"Archies\" has just lobbed among the men. They\nall\n have called out in reply to my question that there is no damage; they take it as a joke. Who would be anywhere else when they could be with men like these.\n\nLater – 10 pm. Planes gone. 40 mules killed within 150 yards of us. Three bombs got right into them. Stretcher-bearer B---- has just asked me if I can spare him another nip of rum. His luck was in. Raining heavily and tent leaking.\n","230":"\n\nHad an easy day all round, had my breakfast and lunch in bed. My batman takes quite a motherly interest in me, and as I was off color, he isisted on my staying in bed, and brought me my breakfast and lunch. Breakfast consisted of bully-beef, pickles and slice of Australian cake he received yesterday. No bread issue last night. My lunch was like my breakfast with the addition of bread and honey.\n\nRaining. Everything is mud, mud, mud!\n","231":"\n\nMidday – Raining heavily on and off since early last night. A light railway train – a Decauville – is puffing past my little tent. Wonderful what loads these two feet lines carry. This engine – only about 8 feet long and 5 feet high, with a boiler I can cock my leg over – is now pushing over 150 tons on munitions, and there are hundreds of these little steam engines, as well as still smaller motor ones, always going within a few miles of here. There are light lines everywhere, in some places right up to the howitzers. Our politicians in Australia will be missing a splendid opportunity if they don’t get in early and buy a few of these light railway systems.\nfor\n They would open up the country for the heavier lines later on – like they do here. I don’t think anything could be better than these lines from Cobar to C.S.A. mines and Gundabooka, from Canbelego to Nymagee, Carrathool or Griffith to Hillston, Moama to Moulamein, Swanhill to Balranald. There are hundreds of places in Australia where they would make good payable feeders to our main lines. For passenger travelling also they would certainly be surer and more comfortable than\n\nour outback coaches.\n\nThere are immense military stores everywhere one goes. It is no wonder dumps are now and again blown up.\n\nYesterday morning four of our Australian divisions made another very successful push. They caught the Germans just ready to attack us lined up on their tapes – 1500 of them – at daybreak, when our terrible barrage came down. Not one escaped – 900 were killed and 600 captured – so I have had it reported to me by an officer of the 23rd Bn. who was there. Heavy guns are constantly firing somewhere or other, the nearer reports sharp and incisive, those far away like the tumbling about and rolling of big corrugated iron water tanks. A roll, another longer roll, a bump or two, a heavier bump, a roll and all over again. I think of several big tanks or wagons being hauled over a badly-made corduroy road. This is always going on up here. Some of the guns over 10 miles away shake the sandbag walls of my tent, while the naval 10-inch gun, about 400 yards away shakes the earth here quite violently.\n\nSix of my men are filling in shell holes where Fritz has got on to our cable route, out East of Ypres.\n","232":" 9.30 pm\n\nPlanes have just been bombing us again. Several Tommies, I hear, have been killed. Have just finished the feet, and rum issue. We have had an easy day so the men have written about four letters each on average. Have been busy censoring them for three hours.\nI forget\n I just glance through them for military information and seldom remember anything of them after I have finished. I remember one man describing our artillery as \"gorgeous\", and his shaky writing as \"caused by the perpetual violent quakings of Mother Earth\", but who he was I know not. Another man writing to a friend married a year or two ago, asked \"Is the paling fence the only thing you still have running around your house?\".\n\nReceived a big mail this morning for the company and five for myself from wife. Wrote my 6th letter for this week to wife. Took six men over to Kruisstradt Farm to act as runners. Very muddy and slushy everywhere. Read the Bulletin (Australian) of 7th June.

We were bogged again and again.\n\nHave wired for extra dry socks, singlets, and boots for my party. We are always deep in mud from the moment we step out of our tents. Still we carry on while \"skunks\" at home stab us in the back by striking against the Government while we are over here. I can understand people striking against private employers or companies, or against a Government that does not represent the majority – all power to them – but against a Government where they have Universal Suffrage – and the widest suffrage in the world at that, and at this time!! I am sure they cannot possibly appreciate the position. I am a Unionist, and one of the founders of a union, and most of my men here are solid unionists, but they unanimously express disgust against those at home striking against the Government. Several of my men have dysentery – rather a rotten thing this rainy weather with our conveniences open to the sky. We were bombed heavily last night, several Tommies and horses killed near here.\n","234":"\n\nIn 6x4x3 tent near Belgian Chateau near Ypres. Very wet miserable day and the ground is frightfully sloppy. Working in mud – digging down into it for 7 and 8 feet burying cables – all the morning. All thoroughly saturated. Every one has just washed his feet in hot Condys’ solution,\nand\n powdered them, changed socks, and had rum ration. So\nthere are\n we have had several songs\ngoing on\n – \"Mother Machree\", \"We Are the Ragtime Army!\", \"The Bonny Banks of Loch Lomond\", \"The Fourth Brigade are Happy!\", \"Yaka Hula\", \"What’ll We Do With the Kaiser?\" and some ragtime. One tent starts and the others join in.\n\nThis afternoon I visited Ypres and saw Lieuts Nugent and D’Arcy Irvine near Lille Gate. They have 100 men camped up there making a water pipe line from Lake Zillebeke to Hooge – a nasty job at which they have had heavy casualties. Had a pleasant afternoon tea with them in a cellar, and invited them to tea with me tomorrow evening. I arranged with the 1st Pioneers to allow their men as well as my own to have a hot shower bath tomorrow afternoon. Got wet through again coming home from Ypres but it didn’t make much difference. Am going to read\n\nBulletin of 12th Jly before going to sleep. Met Sid Lloyd of Deniliquin in Ypres.\n","235":"\n\nStill raining. Same kind of muddy work this morning. Hot showers this afternoon.

We are camped in tents between Caestre and Flêtre. The tents have been erected on wet ground, so everything is very damp.\n\nHellfire Corner – Nobody knows who christened it this name but everyone knows why. There could be no other name. It lies at the intersection of some roads between Ypres and Westhoek. There is no metal left there now as it has all been turned \nover\nup and over, and up and over again and mixed with the mud and slush. The roads now consist of thousands upon thousands of long wide planks of timber forming corduroys over shell holes, dead men, mules, and horses, broken guns, ambulances, limbers and wagons. They run through this littered desolation. Everywhere nearby are evidences of terrific bombardments, there being not even a square foot that has not been torn by shells or bombs. Even the new corduroy roads have been hurled in fragments into the air, but the stolid, solid Tommy pioneers keep the holes filled up and planked over where possible, or if the hole is too\n\nbig they lead the track around it, using the splintered planks, limbers, wagons, and guns for a foundation. There were once cosy brick buildings here, but even the broken bricks and foundations have disappeared. There is nothing left now to show the former inhabitants where their homes were, for even the landscape has been torn about. Where children happily gathered the daily eggs, mademoiselle milked her cows, pigs grunted and squeaked, mother made the soup and omelettes, grandma her Belgian lace, and father smoked his Flemish pipe, and wooden clogs pattered along the \nstone floors\nbrick paths, there is now nothing but churned ground and war debris. Trees that once grew around these homes have long ago been uprooted, and all traces of them buried beneath the corduroy tracks. Fifty feet down a brigadier has his headquarters and corps signallers their exchange. Water constantly\n\ndrips on them as they sit, lie or splash about, and but for shifts of thirty men constantly pumping they would soon be flooded out.\n\nAnd Birr X Roads is the same as Hellfire Corner, only hotter.\n\nWhite war diary,","237":" –","238":"\n\nMLMSS 965\n\nPart 2\n","239":"\n\nIn camp, in tent, at Caestre at 4th Aust Div.

Being Sunday they had thought that we might come over and so had some special cooking done for us. \nMy\n One old madame, aged 80, had a pullet, French beer, homemade bread and butter for us and insisted on our overeating, and then filled our pockets with apples and walnuts which grow well here. My old madame had cooked one of her caged rabbits, which she could have sold for 8\/- and made us sit down and eat two helpings of it stewed, as well as some homemade bread, butter & jam.\n\nThen more coffee. then we went to where Merifield has been billeted and they also had something ready for us and wanted to feed us up – imagine what they must think Australians are as far as eating is concerned – but we only drank a few cups of coffee and brought a couple of pears each away with us.\n\nWhile we were there we gave them cigarettes and sweets to send to their sons at the war, or in Germany as prisoners. It is very pleasing to receive such a welcome from people who are obliged to billet us. We were the first Australians in the district and the people almost idolise us. This is no exaggeration either. My old madame here \ntells\n says that we are the best-mannered soldiers, and the most generous and thoughtful she has ever known, far more so than the French soldiers themselves. She is just out under my window now feeding the pigs – twenty of them They are as troublesome as troublesome fowls can sometimes be in Australia running inside if they see anything to pick up. They have even been under my bed after some cake I have. \nIt is now only\n\n4.30 but I have a candle to write by\n. I have just \n sometimes\n written home. I wonder how my letters read in Australia, as I write them just as my thoughts ramble on. Sometimes I get \"fed up\" with continual soldering, and I am \nsure\n afraid my letters show it. when we get cheerful periods – all soldiers seem like think judging by what I censor. On the whole, when one thinks of the various phases of one’s \nlife\n mind it is amusing. for example, I feel love with the old French people here sometimes for their kindness; then the old man spits all over the floor, the little boy makes water behind the door near where I sit, madame, who, by the way, has only one brown tooth, cuts a fowl’s neck with a pair of scissors, and the little granddaughter does her – in the corner, and we feel fed up with them, and want, even more than ever, to be back in some refined place again. But it’s all in a lifetime, and we all make ourselves at home as much as possible. My birthday today.\n","255":" – 4 pm. Too dark to write without a candle. A very dull day. 40 men were evacuated this week with skin troubles such as scabies and itch. The gassed men have not yet got their voices back, and on all sides men are whispering and coughing. Col. Durrant arrived during the week and took charge of the Bn. Col. Marks went to Italy and South France. Have had plenty revolver practice lately. Football matches every day. Bought for \"C\" Company enough straw for sleeping on, but some getting muddy I tried to get more but was unsuccessful as there was none beaten. The farmers are all covering their beet for winter fodder. We have a comfortable and well managed Bn. Mess in a large chateau for which we pay a big rent. Major H Murray V.C. D.S.O, D.C.M. is President and Lt John East Secretary. Gn Birdwood visited \nBrigade today\n the Division today. Several French soldiers here on leave have asked me about their prospects in Australia as immigrants. I gave them an Australian Geography lesson and told them how to get in touch with our High Commissioner. A French schoolmaster spent this \nafternoon\n evening with me. He has funny sides about Australia, picturing us as having \"beaucoup de negres, beaucoup des grands serpents\n\nand beaucoup de crocodiles, and Kangaroos, also nearly all desert very sparsely inhabited by white people. He was surprised that we all spoke English. Portuguese are billeted in this town and he expressed, as emphatically as an expressive Frenchman can, the utmost contempt for them, describing them as filthy and lazy, and a decided disadvantage as allies, as they ate good food, occupied billets, and yet did nothing to win the war.\n\nThe rabbits I see in France in cages are about two or three times the size of ours & their furs seem of much finer quality. As we have the pest in Australia, why not have a decent pest, as I believe we could easily get, by letting loose in our bush some good stud rabbits from here.\n\nEntry","256":" – In PARIS with Lieut Joe Westwood. We received permission at midnight on","257":" to visit Pais, caught train at Anvin for St Pol on","258":" and there to Amien. Here we changed for Paris. We were accompanied throughout our train journey by Officers of Indian Calvary who spoke excellent English.\n\nArrived Paris – Gare du Nord – at 9 pm,. took tube to Republique Station dined well at British army & Navy Club and then booked up at Hotel Moderne on La Place de la Republique. We then went for a long walk through several streets, but rain coming on sent us home.\n\nThis morning we tried unsuccessfully to get a bath. Although we ordered it for 8, it wasn’t ready by 10. We had a cold cup of coffee & a small piece of bread & butter for 2 francs each and a tip. I asked the chambermaid for a newspaper. She sent a boy who also had to be tipped. We had no soap, and asked for a little to be placed on the washstand. Chambermaid made a big fuss and sent waiter with a small cake of common soap worth about 1 ½ d in Sydney for which he demanded \"un sheelang\" (1\/-), also a tip.\n\nMENU\n\nDejeuner a les 4.50\n\nTsors d’oeuvre varie’s\n\nSaucisses au Rissotto\n\nCotes de veau braisees au jus\n\nPommes Mair\n\nFromages\n\nFruits\n\nHOTEL MODERNE\n\nPARIS\n\nServis a l’\n\nNo. 439\n\nHOTELE MODERNE\n","259":" Place de la Republique\n\nPARIS\n\n530 Chambres et Salons\n\nMr White \n\n12 11 Appartement 11-\n\nAt last we got away from the hotel and walked through several main streets and Les Halles or Markets. The streets and boulevards are magnificent – beautifully clean & well sky-lined architecturally. We visited Palais Royal, Bourse, reported to A.P.M. on Place du Marche de St Honore.Then we walked to Tuileries Gardens. Everywhere we were asked for collections for wounded prisoners of war, orphans and other purposes. Many Americans are in Paris – a fine class of men too. We have repeatedly been called Americans by the Parisians. The Place de la Concorde is a beautiful Square with groups of statuary representing the Departments of France. Those of Alsace Lorriane were draped and covered with wreaths. Our next walk was along Champs Elysees and over the Bridge of Alexander III to Les Invalides. Here there are a War Museum, a picture gallery of war pictures and above all the Tomb of Napolean. There are collections of Aeroplanes, captured guns, mortars etc, the aeroplanes of Guynemer, the famous French \n\naviator. We all took off our hats to the Tomb of Napolean. After afternoon tea we taxied through the Champs Elysees visitng Etoille and the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nEntry","260":" – Paris – Yesterday 10th we visited Hotel de Ville, Eglise St Jacques, Notre Dame, Palais de Justice. The interior of the Hotel de Ville \nwas\n is extremely magnificent, the walls of the three halls, and their roof, being covered with valuable paintings of industries, professions and allegories. Notre Dame was rather disappointing after the Cathedrals of Amien & Rouen. In the evening we went to a Cinema. This morning we slept in and lunched at the Hotel Madame. I wrote to J. & prepared postcards for the post. This afternoon we visited Bastille, Boulevarde Germain, Chambre des Deputes, Eiffel Tower, Great Wheel (on which we went). Returning we went through Commerce, a very busy shopping suburb. Here I bought a few article for my little Billie – at tube \"(Metro)\" – bought\n\nto Madeline near Rue Royale in which is the famous Maximes Café – a small insignificant looking place – where we had a couple of Manhattans with another Australian Officer we met there. After Maximes we walked Boulevarde de Capucines and continued right along this street to Republique. After dinner we had an interesting conversation with a Miss O’Connor, an Australian artiste, who has lived here in Paris many years, and a Madame Rieu, whose husband, an Englishman was killed two months ago in the Foreign Legion of France.\n\nEntry","261":" – (In Restaurant at Anvin, near St Pol, Pas de Calais) Just arrived here from Paris. Left Paris this morning at 9, passed through Amiens to Abbeville. Here we caught a goods train to St Pol, as the French passenger train would not get us to St Pol before 11 pm. As it was we arrived there at 5.30 pm. then after visiting the Officers; Club for refreshments and a wash we walked along the road and picked up a Motor Transport to Anvin where we are now awaiting dinner (7.40 pm) before walking\n\n6 or 7 kilometres to our billets at Fontaine des-Boulous. Yesterday","262":" Westwood & myself visited Boulevarde de Michel, Cluny ruins, Latin Quarter, Pantheon (exterior) l’Eglise de St Genevioeve, Jardin des Plantes (including a poor Zoo) taxied to Jardin de Luxembourg, spent a pleasant hour there, then taxied through Champs Elysees past Etoille and Arc de Triomphe, through l’Avenue de Grande Aimee to Pont de Neuilly, and back to Arc de Triomphe. This wonderful arch we examined with the greatest interest. It is inscribed with the names of all Napolean’s generals in each of his wars, and all his victories, among which I noticed YPRES, the scene of so much in this war. Walked from Arc de Triomphe through Champs Elysees and Place de la Concorde (How Paris is a city of open spaces!) to the Madeleine, a beautiful church, with an exquisite interior, lavishly adorned with white sculpturings.\n\nFrom the Madeleine a short walk brought us to the Restaurant de l’Opera, where for 7 francs each we had an excellent dinner. After a visit by Tube to the Gare de Nord we promenaded from Opera to Republique visting a cinema on the way.\n","263":" At Ruisseauville in a comfortable bed writing. With 5 Signallers on bikes I left ahead of the Bn. as Billiting officer. Our lines are the usual heavy military push ones. The road was muddy. On the road one signaller became sick and I left him with the","264":" Bn at Crepy. We then had two broken bikes and so walked 4 miles in the dark. At Canlers while the men were mending their bikes in the Estaminet I went to a private house for tea, and received a most cordial reception. Some Australian mounted troop officers had been billeted there over a year before and had left an excellent name behind them. There were some \"Tommy\" officers there and they told me to expect a warm welcome from the family as they (the family) were always telling them how much they loved the Australians. When I entered the dining rooms \"Oh un Australien! un Australien!\" was repeated several times quite joyously. I was received enthusiastically indeed. Madame Deloziere (Address Canlers-par Fruges, Pas de Calais) cooked me eggs, gave me plenty of bread, butter\n\njam and coffee, for which she would take nothing. Leaving them, after eating so well Madame and her two daughters embraced and kissed me quite affectionately. Needless to say I reciprocated. Then again meeting my signallers we trudged to Ruisseauville in the dark – and mud. Arriving here we all were soon comfortably installed.\n","265":" Up early this morning finding and allotting billets for the Bn. which arrived early this afternoon. Found comparatively good billets for the troops and a bed for every officer except two. Had a remarkably appetising dinner at 2 pm. Veal cutlets and chipped potatoes, tender and beautifully cooked by Madame. Cycled through the village of Azincourt and on to the famous field of the Battle of 1415 where there is still, in a clump of trees, the soldiers cemetery, in which stands a monument surmounted by a high crucifix, the whole surrounded by a hedge. The monument is in memory of the French and\n\nEnglish who fell on that famous day. \n\nLeaving Ruisseauville I cycled with my billeting party towards Wambercourt, but darkness came on quickly about 4.30 – and we had to walk the last 3 miles. I called at a house attached to a flour mill worked by a very large water wheel, found a bed and billets for my signallers and a good supper for all. Some officers of \nan Australian\nthe 51st battalion, billeted near, came across later on and we gave the miller and his family a concert which they appeared to enjoy thoroughly. The mill wheel acted as accompaniment, for it was turning all the time, the old miller in his flour covered cap and clothes going out every now and again to attend to it.\n","266":" Had great difficulty this morning in arranging sufficient billets. After seeing all in as comfortably as possible – albeit very much scattered – I cycled back to \nthe Mill\n an ancient Feudal Castle near the mill. It was intensely interesting\n\nalthough in ruins and a good deal overgrown with blackberries. It was battered and destroyed by Henry V of England about the time of Agincourt, and some of the holes made by his cannon balls, according to the residents, are still to be seen, although it was afterwards partly rebuilt, and formed into a stronghold for the tycourt Count of Criquy, who plundered the district, including the eminent church of Fressin nearby. This church was ancient when the Spaniards from the Netherlands conquered this district and it contains many relics of the Spanish occupation. I am told that the Spaniards once occupied North France as far as Etaples. I had previously noticed several Spanish-looking people in these parts, and have noticed more since.\n\n19th. Being very tired I remained in bed until 9.45. Last night three of us yarned with the old man, his two daughters and the little girl of the elder whose husband has been\n\nprisoner in Germany two years. The old man was sorting out and tying up his tobacco leaves which grow plentifully about here. Very fine timber and apple country. Leaving Wambercourt we again cycled, passing through \nAb\n Aubin-san-Vant with its many big mill wheels. How these people use their rivers. An Australian river outback could be used, I imagine, in the same way, if locked and controlled properly. Walked two miles up a steep hill and then had an exciting ride down a winding road almost into Tortefontaine where we arrived just before dark and succeeded in arranging billets for three companies and Headquarters. The people at this house where I am billeted for the night are quite interested in my fountain pen, having never seen one before – Imagine it and in France!. They are still watching me writing. When I sat down with paper in front of me, Madame put a bottle of ink on the table. I didn’t notice at the time\n\nand went on writing. After a few minutes she came over and took the cork our of the bottle, but still I went on writing. This evidently astonished her for she called out to her mother who was in the next room putting the baby to sleep. when the latter arrived there was great excitement & madame explained that I had been writing 20 minutes without dipping in the ink. Grandma suggested that I had a pencil and not a pen. Although I could hardly believe my ears, I now took notice as I went on writing. Using my blotting paper convinced Grandma that I was really writing with ink. She exclaimed Oh La,la! la,la! monsieur qu’est ce que c’est cette plume que vous avez la? ‘C’est une porte-plume, madame!\" I replied \"Comment?\" monsieur! she asked indirectly. \"Une porte-plume madame, elle porte son encre!\" This astonished them and madame called out ‘Jacques!\" to her husband who was\n\nworking in another room. They told him to watch me write without dipping in the ink and that I had already been writing for over half-an-hour. He was not as experienced in his surprise as the women folk but nevertheless he asked \"Comment, monsieur?\" I then took the pen to pieces and gave them an object lesson on it. They were delighted when I let them use it a little. \"Une porte-plume! muttered Grandma, \"Une porte-plume Oh, la, la!\" and she sat down near the stove shaking her head at the wonderful things that had come to pass. I know that when I write home and tell this in Australia, my people will think I am stretching it somewhat but nevertheless it is quite a fact, and in a village of about 1000 population.\n","267":" – After seeing the Bn into billets at Tortefontaine I had dinner prepared for the officers of two companies at an estaminet, and for those of another company at\n\nthe school by the schoolmaster’s wife. She gave us an omelette for five consisting of 20 eggs, pork cutlets, mashed potatoes – beautifully browned, - pears and apples, cider and coffee for 3 ½ francs each. Easily seen Australians had not been here before. We enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nLeaving \nthe Tortefontaine\n the Bn. behind at Tortefontaine we cycled through the ancient Dompierre to Crecy. Here we examined the town, saw the monument erected to the memory of the French soldiers who fell at Crecy in \n14\n 1346, visited the battlefield, walked over it and stood on the hill on which stood the famous windmill from which Edward III of England watched the battle, and saw his son the Black Prince win his spurs. the windmill itself stood here until ------ the year of the Fashoda Incident when an ultra-patriotic Frenchman angry with\n\nEngland cit it down. The mound itself is still there.\n\nArrived at Fontaine-sur-Maye in time to have dinner with three officers of the 51st. Bn. which Bn. was marching a day ahead of the","268":"\n\n21st – Had a very difficult job billeting the officers but found excellent billets for the men. After seeing the Bn. in, I lunched with \"C\" Coy, and then started again for Hautvillers. the Bn’s next destination. Here I found it most difficult to obtain \neven\n decent billets for anyone, let alone a Bn, as Hautvillers is but a small farming village. It will be necessary for everybody to be crushed and the Bn. scattered. Everywhere is frightfully muddy and slushy. The marching in full packs will be tiresome, - and then vile billets at the end of it. I asked the Marie to try and find me better ones but he simply shrugged his shoulders & said \"C’est las guerre, monsieur!\"\n\nRiding here today I again visited Crecy battlefield and\n\ntown. Three French children took me over the field and showed me all they could – and they were quite good guides. They told me that the English won. I examined the monument erected to the memory of the blind king of Bohemia, the then ally of France, who was killed on the same spot, the date on the monument being","269":" There was where his hat and \"Ich Dien\" plumes were picked up and over there was where the Black Prince got into difficulties. So the children told me. This field so soon after Azincourt! imagine my feelings as I walked over it. Then in Crecy itself, I visited the second monument, erected to this King and his companions, also a Spanish monument, for they were here in the 16th century. Crecy church is wonderfully beautiful, especially in its stained glass windows. Chinese were working for the Army in the Forest of Crecy – a heavily timbered and extensive forest. Very fine apple country, with cider vats and presses at every farm.\n","270":" – As soon as the Bn had settled down this morning at Hautvillers, the farmer in whose stables the majority were billeted came excitedly to me and asked for a Guard to be put on to watch about 15 tons of apples he had in heaps about his orchard. I placed a guard of 10 men. Shortly afterwards he came calling after me again most excitedly and asked me to take the guard away as they were eating more apples than the rest of the Bn. had. I went to \"C\" & \"D\" Coy. officers’ billet and found them all eating apples taken from another big heap just under the window, Afraid that the farmer would see the cores, or smell the apples, they got me to buy 5 francs worth as a bluff by which to get through about 20 francs worth. The farmer was very wealthy and was charging 7d for eggs.\n\nOn the road \ntoday\n here to Franleu today I passed through Abbeville where I spent an hour and had afternoon tea. I am billeted here with the Marie. In my attic room\n\nare hundreds of large pears and apples. I have already eaten several and intend to proceed further when I finish writing.\n","271":" – At Woincourt – in estaminet having an omelette with Major Murray and our Signallers. We are staying here for our three month’s rest. Splendid having Xmas out of the line especially so far back as this where we cannot even hear the guns. the Battalion will march in here tomorrow shortly after midday.\n","272":" – Busy all day arranging permanent billets, transport lines and acting as interpreter for Major Murray. He was billeted with Monsieur Marie who would not believe that he was a Major (Commandant), but took him as a Sergeant-Major. When informed that his guest was second-in-command of a Battalion he was astonished, saying that the English Sergent Major had far more shiny buttons stripes and badges than Murray, who was dressed like a digger, except for the dark crown on each shoulder,\n\nand his V.V. DSO. (bar) and DCM. ribbons.\n\nThe billets were fair but hard, so we scoured the country looking for straw to buy for sleeping upon. Unsuccessful except for 25 small \nsheafs\n beaten sheafs for 15 francs.\n","273":"\n The Bn. marched in and started to \"dig in\" for the well earned three month’s rest.\n","274":" Church Parade in the fields near Friville followed by a \"March Past\" the \"Brig\". Then with Major Murray I visited all the factories in or near the town trying to arrange for the establishment of baths \nand\n or supply of water. We had a long, but unsuccessful , chat with the Marie on the same subject, unsuccessful because the town had no stream or reservoir near it, the people depending upon their own supplies of rain water. I then visited a British hay dump – several stacks bought by the Army for fodder and guarded by a\"Tommy\" Guard – and reconnoitred how our men could get to them tonight to steal enough hay to keep them a bit warmer than the hard boards or brick floors without it. I yarned with the \"Tommy\" sentries\n\nand found out the Sergeant’s movements. He generally went to his billet at 8 pm. Batallion funds supplied me with a bottle of Spanish Rhum – the only decent liquor available – and with this I approached the hay stacks at 8.30 pm, entered into conversation with the sentries about how I could find their officer, who was billeted about 15 miles away, \nand\n the cold weather, etc, and enticed them into their hut to join their comrades and myself in the Rhum. We yarned freely about Devon and Somerset for an hour. When I repassed the haystacks I noticed that one of them, at least, appeared shorter. It might have been imagination but a company of diggers armed with string and rope can move a lot of hay in an hour. I was afraid their tracks would be seen by pieces of straw lying about but they had been too careful for that. I shall never visit the Tommies there again \n\n \n\nLts Joe Westwood and Roy Withers were in charge of the raiders.\n","275":" Have been occupied looking for stables for 70 A.S.C. horses and mules and 30 of our own mules. It is difficult to find places, because the big farmers won’t give stables without being forced to, and the Marie is on their side; and the small farmers to whom the Marie sends me, complain that it is unfair for them to have to provide all the cover for the animals.\n\nHad an interesting lecture this evening Col. Durrant in \"Discipline\".\n\nLast night the guard stole, or allowed to be stolen, 4 fowls and 4 rabbits. I investigated the complaint by Madame, who claimed 100 francs damages, making each rabbit at 15 francs – only ordinary rabbits too – and each fowl 10 francs. In the end she accepted 50 francs, and gave me a full receipt. The Guard has to pay the sum into Regimental funds.\n","276":" Just received sudden orders to be prepared to move to an unknown destination immediately. We think is in connection with Byng’s push at Cambrai, or rather a push by Fritz there. Today I completed making arrangements for our Company’s Xmas Dinner, hired a hall, arranged for crockery etc., ordered turkeys and arranged for their fattening and ordered wine and beer. Rather stiff having to move again after a fortnight’s preparation making and settling down, for less than a fortnight’s rest. Very cold and sleety.\n","277":" – the men naturally are very disappointed. We all are, as we really believed we were at last out for our dinkum rest. Since arriving in France the","278":" Division has not had a clear month’s rest. Our Brigade has to its credit since the Somme Battle started, Poziers, Mouquet Farm, Flers, Guedecourt (Stormy French), Bapaume Bullecourt, Messines, Gapaard, Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke to say nothing of long periods of heavy digging and carrying on the Somme and around Ypres and Messines. All in a little over a year, and each action meant week’s of slogging preparatory\n\nwork. No wonder men break up occasionally and unreasonably blame the ’Brig\", General MacLagan, Birdwood, and even \"Billy Hughes. Perhaps they are right in feeling that a determined stand by our commanding officers would get them the rest they deserve. They say that, like the Guards, we are shock troops; but that, unlike the Guards, who do a few truly wonderful things in a war are not taken out after successful fighting but kept in near the line on wearisome fatigues. In spite of their disappointment however, they are extremely jocular over it. No wonder the people of \"Blighty\" didn’t understand our men. No one does.\n\nAs Bn. Bombing Officer I spent this morning organising bombs in preparation for our move.\n","279":" – In a Nissen Bow-hut at Moislains about 6 miles north of Peronne. Can hear the guns from the Hindenburg line quite plainly. Yesterday was a busy day. In the morning as Battalions interpreter I inquired into several claims made by the French people of Woincourt. We had sent the\n\ntown-crier around asking for claims to be sent in immediately. No pay was available and many men wanted small debts paid by Regimental funds, and to repay some \n when they\n on next payday. These were fixed up. Christmas orders were also cancelled by mutual consent. Other cases were more difficult. The Transport drivers had tethered mules to fruit trees, thus ringbarking these entirely, and damaging two. Claim was 100 francs but I got the owner to take 80. A woman claimed 50 francs for a lost room warmer. We found it in \"A\" Coy billets and returned it. A second woman claimed 70 francs for woodwork of a lathe machine burned. Finally she accepted 25 quite agreeably. If these claims had gone on to Division we should have had to pay them in full, as our Divisional Claims Officer always seems to \n pass \n order the payment asked for by the French, without taking much notice of the Battalion’s side of the question at all. I found a Fleming near Steenvoorde who had a \"stock\" stump of a gate post on which he had regularly claimed 70 francs from all outgoing troops. As troops came in each day and departed the next, he\n\nhad made quite a good thing out of it, until I received his claim. \nGoing to \n On interviewing him he stated that the battalion had stolen his gate, \nand\n burnt it, and had even started on the post when he came along and surprised them. His gate was worth 200 francs, but he would be satisfied with 70. The Australians were thoughtless troops and didn’t realize how valuable the gate was. There were the new axe marks and some new chips. I didn’t like the farmer’s manner and didn’t believe him, so I placed the facts before the men and asked them to tell me \"square dinkum\" if the gate had been burnt in their billet. The digger, when asked a straight out question like this, can always be relied on to give the \"dinkum\" answer. They were certain the gate had not been touched, although they admitted taking a \n leg\n rail of a fence lying on the ground from a farmer near by. I visited this farm and found a very friendly cheerful madame, who stated the soldiers had taken the said rail, she had seen them, but as it\n\nwas quite an old one they were welcome. She didn’t like the \"Gate-post stump\" farmer; so I ordered a cup of coffee and entered into a conversation about our friend and was very agreeably surprised to find out that he had had no gate there for years, that he had already been paid a great many times for it during \n the past \n the war and that his habit was to make a few fresh chips himself each evening. It was lucky for him that the battalion had marched out before I got back, for a quiet unofficial word to a few diggers would have had him dumped into his foul-smelling manure hole. As it was I could only tell him that if ever he made a similar claim again he would probably \n get into trouble \n be shot and that the matter would be reported to the French Mission.\n\nLast night we passed through Abbeville just after dark. The train started before its time and Colonel Marks and other officers\n\nwere left behind. After a long run they caught up and climb onto an open truck where they had to stop until we reached Amiens two hours later. It was frightfully cold and sleety all the way too. None of us are game to mention an open truck journey in winter to the C.O. now.\n\nWe detrained at Peronne at 10 pm, and marched along frozen roads, slipping and stumbling all the way. One man, on his third heavy fall \n exlaim \n caused \ngreat\n much amusement by exclaiming with great vehemence \" ---- Billy Hughes!\" He had evidently been in deep thought just as fell. As we left Peronne a big black smelly billy-goat joined in our march at the head of a company. We couldn’t drive him away so he is still in our lines near the cookers. He must be a mascot of some of the Welsh battalions recently almost wiped out in the German push. We reached this camp about 2 am this morning and slept very cold until after 10 this morning. A plane dropped several bombs near us. After breakfast we examined the\n\nGrand Canal due Nord, which when finished will run from Peronne to Douai and Lille. The bridges over it are all destroyed, and its banks full of deep blown-in German dugouts. This town of Moislains was evidently populous and prosperous but now every place is shattered. Tombs in the churchyard have been opened and ravaged, and the church itself is a sorry spectacle. We salvaged a big old stove, and four of us carried it back to our hut where it is now giving out splendid heat, but consuming rather too much wood, of which, however there is a plentiful supply form the ruins.\n","280":" – Just come in from an \"open warfare stunt\" During \"Smoke-Ho\" the acting adjutant, Lt Blythman, read the Referendum Proclamation by the Prime Minister, and the C.O. allowed any man or N.C.O. to speak for or against the question. No officer was allowed to speak. The majority I think will vote \"Yes\" but with a big \"No\" minority.

My ear is aching. During the Pierrot Show last night we received orders to be ready to move at an hour’s notice – towards Cambrai we expect. There has been a heavy bombardment for the past twenty four hours. I have just made a big pot of porridge for \"C\" and \"D\" officers.

Everyone in the hut \nand everyone\n has been bitten and every visitor is treated likewise. Our new Padre came in \n a few nights \n last night and introduced himself.\n\nHe had hardly said \"I am your new Padre\" before he was seized by \nLieut Withers \n Roy W, Joe W and Bill P., and bitten on both ears. He is now a member of the hut and can visit us freely. The officers in this hut are – \n\n\"C\" Coy – Capt R.

Bone, \"Doss\" Wallack, D’Arcy Henry, Lieuts Sid Owen, Dick Swinbourne, D’Arcy-Irvine, Wolman, Joe Watson, Alan Lilley and G Smith.\n\nThere is not much training done here on account of the weather. The men have had three hot baths in a fortnight and two changes of underclothing. Foot inspections are held daily, also foot rubbing and powdering.\n\nThe Brigade Competitions in football and the Pierrot Show go on regularly.\n","283":" – 9 pm. Have just made the Supper Porridge. A bleak windy night with snow everywhere.\n","284":" 3 pm. Sun is shining low down, wind is bitingly cold and strong. I have just bought a case of Dawson’s Whisky for the mess for 60 francs, gave a bottle to our cooks. Wrote to Mrs. Ross of Deniliquin in reply to her inquires re the graves of her two sons.\n","285":" – In tent at Templeux la Fosse. The march from Moislains was short, but difficult on account of the frozen roads. Many of us had severe falls, I myself severely bruising my hip. Horses and mules were hurt badly by slipping, and in some places it was impossible for a mule to walk at all. These tents are on a bare hill. They are very old, and many badly torn. The men are all making or salvaging braziers of some sort or other. As the Germans ringbarked all the fruit trees for miles in this district we have plenty of dry wood which but for their thoughtfulness we would not have been permitted to use. The","286":" Battalion salvaged a haystack – found by Major Murray about two miles away. The tents had been nicely lined with it when Division sent word to take it all back. It must belong to the Army for these are no civilians near here. All\n\nthat could not be hidden under ground sheets has to be carried back. I imagine Division Hqrs are afraid of offending the \"Tommy\" Generals \n under \n to whom we are now attached. We are just one Australian division in a \"Tommy\" Corps, and since coming here have learnt to appreciate our own Corps the more.\n","287":" To night enemy planes dropped about 20 bombs near us but they all missed the camp. Heavy firing North of Cambrai and near St Quentin. – \n","288":" – In tent near Templeux la Fosse. Snow everywhere and very cold. Rations all round were very much better today as Regimental Funds assisted, and in addition we had a parcel each from Australian Comforts. The Canteen also had in a good stock, so each tent squad seemed to enjoy itself. We were very disappointed at being unable to have Company dinners but it was an absolute impossibility in small tents. Our parcels were less numerous than\n\nlast year on account of the submarines. My Xmas parcel contained 2 packets of cigarettes from Victoria, a tin of lollies from the school at Boulder City (W. Australia) and a pair of socks from N.S.W.- As mess secretary I arranged Xmas dinner for our few officers. Luckily we had all received parcels from home and these arrived, as also did a turkey weighing 12 ½ pounds live weight, for which I paid the canteen 40 francs. The hors d’ouvres consisted of olives from Sydney Civil Service Stores, and two sorts of sardines, the turtle soup was sent to our O.C. \nfrom London\n Capt. McKillop, from London; the lobster was tinned, the partridges were shot by Lt Parsonage up near the Hindenburg Line where he had a working party yesterday, the roast pullet came in a tin from London (very nice too); the turkey was the piece d’resistance, the ham was good, and we enjoyed it although we get ham or bacon every day, the potatoes were just enough as we did without any\n\nyesterday; the beans came in tins from the Civil Service, Sydney and also some of the peas and asparagus, the Xmas puddings – three of them came from Sydney, London and the South of England the \nfruits\n crystallized fruits, raisins and lollies came in private parcels from Australia, and we bought the drinks from our Brigade Canteen. Our menu, signed by C.L. Luscombe, W. Parsonage, H. Simpson, \nJ.E. White\n, T. A. White, Alan Brierly and Roy Withers, was as follows: - \n\nHorsd’ouvres varies (au Bois Grenier)\n\nConsome tortue verte (a la boue de Somme)\n\nHomard Mayonnaise (a la Poziers, tres chaud)\n\nPerdrix rotis (a la ferme de Mouquet)\n\nPoulet roti (a St Eloi)\n\nDindon d’Ypres roti et Jambon de Euendecourt\n\nPommes de terre roties (aux grand obus)\n\nLegumes et petis pois\/aux mitrailleuses de Bullencourt)\n\nAsperges de Messines au beurre (a la Ploegstraet)\n\nPounding de Noel (au \"Micky\" et \"Paddy\" de Gapaard)\n\nDessert – Fruits assortis\/au Bois de Polygon)\n\nRaisins et Dattes (a la Pillbox)\n\nFromage Gruyere\/aux Shellholes et craters)\n\nVins de Chlorine – Whiskey a la Petrole, Champagne a gaz Zounebeke, Liqueur de Perrons\n\nCafé de Cambrai\n\nDress – Clean fatigue (sheep-skins optional)\n\nFall in – a la Chelsea\n\nG.S. Wagons – 4 p.m.\n","289":" – Had a Brigade rearguard stunt today. It was bitterly cold with a strong North wind blowing. The snow was like fine sugar and was blown sharply into our faces, the hairs of our heads and moustaches soon became covered\n\nwith these fine grains of \nfrozen\n snow which grew larger and formed icicles on every hair. Still the men were so cherry that Gn. Brand complimented them on their splendid work under such exceptionally trying circumstances. This evening I went to the","290":" Bde, Pierrots, to see the pantomime \"Cinderella\". It was really an excellently arranged affair and was thoroughly enjoyed by all. I am detailed to visit the front line for observation purposes tomorrow.\n","291":" – Have just returned from a visit to the front line in Gauche Wood, S. of Gauzeaucourt. Very tiresome walk on frozen roads and duckboards, and my feet are now rather sore. With three other officers from the Bde, I visited the King’s Own Scottish Borderers, Scottish Rifles, and South African Scottish. The British and German here work in view of each other without firing a shot. It is a case of \"Leave Fritz alone if he is quiet\", - quite contrary to our Australian idea of strapping him whenever we get the opportunity. Hence our Bn. has never yet been raided, simply because we make Fritz keep his head down and so see nothing.\n\nIn the K.O.S.B. every man looked thoroughly clean, and as spick and span as if on parade on London. They shave every morning and shine up even in the front line. Their officers’ mess cart returning from Peronne with their Xmas whiskey and three officers’ valises \ndrove\ngot off the track and drove into the German lines on Xmas Eve, Poor Scotties, lucky Fritzes!\n","292":" – New Year’s Eve – rather cold with plenty of snow about. All had a beautiful hot bath and clean change of underclothes yesterday. The referendum result is a surprise to us. Some of our Battalians will have to be broken up as reinforcements to others, which seems a dammed shame.\n","293":" – 12.5 am – Our Band is playing the New Year in. It started with \"God Save\", and then came \"Auld Lang Syne\". Our regimental march \"When We Come Home Dear!\" and finishing with \"What’s the Use of Worrying?\" The front is very quiet at present, only a big gun or two in the distance sending Fritz over New Year’s presents. This show ought to finish by next New Year. It would have been over now but for the Russian collapse. The Germans have absolutely got to be beaten, that’s one certainty.\n\n1st. Jan 1918 – A clear cold day. Snow everywhere. Australian Lewis Gunners brought down a German plane today. It was very exciting watching it trying to escape. It fell near Divisional Hqrs.\n","294":" – My left hand is bound up on account of a severe burning through our tent catching fire. My batsman came back from his \"Blighty\" leave on","295":" and was completely over-joyed when he heard that a sentence of 10 years against him had been completely \nof\ncancelled. It was good to see him. He had received 10 years for desertion at Bullencourt in April – in the opinion of many who knew him his absence was caused through a misunderstanding and utter fatigue – but since then he had shown conspicuous gallantry and cheerful devotion to duty at Messines, Gapard and Polygon Wood that four different officers had recommended him for Distinguished Conduct on four different occasions. Having a sentence against him however prevented him receiving decorations, so I continuously urged, with the heartiest \nsupport\n backing of Captain R.H. Browning, the cancellation of his sentence. We also urged his being granted \"Blighty\" leave even before the cancellation. He received this leave, and on his return the official intention of the wiping out of his sentence.\n\nEnemy ‘planes – a Zeppelin also was reported – were over the\n\ncamp for a considerable time last night. We ourselves hard the peculiar throbbing of the Zepplin engines, we took it to be – but were not sure as we could see nothing. Divisional Hqrs were bombed and three men killed. As Bn. Bombing Officer I have been conducting live bomb throwing and rifle grenade practice with Mills’ and Hales’ Grenades\n","296":" – Anniversary of my Wedding Day 8 years ago. This afternoon I too the \"dud\" bombers and those who had done no recent \"live\" throwing. Warm today and so very muddy on account of the thaw. This winter is not nearly so severe as \nthat\n last. During any thaw all vehicular traffic is \nalong the\n stopped \nin the\n on account of the damage done to the roads then.\n\n15.1.18 – Midday – Generals Braidwood and MacLagan are inspecting our camp at present, it is raining, and as a thaw has set in the whole place is frightfully sloppy. We are now in Belgium in huts at Locre near Canada Corner. The Camp is Curragh Camp. We left Templeaux-la-Fosse on the 10th, marched to Perrone, during which march\n\nwe had several accidents through the hard slippery state of the road. At Perrone we entrained for Baillleul via Albert, where several men, who had got out onto the platform to get their tea, were left behind on account of the tram starting without warning. Arrived at Bailleul after midnight we detrained in knee deep mud, received a cup of cocoa each from the Y.M.C.A., and marched to the Northern outskirts of Meterem, arriving there a4.30 am. The next day we marched back through Bailleul to this camp. Here we are comfortable in decent huts with excellent food supplies and plenty of fuel. We are back with the Australian Corps again. The day before yesterday I visited - in company with Lt Manfeld – la Clytte, Kemmel and la Laiterie. Here we have Battlion Mess with Major H Pulling as President.\n\n17th – Bn. dinner this evening as a farewell to Major Pulling on his departure for the Indian Army. Col. Durrant was present. To while away the time we had a source of lecturettes on some ensuing things that had baffled to various officers. \n\n1 \nCol. Marks\n The list was as follows: - \n\n1. \"How to view France from an Open Truck\" – Col. Marks.\n\n2. \"Transport and How to Find It\" – Capt T Wells\n\nCapt. \"Bomb\" Wells today volunteered to guide some officers to the Transport Lines. There are dozens of military roads hereabouts, and after guiding his friends for two hours they arrived back here from where they had set out. \n\n3. \"Variety Entertainments and their Value to the Troops\" Capt R.H. Browning – Capt Browing is very antagonistic to the various Pierrot Shows, Smart Sets etc. He has repeatedly expressed his opinion most strongly that the members of these shows should take their turn in the line, that their work there would relieve others who couldn’t get a rest, and\n\nthat the transport necessary for the troopes and their equipment could be put to better is. Hence he was listed for the lecturette\n\n4. \"Paper and Cardboard and how to Save it\" by Capt A.W. Davis –We never waste a bit of paper or cardboard, and they are very scarce and are required for munitions So it is a crime to burn even a small piece of either, and Capt Davis, our adjutant is in charge of this saving department.\n","297":" \"Blighty, and How to Stay There\" . Major Pulling. The Major received a wound in his \"sit down\" and was \nstayed\n away six months with it.\n","298":" \"Duties of an Orderly Officer and How he should Dress in the Line of March\" Lieut N. Lieut N. dressed carelessly, although he was splendid in every other way, and he had a pair of breeches that we had chiacked him about, and had often advised him to burn. One day recently on a long march he\n\nwas Orderly Officer and so should have made himself a bit more decent than usual, but he didn’t, and also wore these breeches. As it happened the Colonel heard that General Brant was waiting to see us march past, and catching sight of N. (in charge of a few prisoners) he exclaimed \"For God’s sake, N -, march among the prisoners so that the General won’t notice you are an officer.\"\n","299":" \"The Pen is Mightier than the Sword\" or \"How to Get Whiskey from Divisional Hqrs.\" By Lt. J. East. Lt. East, having been on Division before coming to the Bn. knew the ropes there as well as the staff, and a note from him generally procured Whiskey if any could be had anywhere. \n","300":" \"How to Win the War\" Chaplain Hinsley. In his second sermon to the Bn. the Padre told us all one sins, and urged that to win the war we must\n\nalter our drinking, gambling, swearing etc. He offended a good many and received many bumps on return, but he stood them well and is rapidly becoming more popular.\n\nWe have chosen a splendid body of men to raid the enemy when we enter the line shortly. They are in charge of Capt. Doss Wallack and Lt. Geo Marfer – two splendid officers in whom the men have the greatest confidence, I am putting them through \"live\" bombing each day, especially with the new \"British Egg\" bomb – a handy little bomb weighing 9 oz.. The men however prefer the 22 oz \"Johnny Mills\". A German Propaganda Balloon came down where we were having our bombing on","301":" It \nconsisted of\n was of red paper inflated, and had a bundle of newspapers suspended from it. These newspapers were in French and purported to be printed by the French in the German-occupied parts of France. They were meant for French peasants, and \nstated\naimed at causing disaffection against England. England was gaining everything at the expense of her allies, she would hold on to Calais and the North of France if the Allies won, the Germans treated the\n\nFrench and Belgians in the occupied parts, and even the prisoners of war with the most astonishing kindness. When they were forced to make them evacuate a town near the line they saw that everything possible was taken by the evacues and even helped them; \nbut it","302":" unlike what the English would do as could be seen from the picture illustrating their brutality to the Boers. \nIt\n these papers had pictures of English prisoners in most delightful surroundings, with well stocked canteens, music halls and even quilts on their beds. They were God’s own people – these kind Germans, and all the trouble was caused by England who would drop France when it suited her – such was the stream of these papers.\n\n19th January – Have just returned from the line in Hollebeke sector which the Bn. takes over tomorrow. I visited Oak Dump, White chateau, Spoil Bank and 48th Bn Hqrs. Major \"Tubby\" Allan is C.O. of the 48th (temporarily)\n\nThere are very good quarters underground at Bn. Hqrs and in the basement of White Chateau. My work is to act as Salvage Officer, Bn. Bombing Officer and Forward Quartermaster, with the headquarters in White Chateau. I have 4 men at Oak Dump, and 10- at Chateau as a permanent water carrying party. \n\nJan 29th In Bow Headquarters on the bank of the Ypres – Comines Canal. We have been in the line here for nine days, holding a line of outposts and a Support Trench at Hollebeke, and between that village site and the Canal, with a post on the other side of the Canal. Ithas been very cold and muddy all the time. The Germand evidently were enot sure of our positions, nor we of theirs. Consequently there was a lot of Patrol work on both sides, ours being done by out raiders. We also wired our positions rather strongly.\n\nAnxious to know what German regiments was in front of us, many attempts were made to get an identification, my\n","303":" days’ leave being promised to the one who got the identification, dead or alive. It came to a patrol to find the body of a German who had been shot from an outpost in a fog one morning. The outpost believed they had shot several but had been unable to find a body. The patrol found and searched it, bringing back papers and the identification disc and paybook. Among the papers was a photo of the dead German N.C.O. and Russians fraternising thus establishing that this regiment had recently been on the Russian Front. He belonged to Aubalt and to the 93rd, - a first class German division, - very good to know this.\n\nOur Company Commanders in charge in the line were Capts. \"Bob\" Henderson, R.H. Browning, \"Bob\" McKillop and E. Moseley. On Wednesday Joe Westwood was Works Officer, Harry Davis Intelligence Officer; Capt \"Son\" Davis Adjutant, Geo Falkiner, Signalling Officer, Les Cleland Spare Parts\n\nmyself Bombs, Salvage and forward 2M, and Col. Marks C.O.\n\nAlthough cold \nand muddy\n the weather was better than we expected. Great care was taken by all ranks of the feet, socks, being exchanged daily, and feet washed and rubbed with talc powder regularly. Hence we had no trench feet. Our casualties were one wounded and a few sick during the 9 days in. the food was good and reached even the outposts quite hot in large Thermos Cases. The Front Outposts received hot stew or curry at 7 pm, hot soup or cocoa and milk at midnight, bacon, bread, jam and cheese, and rum at 6.30 am. – The Supports received their meals at 5 pm, 11 pm, and 7 am, and in addition hot tea at 11 am. So the ration party had plenty to do. The \"Australian Comforts\" supplied us with 20 cases of cocoa and enabled us to supply all working partners with a hot nourishing drink at any hour of the day or night, no\n\nmatter to what Bn. they belonged.\n\nDuring this period no vehicle returned from Oak Dump to the Transport Lines without a load of salvage – such as old rifles, equipment, tank parts, gun wheels, shell cases.\n\nEvery man \nof\n going back empty handed was expected to pick up and carry back something to the dump. Notices stared him in the face along the duckboarad tracks. \"Where’s Your Bit of Salvage?\". \"Anything is Useful, Don’t let it Sink in the Mud!\". \"THANKS. Drop it Here!\" \nwere\n are samples of these Salvage notices.\n\nHave just issued some biscuits to be given with the cocoa to the working parties. They came through Australian Comforts, and are \"From the Loyal Women of South Australia to the Fighting Men\". As each man receives his course \nand\n he dips his hand in the tin and takes what he wants. He then generally drinks the health of these woman in his cocoa.\n\nThis \"White Chateau\" is reported to have had a romantic history, and to have been a home for Leopold of Belgium. At present about 300 men are living in its basements. It would take a tremendous shell to get through the mass of its ruins on top of us. These men live here during the day but at night the Chateau is empty except for the cooks for all are engaged carrying or digging.\n\nI have just returned from a visit to Crater, Canal and Gaspres Tunnels. The 16th. Bn. are there. They come in here tonight, and we go there.\n","304":" In \nCanal\nCrater Tunnels on the East bank of the Ypres-Comines Canal. Still going well and strong, although I haven’t had a change of underclothes, except socks for over three weeks, in fact haven’t been undressed \nfor\n since","305":" I have walked miles and miles under ground in these tunnels – adding it all up – and repeatedly bumped my head against the tunnel roof. The Canadian Tunnellers constructed this underground labyrinth. One requires a stooping walk, walking about underground and bumping his head continually against a low post of the roof. Many of our tunnels have electric lights and decent but hard-bunks, many are constantly dripping, \nand\n are ankle-deep in water, and require pumping day and night, but still we can rest here as we are free from shells and\n\ngas. Several thousand men living, - cooking, sleeping etc. underground require some tunnels. Several of us have husky and irritable throats caused by whiffs of gas. Fritz has been constantly sending over gas shells lately on our left, but they have been particularly wasted – good luck. We bluff him a lot and he pours shells into where we make him think our guns are, but where they are not. It is interesting to watch him blow a faked position to pieces day after day. I suppose he bluffs us the same.\n\nOne company of the Bn in Canal Tunnels \nare having a\n had an unfortunately sloppy time. These Tunnels – unlike ours and Gaspus Tunnels – have no electric lights, ventilators and pumps. During this week the 14th Bn. – in the front line on the left of the Canal – suffered heavy gas casualties, about 100 \nmen\n being evacuated. A party of our men working near the","306":" Bn. had about 20 gas evacuations. We also have many ill with stomach troubles – caused evidently by their drinking shell-hole water.\n\nWhile we were at Crater Dugouts I was nicknamed the \"Canal Admiral\" because, to save carrying our supplies \nthis\n a long distance, I borrowed two punts from the Canadians, and on these, with 4 men, we carried each trip as much as 44 men had done in twice the time.\n","307":" Back with the Bn. at Curragh Camp, Locre We came back from Spoil Bank on Decauville trains to Kilmarnock Siding near La Clytte. Capt John Brown, well known in the","308":" Bde, is town Major of La Clytte.\n\nOur band met us near Divisional Headquarters and its good music cheered us and livened our heavy legs somewhat. the bandsmen were is good form as they has been left out of the line to play for Division at La Clytte..\n\nThis evening a party of us visited the","309":" Division Smart Set in the Loire Hall. A really good entertainment.\n","310":" Everybody cleaning up.\n\nA yarn is told of a recent visit to the Hollebeke Area by General Birdwood and Col. Durrant. Passing two men salvaging \"Birdie\", as usual spoke to them. \"Good day, my man!\" \"Good day, sir!\" \"Good day my man, to the second \"Good day,sir! Everything all right?\" \"Not too bad, sir, replied the first, while the second replied,\n\n \"We must be winning, sir.\" \n\n\"I’m very pleased to hear you say that, my man, but what \nmakes you say so\n special thing makes you say so? \"Birdie continued in his quick peculiar way of speaking.\n\n\"Thirteen to a loaf last night, sir, and eighteen to a tin of Jam!\"\n\n\"Well I’ m pleased to hear that. I’m glad the rations are getting forward as well. Good day, my \nman\n\"\n\n\"Good day, sir.\"\n\nThe diggers regarded each other for a few seconds with countenances that said more than words, then as \"Birdie\" wound along the duckboards he heard No 1 digger remark to his cobber\n\n\"You came a gutzer, Tom!\"\n\n\"What does he mean by that? \"Birdwood immediately asked \nDurrant\n Col. Durrant.\n\nThe Col. explained that the issue of bread should be two loaves to five men \nto two loaves\n and not thirteen to one loaf. \"And that man didn’t mean what he said?\" \nhe asked in his quick peculiar way. \"No it was just his say\n\nAs they continued along the track, the General remarked to himself several times \"I must go into these little details!\"\n\nTwo of our Lewis Guns had for some time not been giving satisfaction to the crews using them. They could not get them exchanged while they looked \nalong\n all right, so just before coming out of the forward area they burst Mills ‘bombs’ against them. Then it was quite an easy job to get complete new guns in exchange for those \"destroyed by shell-fire.\" A big waste, but it was necessary to use a bomb, and to destroy a whole gun in order to have a small defect remedied.\n","311":" – Walked to Kemmel to","312":" Field Ambulance to have a tooth treated.\n","313":" – At Curragh Camp. Accompanied C.O. Col. Marks), Adjutant (Capt A.W. Davis) and","314":" in Command (Capt. R.H. Browning) to forward area near Hollebeke, \nand\n White Chateau and Spoil Bank. We are to go in here again on","315":" for another holding-on and raiding period. I examined Bomb stores and Gas curtains at White Chateau, Bn. Hqrs., and Support Trench, as I am to be \nforward\n Bombing Officer & forward 2.M. again. It seems solid sending the Brigade in to the line here again so soon without even a day’s rest. True we have been out of the line to sleep, and personally I have had a good rest here, but the Company officers and men have had a very heavy \"working-party\" time, visiting Spoil-bank and White Chateau area, digging and wiring every day – even Sunday – for long hours, leaving camp daily at 5 am. All this work is in case Fritz pushes near here. The \"Brass Hats\" all seem to expect him to attack strongly soon. He certainly seems suspicious, as he is making big reserve dumps, and long range shelling\n\nour back areas. Still I think our Brigade has had more than its fair share of fatigues. \n\nDuring the week a German ‘plane was brought down among the men of this working party who quickly souvenired it and its occupants. A few hours later a Yank airman motored up as far as Spoilbank and walked across to where the ‘plane had fallen to get a souvenir, as it was, he said, his ‘plane as he had brought it down, and as it was his first one, he wanted something to remind him of it later on in America. But there was absolutely nothing left for him to souvenir. \"Wal you chaps are some rapid, no error\" he remarked somewhat sorely, \"I guess the next Bosche I bring down I’ll souvenir him up above\". Finding he was willing to give a few dollars for something to remind him, a couple of diggers near a dump of salvaged German ammunition quickly brought him a handful of\n\nof \"the poor blighter’s bullets.\"\n\nI have had a party of 8 salvaging the Canada Corner area. There is Keen competition between the battalions in salvaging, the","316":" Bn. salvaging, and sending back to Division, \nal Dump\n an Engineer Company’s dump, much to the annoyance of the latter people who had gone to a lot of trouble getting the material up there. I tested the \"Killing power\" of our small \"British Egg\" bombs today by bursting one in a strong iron drum. It not only \nbrot\n turned the drum completely inside out, but made over 400 holes in it, any one of which in the right place would kill a man. One small piece went an inch into a hard wood post over 100 yards away. And they weigh only 9 ounces. We \nI\n had previously tested the \"Mills\" by bursting one suspended \nover\n in a large cubical box made of three fold hard wood boards each an inch thick. There were over 400 \"Killing pieces\", over \nthree\n 300 having entered\n\nthe second board and over 200 the third board, and there were innumerable \"dust\" marks from the size of a pin head down all over the first board. That the Mills’ fragments carried some distance was proved at Lyndhurst Bombing School when a piece of the bomb went through a man’s hand over 200 yards away.\n\n19th..

We have a raiding party of 40 men in charge of Capt \"Doss\" Wallack and Lt George Marfer. Beautifully moonlight tonight – too bright for comfortable wiring and patrolling. Our 60-pounder guns are active, but on the whole things are quiet. Fritz gives our outposts, \nand\n supports and tracks a good deal of machine gun sweeping, and the outposts trench-mortar bombs such as \"pineapples\" and \"flying pigs\". His \"pinemines\" have been active today on our dumps\n\nand duckboards. Our men are kept going solidly.

This is the usual procedure every morning lately as the heads are windy over Fritz and the push he is going to make. The","320":" Bn. \nhave\n also march up and stand-to. They have a long heavy march up here and back. We stand down about 6 am. Received a parcel from Australia last night containing socks, tobacco, soap and cocoa.\n","321":" 1 a.m. In \nWhite\n Bn.Hqrs. – All bustle as we expect a big German attack on our left. I have just come in – raining heavily – from seeing to the forwarding of S.A.A. and bombs to the Strong Points. (I had previously placed 34,000 rounds of S.A.A. in two of those Strongposts but Lt. C. salvaged it). Fritz will get a hot time if he includes this part in his attack. A prisoner captured by the English on our left gave the information concerning the attack, and this has been supported by other evidence\n\neg. aeroplane photos showing great activity, and telephone messages caught by our listening sets. One of our Sigs. catches messages from Eiffel Tower regularly, so we get the latest news even when we can’t get the \"Daily Mail\". Salvaged 4 pill-boxes yesterday.\n","322":" pm.\n\nIn hut at Tournai Camp – just out of the line – waiting for the others to come in. The men are dribbling in by twos and threes and receiving a hot meal upon arrival. At present we are barraging the enemy very heavily with big stuff. The discharges are louder, and shake the place more than any artillery I have ever heard – the big gun near by is evidently a 14-incher, it shakes the hut so much that it seems to be collapsing. The enemy heavy shells are searching for it and are falling near here quite frequently. Our men coming back from the line will have a nervy time, also the tenth Bn going\n\nin, as they are relieving tonight.\n\nThe firing has increased in intensity – to an S.O.S. pitch. – I am trying to hear the 18-pounders, but the bigger guns are drowning them completely if they are firing. Any machine gun barrage there may be is also drowned.\n\nWe have just finished 10 days (our second period) in the Hollebeke and Ypres-Comines Canal Sector, with but six casualties up to this evening. There are sure to be some in this barrage coming over now – Our Raiders were on fighting patrol of covering parties every night, but although they made No Man’s Land absolutely ours, they didn’t get a chance of taking a prisoner for identification. The German position was very strongly wired in and every pill box was covered by others and surrounded by heavy belts of wire – barbed and concertina – The barrage is still of S.O.S. intensity. I heard our Machine Gun barrage rattling out just now during a momentary lull.\n\nSome of our men coming in had a rough time. A few seem rattled. Several casualties are reported. The German barrage is reported to be of exceptional intensity. They are perhaps attacking or preparing to.\n","323":" 1 am. Tournai Camp – Poor Luscombe has gone. He was a splendid young officer too – so cheery and willing. And Capt.\"Hampt\" Browning is about \"out\" too, - dangerously wounded in kidneys. Several men have also gone west. Hard luck just after being relieved!\n\nThe bombardment has died down a great deal, but still the firing is abnormal. The Germans raided our Outpost Headquarters just after the","324":" Bn. had taken over and before the relief was complete. They opened their raid with a hurricane of fire of \"minnies\" and machine guns, and then brought down a 4.2 and 5.9 barrage on our Supports Communications and Rear. We had just handed over to","325":" Bn. when the raid commenced. \"C\" Company\n\nwere in the Communication Trench – Oak Avenue – and caught the barrage – Lieut Luscombe and four men being killed and six wounded. Capt. R.H. Browning had waited in the outpost Hqrs talking matters over with the Major in charge of this Company of the 10th and was captured with the Major. However the Support Line Company, under Lieut Scott, gallantly counter attacked and fired into the retiring Boche Killing over 20 of them. Unfortunately our Lewis guns got some of our own people among the retiring Bosche, Killing the Major and wounding Capt Browning.\n\n9 pm – In a dirty dark billet in Neuve Eglise (West Nievw Kerke). We marched back here today through Kemmel. A party went forward early this morning to bury our people killed last night. Capt. Browning is very low. I prefer a tent or military hut to these billets. – \n\n6th March – We all had a hot shower at Palmer Baths today, and changed our underclothing. Capt Browning so much improved that there is every prospect of his pulling through.\n","326":" – At Australian Corps Gas School at Erckenghem. Weather delightful. Arrived here yesterday evening.\n","327":" Went through various lachrymatory and lethal gases and a room of heavy smoke in our masks. Tested various gasses. We are camped in huts among tall solid trees now coming out into leaves. Plenty of birds about. We get a fine view of 9 villages towards Calais and St. Omer. The big guns can be heard rumbling very distinctly. Finished \"The Bohemians of the Latin Quarter\" and the \"The Green Curve\" Lt. \"Tod\" Sloane (15th Bn.) has kept us all most interested with his yarns.\n\n18th. At Neuve Eglise. Am Sports Officer for Bn. and Bde. Sports to be held shortly.\n\n22nd. March. Enemy still shelling our area with high velocity shells, \"rubber heels,\" – so called because they slip over so quickly and quietly, the bursting near one \nbefo\n being the first sound one hears. As they go over us they screech and wail dismally He is using some\n\nof our own shells on us especially 6-inch naval shells obtained by him from Russia. He captured a 6-inch naval gun at Cambrai and he is believed to be firing this one from Lille into our area.\n\nToday was Battalion Sports Day but the sports were only half hearted, for everyone felt depressed on account of our tug-of-war team being wiped out this morning. A terrible loss indeed. The twelve strongest men in the Bn, including Lieut John Brown M.A. were engaged in trial pulls in order to eliminate the weakest when one of our 6-inch shells fired by Fritz lobbed 35 yards from them in a muddy field, its forward burst, after cutting through a hedge, caught the lot, Killing 5 and frightfully wounding the other seven, including John Brown, who died during the day. The five were buried near Neuve Eglise Church, and John Brown at the C.C.S. along the Bailleul road.\n\nDuring this afternoon we received sudden orders to move to this camp – Vauxhall- The whole Bn. packed up and\n\nwas on the march within an hour. A big battle has been in progress down South for a few days and we are now ready to start at half-an-hours notice anywhere.\n\n23rd. – No leave for anyone. Still ready to move anywhere immediately. Serious reports reach us from the 5th Army Front. A most exciting Rugby March took place today – the final for the 4th Bde cup – between the","328":" and","329":" Bn. We won. The officers shouted champagne \nto\n and two barrels of beer to themselves and the team – also to the Soccer team – on honor of the victory. Two cups this week, Soccer and Rugby. It is a Bn. custom for the officers to fill the cup won for each player with champagne. \n\nFritz has been shelling Bailleul all this week and is still at it. Received photos of my wife and \"Kiddies\" today. Read several 1917 N.S.W. Educational Gazettes. They are much more interesting over here then they seemed in N.S.W.\n\n25th March – Reveille at 4 this morning at Vauxhall Camp in Belgium. Tonight we are down between Arras and Doullens about 70 miles from Vauxhall. Embussing between Neuve Eglise and the Belgium border we hurriedly passed through Steenwerke, Merville, Lillers, and St Pol and debussed at La Herliere on the Arras-Doullens road. The 4th Bde remained near here, the \n12th\n rest of the 4th Division going farther down near to Albert and Dernancourt. St Pol has been badly knocked about by bombs. This place was shelled slightly last night. There are remnants of many \"Tommy\" battalions near here some without any idea of where they are or to where they should report and knowing nothing except that \"Jerry is coming strong\". It was a wonderful piece of work moving the whole Australian Corps from over 70 to up to 100 miles in a day. This morning we were part of Plumer’s Army; now, I think we belong to Byng or Rawlinson. The remnants of the","330":" Army have been passing back all this evening. I can hear them still trudging along. The people of Steenwerke were out in their\n\npicturesque narrow streets to wave us along. Many a digger knew a friend here, and as a recognition took place there were delighted exclamations and waves on both sides. \"Au revoir, bon sante, monsiuer!\" \"Bon retour!\", Bon fortune!\" were heard repeatedly. I heard one digger \"Au revoir Mam’selle Yvonne, me retourner toute suite!\" Whether he will or not?\n\nPassing through Barly, as far as I could see in every direction there were columns of motor lorries spinning southwards in long columns of dust. We were all a dusty lot. Here I saw several families unloading their furniture. Thinking they were evacues from the Bapaume area I asked an old monsiuer and his wife whey they were stopping here instead of going back farther and so making sure of being safe. \"Au monsiuer, vous etes Australiens, tres bon soldats, vous les tiendrez!\" he replied, and Madame and the children repeated \"Les Australiens tres bon soldats!\" as they proceeded \nto\n on with the carrying \nof\n back their furniture. They were all\n\nunloading the furniture they had not finished loading. The same think we found going on at the neat village of Bavincourt. And the Australians had never been in this area before.\n","331":" 10.am – Last night was very disturbed by rumors of all kinds, the Germans were nearly to Paris, they were driving back Plumer’s Army as they had done the","332":" Army, they were almost against us here with cavalry out and hundreds of tanks,. We were up early this morning ready to move at the shortest notice. Everything that cannot be carried easily on the person has been packed up and taken to the Q.M. to look after. The Tommies are still coming back and substantiating the rumors of German tanks. We have been discussing how we shall deal with them. The best we can arrive at is that we shall pour rifle and Lewis Gun fire into them especially at any crack or opening, There are several burning villages between us and Bapaume. We have just received orders to move forward. (The next entries will be on rough sheets of paper)\n","333":" – 6 pm. Lying out on a ridge west of Hebuterne We have marked out a trench system to hold on in case of an enemy attack. We have no artillery to supporters us. We are to attack and recapture Hebuterne at daybreak tomorrow morning. Coming up here today we passed hundreds of the 5tth Army retiring. I saw nine staff officers, including two generals, on a car with seating accommodation for three. They were all over it and retiring. No wonder the Tommies feel that they are beaten. Some of our men made very sarcastic remarks as they passed, such as \"Don’t you know there’s a war on?\" \"You’re going the wrong way if you’re looking for Fritz.\" Several officers assured us that Hebuterne was in enemy hands, but our Brig – General Brand – didn’t believe them, and rode into and through the town without seeing a German. \nThey\n He hurried back and has ordered us to move straight in.\n","334":" - 11 In Bn. Hqrs. in a cellar under a shattered\n\nhouse in Hebuterne. Lucky Brig! Yesterday when he rode through here, it so happened that the advanced German party of about 17 was here, but they were either \"windy\" or drunk. There were also two Welsh officers drunk in the town. We struck a very warm time coming in and clearing up the town. Lt H.B. Brown (D.C.M., M.M.) was given charge of the advanced party of the Bn. when we reached the village we came under enemy rifle and machine gun fire, and an exciting and interesting evening followed. Unfortunately we lost some splendid men; Lieut Nolan was severely wounded in the thigh and soon died; Lieut Mallee Jones was wounded nicely in the upper arm; and many others fell or kept the M.O. busy attending to their wounds. The cemetery is still in enemy hands. In searching for any hidden Bosche in the dark last night a man stumbled into a deep stinking well. We rushed\n\nassistance, but couldn’t reach him. One strong man call out \"Catch me by the feet and hold me down\" Two grabbed hold of each foot, and others hold of them, and the four lowered him by his feet head first into the well. Luckily he was just long enough for the freezing drowning man to seize. The strain on the volunteer human rope must have been tremendous for we felt it hanging on to his legs. The sides of the well were also falling in, which accounted perhaps for its being unused and so foul. We hurried the saved man back to the doctor as he was in a very bad way.\n\nWe shall not be short of rations here as in addition to the inhabitants leaving pigs, rabbits, poultry vegetables and household groceries behind them we have found a well stocked French Ordnance, containing\n\nover a ton each of rice, peas, macaroni & flour as well as plenty of coffee, vermicelli and beans. There were also thousands of singlets, pairs of boots (French military) and hundreds of French military overcoats and caps. All the diggers except those in the trenches \nwill slept\n are sleeping warm and comfortable \ntomorrow\n today in French overcoats and on French blankets. We were lucky \nto have\n in discovering this ordnance last night for Fritz has lobbed several shells in \ntoday\n already this morning.\n\nThis morning a French civilian was reported to be in town, As it was necessary to make sure there were no spies I received orders to find out all about him and to tell him he would have to leave the town. Here he was in his poor old home, right near our front line. His wife and daughter left yesterday\n\nleft with\nas the first Bosches came in sight, dragging and pushing a handcart loaded with some of their belongings. I remember seeing them, - a mattress, a few blankets, clock, two chairs, some kitchen utensils, a small safe, two wooden tubs all tied on to a small hand cart like those Australian boys love to play with, the mother pulling, the daughter pushing, both dressed in their Sunday best. In addition to pushing, the daughter led a cow. I shall never forget them and others hurrying along the road to Bienvillers mixed up with Tommies, Taffies, and Jocks. The old man had remained to look after a pig and the house. There he was tying up a few articles and carrying them up into the attic, and a few Bosche shells \nflying over\n screaming over into the centre of the town. It was hard to get him into conversation but then he understood he had to leave at once,\n\nhis eyes welled up and a tear dropped down each cheek as he replied – \"Ah, monsieur, my beautiful things – pointing to a bedstead and mattress, and a few chairs, - my chickens and my pig!\" A couple of diggers escorted him back towards Foncquevillers, each carrying something for him. What he will do when they leave him, goodness knows. Just before he left, one wall of his house was blown down and three fowls killed. This morning we set several dozen rabbits free, but they ran to us to be nursed and fed and some climbed on to a sofa to sleep. There are many canaries too that will not take their offered liberty. I can hear some diggers catching fowls, and some pigs being killed by our cooks. We may as well eat the, as have them starve or wait for a German shell, for soon this town will be no longer a town; these\n\nhomely homes, homes no longer.\n\nLater – Have just seen Captain Mosely carried out, wounded by a bullet from an seroplane. I am to go up and take his Company in the line – \n","335":" 6 pm. Standing to as the Bosche are massing in some sheltered ground in front of us. We have no artillery to speak of to deal with them, while they are pouring ours into us and have been doing so all day. Every now and again a few of them attempt to rush over into a trench about 100 yards in our front. We ourselves cannot get to it as the space between us and it is enfiladed by enemy machine guns from the cemetery. Our Lewis gunners are splendidly active and are giving these rushing parties a rough time. My C.S.M. Tennant – \"Lofty\" – a splendidly fine and very popular C.S.M. is gone, also three of my signallers. I have had twenty casualties already. Have just received a note from Hqrs that\n\nGerman officers are reported to be in British uniforms giving orders to the Tommies to retire. Have informed the company that on no account whatsoever will we retire and that anyone giving such an order is to be shot at once. Everyone seemed pleased to receive this notice as there had been several rumors of our flanks falling back and that we too should have to retire to conform to them. Our men like something definite. Have just reported back that there is considerable enemy movement in the dead ground in front and that this ground is covered with a smoke barrage. Everyone expectant. Twilight but rather dark. My officers are Lts. H.B. Brown, B. Rose, and \"Ben\" Hall, three of the best. Severe sniping from the cemetery. My telephone communications is again broken – the third time this evening – by shell fire. The linesmen are having a rough time. Have just received a message from the Colonel, through Lt. Cleland, to advance \nand\n capture and consolidate the trench in front, and so\n\n with Capt McKillop and \"C\" Coy who are to clean up the cemetery.\n","336":" – In front line at Hebuterne. Today was the most trying I have ever experienced. The oldest men in the company say it is their worst experience. We advanced last night from 70 to 100 yards and consolidated the new trench. There was not a moments rest last night, and then first thing this morning, before daybreak, he commenced shelling us heavily with our own howitzer – and 18-pounder shells. For nine hours he poured them into us with the range to a T. We have not a single dugout and so can only crouch down in the muddy trench. Raining all day, cold and miserable. Men are begging for cigarettes, \nbut they\n they have shared all they had with others. I have tried to keep them apart in order to minimise casualties but they like being in company and soon got together again in twos and threes. \"C\" Coy successfully cleared\n","337":" – Hebuterne – 4 am. Have just received a message that Fritz is massing on our front.\n","338":" am – Nothing doing. I think Fritz is too wise to try us again after the few knocks he has had from us. He was quite cheeky the first two days and came over the hill and across the valley in big \"lumps\", but after our machine guns got on to them a few times they changed their tactics. Sergeant Dwyer, our","339":" Bde V.C. gunner wiped out 30 of them in a bunch.\n\nTwo of my \nfriends have\n officer friends have gone west. Lieut Nolan, a young solicitor of Sydney, who was in the University Scouts – a first class footballer and a splendid chap altogether, - and Lt. \"Bill\" Simpson. \"Bill\" Simpson caught it yesterday escorting some Tommy officers who were suspected of being spies – quite wrongly – when the stretcher bearers came to him he tried to drive them away telling them they couldn’t save him and were only endangering themselves trying to bind him up to carry him away under heavy shelling. but our stretcher bearers go through anything and got him to the R.A.H. He went out soon after however.\n\nthe cemetery. During today the officers saw each man’s feet. They were then rubbed and powdered with talc powder and new socks put on. This inspection, rubbing and powdering was going on all day as only a few were allowed to have their boots off at a time. There is not an inch of this trench that is not knee deep in mud.\n\nEntry","340":" – In Catacombs in Hebuterne. These catacombs are about 200 feet deep and big enough to hold a Battalion. They were formed by the French digging shafts down, and then tunnelling out in order to get clay to make clay pipes, a product of Hebuterne. We came in here the night before last and are to go back into the line again tonight. Since my last entry we have had some rough times. After capturing the cemetery \"C\" Coy and the","341":" Bn. raided Fritz and captured 70 prisoners and several machine guns\n\nThen the New Zealanders on our Brigade Right made a splendid hit by capturing 250 prisoners and 100 machine guns, and blotting out an advance by twelve waves of Bosches. The enemy advance in this direction has definitely ended. On 29th March I was ordered to advance a platoon about 300 yards to occupy a trench near Fork Roads. Fritz used to have a machine gun, snipers and a flare King there each night previously. The order reached me at 3 pm. and the platoon was there in position by 3.30. This was specially quick as the majority of the platoon were enjoying their first sleep for a few days. We had found some old dugouts, cleaned them out, and occupied them that morning. Constant patrolling has been necessary all along. My patrol leader is Cpt. Massie about the smallest man in the battalion. He conducted three patrols each night and always found out something\n\nvaluable, He is splendid , as also are his scouts, Treharne, Rawdon, Coady and Howard. Cpls. Diaon and Miller are amongst the killed out there; the former was on his Lewis Gun, the latter heading a raiding party against a German machine gun about 400 yards out from our advanced post. In this raid at 2 a.m. on","342":" we smashed a German machine gun but lost Miller killed and Rawdon wounded. Our next raid was in cooperation with \"C\" Coy when we raided another machine gun post at 5.30 am on","343":" Lt H.B. Brown led my party and Lt. Parsonage \"C\" Coy’s party. They captured the gun and \n the gunner\n the remaining gunner. In this raid we were assisted by our Stokes Trench Mortars under Lt. Les Waterford, who gave the post a preliminary \"hurry up\" of 50 shells. This brought on a terrific enemy barrage which lasted 9 ½ hours, during which we were shelled with flying pigs, 8 inch shells,\n\nfine-nines, four-twos and our own 18-pounders. I got the company down below except for three sentries and so had no casualties. During the bombardments Fritz raided a \"D\" Coy post and captured it. A \"Tommy\" machine gun crew saw them coming to this post, but did not fire, as they were, so they explained later, an S.O.S. gun, and firing at these Huns would have been beyond their duty. As the Fritz prisoner passed the Stokes mortars which had staffed his post he pointed to them and exclaimed \"No bon Cannon! No bon Cannon!\"\n\nLast night, after we had had 14 days in the front line, \"A\" Coy, under Lt George Marfer, relieved us. They had been carrying to the three line companies while we were in. As soon as we arrived in these catacombs every man washed his feet in warm water and Condy’s, powered them, and changed his socks. There are about 100 Tommies here with us all suffering frightfully from trench feet, They have a padre attending to them. Their feet are in a terrible state, and they have been\n\nstarving. After watching our men eat their first hot meal in here they waited near the scrap tin to pick up what they could. They also collected scraps of biscuits to eat. We were astonished at their ravenous condition, and immediately every one shared what he had with them. They had evidently been \"lost\" \nevidently\n by their officers and headquarters, for no one had brought them anything for a week, not even an order, and they didn’t know where their headquarters were. Many of them will certainly lose their feet. After eating what we gave them they waited by, and eagerly seized our dixies to clean up any gravy left, And not a complaint from them. Their padre is splendid, washing and tending their feet personally after carrying down wood and water, but for a body of men I never saw a less initiative lot, or a more cheerless lot, in my life. Our men are weary, but they are yarning\n\nand smoking and singing to a mouth organ, while these poor chaps simply stand around waiting for someone to tell them to do something\n\n.We hear that over 70 percent of a Tommy Bn. on our left were evacuated with trench feet within a week. It is certainly negligence and inefficiency on their officers’ part, for in our whole Brigade we have not had a single evacuation with trench feet in twice the time. It seems boastful for an Australian to write this, but I feel far from boastful. I feel proud to belong to an efficient brigade, and a \"boiling over\" when I think that these \"Tommies\" who should be much the same as ourselves, are so utterly devoid of self reliance & selfaction.\n\nI have received the following cutting from a Paris newspaper: - I learn that \nby\n the recommendation for my Military Cross for work here has gone past Division – \n\nExtract form a French Newspaper.\n\nThe Australians have covered themselves with Glory\n\nAt ALBERT, the battle was still more terrible. Our positions were defended by Australian troops, who had to struggle against an enemy four or five times more numerous. The order was to give no ground; none did they give. Machine Gunners were killed at their guns; others avenged them for thousands of dead Germans littered the ground after the battle. The Australians covered themselves with glory, and, in an order of the day, one of their Chiefs was able to say to them:\n\n \"What our troops have done this week assures to our children the right to be proud to call themselves Australians, for never in the history of our army have our soldiers shown proof of valour and of military science in a higher degree than today. If there is nothing else, that alone would be sufficient for the glory of Australians.\n","344":" In hut at Cogneux in reserve. Last night after two days more in the front line, we were relieved by the","345":" Bn. of the 13th Rifle Brigade – 13th Bn, relieved by 13th Bn. of 13 Rifle Bde on 13th April!! One of my men had stolen some rum and was so drunk that I had to leave him behind with those Tommies until this morning. It was very dark coming out, and the track was full of shell holes; hence our march was slow. At Sailly-au-Bois we received hot tea, and on reaching here, hot stew. Four men broke down before they had come three miles out. They were weak after three weeks in the trenches and their feet too tender for marching. They had not mentioned feeling weak or tired but simply collapsed.\n\nWhile in Hebuterne we received a note from the British Divisional Commander stating that he was keeping us there so long as he has no other troops he could trust with the defence of that important village. His letter\n\nI understand, is now among our official records.\n","346":" At Cogneaux. We received 12 reinforcements today. They were originally meant for the 56th Bn. I tested them in musketry and found them up to the average standard and are a good class indeed. We are now in the 42nd Division. During the past three weeks we have belonged to four divisions, our own 4th Australians, the","347":" 37th and 42nd – Handed over from one to the other like trench stores – After we had helped ourselves to supplies we wanted for the front line, eg bombs (which were so very slow in coming up to use after we requisitioned them that we sent our limbers and helped ourselves from a dump) a British Staff Officer said \"You Australians are indeed stout folk, but, like Leeds merchants, socially impossible\" Another objected to my calling them \"Tommy Officers\" because it seemed to imply that they \"rose from the ranks\". He was a Scottish officer in a London regiment. He also objected – in a friendly way – to being called\n\nan English or Imperial Officer, but liked \"British\". It is very \nmuch\n common to hear the term \"Tommy\" or \"Jock\" officer which are certainly more definite than the Imperial or British. Read \"Bulletins\" of 8th Decr 1917., censored 150 letters, wrote long letters home.\n","348":" The Bn. moved forward again today to Sailly-au-Bois to be in close reserve. I am here at Cogneaux with the 33 1\/3 percent of the Bn (generally left out) conducting a Bombing School. Our A.S.C. and Transport all have good horses and mules again, having got rid of their \"smokes\" to the Tommies, and taken in exchange, when no one was looking, decent animals. We lost a great many horses last month near Helbusterne. An English major said to Capt Walsh (of the A.A.S.C.) \"I suppose we shall lose a few horses with you chaps amongst us, but its worth it.\"\n\n22ND April – Chez Souve at Coisy near Amiens, where I was billeted in","349":" Leaving Cogneaux this morning with 5 signallers on bikes we passed through St Leger, Authie, Marieux, Puckevillers, Rubempre, Pierregot and Raineville.The old people here made me extremely welcome. Madame found a few stiches loose in my coat and sewed them up, made me coffee and omelette and invited me to stay as long as I could with them. There is a big movement of French troops up the way and farther north from the South. I passed several French regiments today. This evening, at 5, a fine \nof\nbattalion of \nC\n the","350":" Chasseurs Aplins arrived here, marching into the town with bayonets fixed, flags flying, two bands playing, and to a step of 160 to the minute – quick short steps, and with full packets, - heavier, I believe than our own. It was a very inspiring night, especially as they had just completed a 22 kilometre march. they had just come from Italy. The officers\n\nhad their mess here, and insisted on my joining them, although, \nthey\n until they had questioned the family about me, they were suspicious of my being a spy. They had never seen an Australian before. They are the essence of politeness towards me and to each other. For mess we had rice in hot milk, horse steak, green peas, conserve and cheese. They also toasted Australia and myself in Champagne. I responded as gallantly as I could. Enemy planes are over dropping bombs on a railway near here. \n","351":" – In the Bois de Mai against Allonville. The Battalion are bivouacked here as every billet \nabout\n in this area is already overcrowded. Last night the Bosche dropped several bombs in this wood in attempting evidently to hit the hangars nearby. The Bn. arrived at Raineville in ‘buses and marched on here this evening. This wood will be especially beautiful in a few weeks’ time as it is now out in bud – white and pink mainly – while wild violets and jonquils cover the ground that is free from blackberries.\n","352":" – Germans took Villers Bretonneaux today. Reported that they used tanks\n\n25th April – At Allonville. Anzac Day – Brigade Canteen had a good stock of beers in, Bass, Tennants, and Allsop’s – and so the troops celebrated cheerily.\n\nA Memorial Service was held this morning by Padre Hinesby in the Bois de Mai. Reported that our 13th. and 15th. Brigades have retaken Villers Bretonneux and 800 prisoners, and that they would have advanced farther had the","353":" Division been able to advance with them. Here the Germans used Tanks.\n","354":" Conducted Rifle Bombing with No 36 Mills’ Grenades which are very effective at about 220 yards. Went with a party of officers to our Brigade Pierrot Show in a hangar. A great crowd there and a good show. All the troupe’s stage properties have been lost, with a great deal; of officers gear. Before coming south from Belgium we made a Brigade dump at Meterem; but this was shelled early and then captured by the enemy.This evening we hear that we have lost Kemmel – rather a serious loss for it gives a view of Belgium from Ypres to Ostend, and almost to Dunkirk. I yarned this evening with the old madam at whose house I am billeted\n\nShe lived here in the same house during the 1870 war, and remembered the Germans being here then quite well being 10 at the time. The French here have a very poor opinion of the English troops on account of their rapid retreat. They compare them with the Portuguese. I got very annoyed at several French men making this comparison, and pointed out that while the","355":" Army was running 35 miles, the French army on their right ran 45 miles. Unfortunately some few of our men speak disparagingly of the Tommy retreat in conversation with the French. One never hears a Frenchman belittle any part of their army.\n\nWent for a long walk with a padre this evening. I have during my time over here been particularly struck with the absence of sectarianism in the army. All the men are brothers to each other in the true sense of the word, and our chaplains on the whole aim at placing Christianity instead of\n\nchurch religion before us. Men of any or no denomination have plenty of time for what they consider to be a \"dinkum\" padre, no matter what church he represents.\n","356":" At Daours\n\nRode from Allonville with 5 Signallers to Daours as billeting Officer. Daours is a very pretty village with two beautiful chateaux. The whole town has been looted or turned inside out by people hurriedly grabbing what they could before they evacuated. The looting was done before we arrived. I have not yet seen one of our chaps, or any Australian loot. We have made ourselves comfortable in places being smashed to pieces by shell fire, and there lived on pigs, fowls and rabbits that would otherwise have died, and we have souvenired a great deal, but if a thing could be saved for the owners who might return after the war, the Australians always did their best to place it as safe as possible.\n\nThe Bn. marched from Allonville through Querrieu and Pont Noyelles and reached here about 3 pm.\n\nIn Amiens at present are two dead Frenchmen lying in the street with a notice on them which reads \"Shot for Looting. Beware.\" They were civilians from Boulogne who had hurried down to Amiens when they heard of the exodus from the latter place. The French soldiers who caught them in a shop asked no questions, but shot them on the spot, and then placarded them.\n","357":" – In Villers Bretonneux. This morning at Daours I detonated No. 23 and No. 34 bombs – Mills and Eggs – for the bombers \ngoing\n coming into the line at Villers Bretonneux. This evening the Bn. \nleft\n moved out from Daours in Companies at 10 minutes’ interval. Tea was ready for them at Fouilloy. Westwood and myself walked up, having a quiet trip. The town and woods nearby are saturated with gas. In this Chateau in which we have our Headquarters it was very heavy, and is still bad in some rooms. Having been used as a R.A.P. \nit\n the place soon became so bad with gas off men’s clothes that all the Headquarter officers of the Battalion before last in here had to be evacuated gassed. \nA\n I am now Bn. Gas Officer and so have the job of clearing the Chateau. A great deal of gassed bedding and clothes are still to be removed. It is a nasty job as the disturbing of them releases gas. The night is quiet except for snipers and machine guns. \n\nLater. Have just returned from visiting our Outposts and Support Line with the C.O. – Colonel Marks.\n","358":" – Villers Bretonneux- The Adjutant, Capt. Davis and myself explored the town generally and found several rooms full of gas. I opened doors and windows of these rooms. I put up several danger notices on the badly gassed rooms and cellars, but they were useless, for whenever a digger sees one of them such as \"Keep Out. Dangerous.\" or \"Gas in Here!\" he thinks that someone has a plant of champagne there and has put up the notice to scare others away.\n\nThat the people had left hurriedly was evident from the fact that dinners were left on the ovens, dishes of potatoes, half pealed, some clothes in the wash, wardrobe and small personal effects in many cases left behind and many other things pointing to the fact that many had made up their minds & gone on the spur of the moment. There were\n\ndozens of rabbits, canaries, cats and pigeons dead with gas from which every place fairly reeked. The gas appeared to me to be mainly phosgene and diphosgene. Apparently many wealthy people of Amiens lived here. We are on a hill surrounded by valleys and looking down on the picturesque Somme, \nand\n Ancre, and Avoe, with the beautiful ancient towers of Corbic Church, and spires of Aubigny and Daours, towards the north & north west all surrounded by clumps of green trees; the Bois l’Abbe and Bois de Hangard, to the South and South-west, and the saperb Cathedral of Amiens in the midst of the city and accompanied by dozens of smaller spires almost at our feet to the west. It is a truly inspiring sight to stand near the farthest point of the German advance on the hill north west of Villers Breton-neux and to gaze at Amiens, the Somme &\n\nand its tributaries. I wish I were a word artist. What a contrast to the view we get from the roof of our chateau towards the east where every village we can see is in ruins. There are Germans moving about in and near all the villages, clouds of dust and smoke from our shells often causing them to scatter or hasten, a German transport column down near Marcelcove which our Artillery observers must also see while we are watching them, for we observe a hundred shell bursts in and around them, a single horseman gallops away. An enemy balloon is up over Warfusee-Abancourt; their air squadrons travel North and South from Bray down towards Rosieres – always well on their side of the lines. Our ‘planes have crossed over, there is sharp rattling of machine guns, there is a German\n\ndoing a spiral nose dive, no, he is falling, he has crashed. Our ‘planes are surrounded by an \"Archie\" barrage, but all get back safely and within a few minutes are soaring over our heads as if they has done nothing. There they cross again. No, it is another one of our squadrons that has suddenly appeared from behind a white cloud very high up. How they swoop down on the surprised enemy! Another Fritz falls with a streak of fire and smoke shooting from his tail, and our planes are back with us again, machine gunning the German trenches as they cross. The enemy ‘planes are over every night lately, but daylight keeps them to their own side. The Tommies who assisted in the \"mopping up\" of Villers Bretonneux, must have had a rough time. This\n\nmorning I saw what I took to be a platoon of Tommies resting in a sunken road at the north of the town. Some were sitting on their packs, some lying down against the bank, two across the centre of the track, one about ten yards way from the rest, many gripping their rifles – thirty altogether – but all dead. They must have been caught resting in this sunken road by German machine gunners \nfire\nin that clump of bushes about 200 yards away near the Crucifix. One had almost got away. In the cellars we find gruesome sights, in one three big Germans with empty bottles around them, all too drunk to notice the gas that changed their drunken sleep into a permanent one. The gas has turned them black. In another a struggle has taken place between Tommies and Germans. Another shows us a more pleasant side, a wounded\n\nTommy and a few Germans living together on chipped potatoes in a cellar, the Germans tending to him until they are found several days after the recapture of the town.\n\nAcross a\ncorner\n road at the east end of the town there is a barricade of furniture fastened together and intertwined with a hundred strands of barbed wire. The Germans had carried out from neighbouring houses, shops and factories, all kinds of furniture – three pianos, an organ, several sewing machines, suites of furniture, book shelves, beds, tables, sideboards, boxes, \netc\n anything at all they could lay hands on – for this barricade. And it was of no value to them for the","359":" and 13th Brigades of our 4th Division got to the rear of it by their splendid encircling movement\n\nThis \nevening\n morning we got a prisoner who was a great coward. We wanted him, as we had been ordered to get \nidentification\n a prisoner for our Intelligence Staff, or he would have been killed, as he lay down, squealed, and refused to move in front of his escort, thinking, evidently, that they would shoot him in the back. After a lot of trouble and squealing, they made him march in front, but he kept looking back in terror. I suppose he has played this game himself with prisoners\n\n2nd May – 4 am. In \"D\" Coy Hqrs in a cellar on the Eastern outskirts of Villers-Bretonneux. In close support to the outpost line. The O.C. of this company, Capt \"Doss\" Wallack M.C., was killed here yesterday afternoon, and two of his officers, Lts G.J. Smith and Joe Watson severely wounded – all by one shell. Lt. Smith has 37 wounds from it and at least 4 of them look \ned\n very serious to me. I was sent up to take the Company temporarily. At 9 p.m. we were heavily shelled with gas for 15 minutes. It hung about for a considerable time. We sealed our cellar up as hermetically as possible and put out candles \nto\n in order to conserve the oxygen for ourselves, but the blanket door was forced open three times by gas shell bursts close against it. I ordered the company to remain as still as possible with their masks on, as movement causes deeper breathing and a greater likelihood of breathing in gas.\n\nFritz has been very jumpy all night, shelling us constantly, with spasmodic bursts of much heavier shelling with all kinds of stuff – shrapnel, gas, delayed action, and instantaneous fuse, shells. We have lost heavily in officers lately, they have to move about constantly in this kind of warfare where we are always nibbling from Fritz and worrying him as much as possible. In addition to the above mentioned officers, Capt Bone M.C. has gone with his two feet shattered, (he will lose both legs), Russell-Jones is wounded, Lilley evacuated with trench fever, and Parsonage with gassed eyes.\n","360":" pm. Battalion Hqrs in Villers Bretonneux. Captain R McKillop relieved me as O\/C \"D\" this morning at 4.30. Just after the Bn advanced its front line very successfully about 300 yards, Capt. R. Henderson being in charge of A and B Companies in the street., Lt Menfield being in charge of \"B\" under him.\n\nUnfortunately Capt. Henderson was severely wounded by a Machine Gun bullet in the thigh. The bullet entered and remained in the femur, after breaking it. We have lost 3 captains in two days – three of the best in the A.I.F. – Bone, Wallack, Henderson – and 5 lieutenants. Have completed gas screens and doors in Bn Hqrs., R.A.P., and in all places where a few men get together to sleep. All the officers, signallers and runners on Hqrs. are suffering from gas, our voices are gone and our eyes raw and burning.\n","361":" = 4 am. In Villers Brettonneux – Bn Hqrs. I am officer on duty from 1 to 5, but as Capt Davis’s eyes are very bad I have been on since 9 last night. At 2 this morning the Bn. on our right – the 47th – advanced a little to straighten out a salient. Our 4th Australian Division has the post of honor on the extreme right of the British Army where we join the French. At\n\npresent Australians are holding the whole of the 4th Army front. Haig may not think much of us as soldiers from a disciplinary point of view – saluting, and above all feeling and showing the essential awe in the presence of higher ranks so necessary for a successful career as an N.C.O. or officer in the Tommy Army, - but he puts us where there is something critical to do. NCOs and officers brought up \nto\n in the atmosphere of this school can never get into the hearts of those under them. The Tommy is always uncomfortable in the presence of even a corporal of this school. There are a few Australian higher officers who believe in this attitude and who do their best to bring their commands into what they consider to be the correct state of mind. I call to mind an Australian General on Salisbury Plain who loved it. He visits his units of training with all the pomp and work awe-inspiring presence of a barbarian\n\nchieftain of old, followed, as he gallops across the training fields, at due respectful distance by a host of attendants, any one of whom he would expect to be as a worm into him if happened. When he visited, the men felt that their officers and NCOs were altogether different beings to what they had known them to be. Everyone is uncomfortable until he is gone, no one respects him or his advice, and yet outwardly he had seen that everybody had felt his presence, everybody had bowed to the wisdom of the ten or twelve words he had deigned to speak. And when he has departed, with a feeling of relief that real work can now be done instead of sham eyewash, all-officers, N.C.Os and men, - get back to their earnest, personal, and therefore pleasant, training in bomb throwing, grenade firing, bayonet fighting, wiring,\nand\n entrenching, gas-drill, musketry etc.\n\nI call to mind also a Salisbury Plains adjutant, to enter whose presence gave one the feeling of approaching the Communion Table for one’s first communion. Many French officers, with whom I have conversed lately have remarked that they have never, even in their own army, seen more true camaraderie \nthen\n between officers and other ranks than in the Australian Army. They seem very courteous towards their men the poilu generally most respectful towards his officers.\n\nTwo enemy planes were brought down near us yesterday – one in flames. At present I can hear our ‘planes bombing behind Fritz’s line most heavily. They have been at it all night in spite of the strings of flying onions and searchlights. It is a very dark night. Pte W. Coady (a teacher from Newtown) a splendid man, was killed by a snipers bullet through heart last night. Yesterday afternoon we\n\ncaptured a German message dog with a message about a German relief – a fine, large, smooth black dog. The note informs the German officers in the front line that the relief he has asked for cannot be given. We have a sniping 18-pounder near us, closer to the front line than I have yet seen one. Just out \nnear\n beyond our front line there are three large hangars belonging to an old British aerodrome. They hide a great deal of view from the outposts, and so we have made repeated trials to burn them down. Some of the efforts have been most dangerous and exciting for the enemy have them covered with machine guns and snipers, and they are constructed of almost uninflammable material. The enemy apparently have a dugout in the second one, for we see plenty of movement in and out of it.\n\nHave just seen an \n terrible \n example of fortitude that it would be hard to surpass. In our R.A.P. was a poor wounded Tommy, with a frightfully shattered and septic thigh. He had been wounded on the 23 the last month in the German attack on Villers Bretonneux and had lain out in a shell hole in the cold and wet for 10 days, before being found this evening by our patrol. They heard him trying to attract their attention in order to surrender, thinking they were Germans. When he found out that they were Australians he caught the sergeant by the neck and kissed him over and over again. He had eaten grass and drunk his own water on occasions, so he said but it seemed ages that he was lying there. He had heard patrols moving about for over a week but believing them to be Germans he had held out, until tonight when he could hold out no longer.\n\nThe poor chap’s leg is frightful and will have to come off immediately, but he will almost certainly die.\n","362":" – 6 am.

This Bn. has made two attempts \nlast night\n to get forward to line with use, but has failed. Machine gun fire was very severe. It has been a special feature on this front, always severe consistent and low, just skimming parapets. Raining all last night.\n","363":" 3 am – Villers Bretonneux – Have just received message that enemy has moved forward his field guns and that we are to bombard them tomorrow, with heavies at 10 am and with our field guns at noon. We were relieved tonight by 16th Bn. and are now in their old Support positions just at the rear of Villers Bretonneux. We are all either very husky or have lost our voices with gas, as the town still fairly reeks with it. Raining again tonight. The enemy, who all along has been quite active and offensive near the Hangars, rushed one of our\n\nLewis Gun posts near there on the night of 3rd\/4th May and Killed Sgt. Wolff, our popular boxer, \nof\n and \"D\" Coy Lewis Gun Sergeant.\n\nI am feeling very dirty and itchy and would give anything for a bath and change of clothing.\n\nYesterday at 6 pm our Corps Artillery bombarded Monument Wood for 10 minutes – a real \"hurry-up\" – during which they sent over 5000 shells – mainly gas shells. From our O.Pips. on roofs in Villers Bretonneux we had seen plenty of suspicious enemy movement there, but this \"hurry-up\" ought to have given them something to think about. Am feeling very sleepy. A heavy bombardment has been on all night up north towards Morlancourt and Albert.\n\n5th May – Evening – Villers Bretonneux has been an extremely beautiful village, but it makes one’s heart bleed to see it now. Our Headquarters until yesterday, were, until last month, a delightful home of a rich woollen manufacturer. His\n\nfactory next door was a large well equipped one. We saved what we could for the French Mission and sent back tons of wool, woollen Guernseys and valuable bits of machinery. We are still saving what we can for the people by putting clocks, ornaments and small pieces of furniture in cellars. This is being done spontaneously by many, as there have been no orders on the matter, except in connection with the salvaging of the wool and machinery. But every now and again a shell smashes into a piano, sideboard, room of glassware and ornaments stored away, library, nursery or conservatory. Our headquarters were in the basement of a 3-storey chateau and when the end wall was smashed in by half-a-dozen shells, it, the explosions and the falling roof, destroyed the main hall, staircase, library, parlor, bedroom and nursery with everything in them. Just the furniture and things one would love to have in his home – inlaid tables with unique carved legs\n\nmarble clocks, alabaster clocks and models, bronze and brass clocks with chimes, - some of every clock age, large mirrors of great beauty, children’s motor cars, dolls and other toys, vases and sets of great value, paintings and everything to make an ideal home. \nYesterday this\n One afternoon I came across five pianos and three motor cars smashed almost to smithereens. Three large woollen mills wrecked, and thousands of pounds worth of wool in skeins and bundles, - of every color, including Khaki that our women in Australia want so much – are lying everywhere, and it is the same with guernseys, scarfs and socks. The Germans must certainly be short of wool and cotton, for in both Hebuterne and Villers Bretonneux, all the dead Germans had their packs full of \ncotton and or wool\n either material.\n\nAm writing this sitting in the setting sun just at the N.West of Villers Bretonneux. We have just had the laugh of a lifetime. Anyone\n\nwould have laughed if they had seen our chaps at Villers-Bretonneux any afternoon lately. This afternoon I saw what appeared to be Frenchmen of great style coming along from the town with wonderfully-dressed demoiselles on their arms. Our chaps had found wardrobes in practically every house in the town and had adorned themselves. Many had simply changed dirty, chatty singlets for soft silk blouses, but these afternoon parties are a complete all-over change. Picture a stove pipe hat, so very shiny, high collar and tie, swallow-tail of frock coat, nicely creased trousers and a walking stick and bouquet and gloves, with a \"piece of fluff\" on its arm – large Parisian hat, low necked blouse (de’collete, I imagine) of any striking color, latest skirt, (or blouse and skirt in one), silk stockings and high heeled shoes (naturally of the largest size to be found), a feather boa, or set of furs\n\nand a beautifully colored parasol, with a few daubs of paint and powder. Picture many couples like this one, promenading the town into which a shell or a crash came spasmodically, and then coming home to tea in the trench or along a \nbank\n green bank. I would like my friends in Australia \nto\n just to have seen the French soldiers themselves when they first saw these new digger Frenchmen and demoiselles. Alone all to have seen their bewilderment \nwhen\n on the first occasion such a party approached their post at the western entrance to the town. They really believed they were in a land if miracles to see the style of Amiens or Paris transferred to the tumbling shattered streets of Villers Bretonneux. The sentry excitedly called up to his comrades and the group of eight stood speechless. Then a really ‘attractive’ \"demoiselle\" smiled and bowed to them \nand asked\n and asked the Corporal \"Voulez-vous promenader avec moi monsieur?\" \n\nThe voice gave the show away, but the Frenchmen entered into the spirit of the joke entirely, and gallantly offering their arms to the sweet creatures, they escorted them across a series of trenches and held their dainty skirts away from the barbed wire. And then to see the cavalier farewell by the poilus, as each \"Monsieur Deegaire\" retook his demoiselle, and led her home here. And to see the dainty demoiselles eating their stew so daintily from their dixies, and sipping their tea so nicely from their dixie-lids, showing the while plenty of stocking, silk petticoats, embroideries and \"undies\" of every delicacy! Oh!!\n\nIt makes out Support Line life like a series of Gipsy teas. Moreso when the piano (which a couple pushed along on a handcart yesterday and installed under a small tree) rattles out good dance music and a set of Lancers commences. Of course some of the\n\nladies must go and get wounded, and off they must be sent on sketches to the R.A.P., and from there on to the Dressing Station, field Ambulance and Casualty Clearing Stations, in the \"pretties\". There they have to lose at the C.C.S. where pyjamas are issued, and here may be seen dainty crepe de chines, silks and satins, mixed up with dirty bloodstained khaki. \n\nWe are in view of the Boche planes, and within reach even of their field guns, but our chaps won’t be dull, while they can make fun. Unfortunately the \"pretties\" have not been able to stop pieces of shells, and more than one good Aussi has already taken his \"pretties\" to his soldier’s grave, smiling at them as he went west. Who with a man’s spirit cold be away from such men?\n","364":" 2 am – Inspected Villers Switch Trench, north of Villers Bretonneux, this evening with Major Wells. Bought a box of chocolates for 11 francs and a case of Whisky for the company officers for 65 francs. Showering this evening, otherwise the day has been fine. Capt Davis, Cleland and Westwood are coughing a great deal with gas irritations. Our voices have quite gone. My own gas cough is frightfully irritating. A good deal of aerial activity all day on both sides.\n","365":" 12.30 am On duty in dugout N.W. of Villers Bretonneux. The dugout which is white chalk, commenced to fall in on us today. Tunnellers are now timbering it up. We stuffed the Bosche heavily this evening. Great deal of aerial activity yesterday afternoon; British, French 2 German ‘planes manoeuvring for hours. George Falkiner and myself visited Villers Bretonneux gardens this afternoon and picked lettuces, cabbages and spring onions for tea. Raining tonight. Col. Marks 2 Capt Davis have gone back to Transport Lines at Lamotte for a rest.\n","366":" - As Acting Intelligence Officer, I took 45th officers over our positions today, as they are taking over from us tomorrow. I also reconnoitred the new position we are to take over tomorrow in the Aubigny Switch, in the Bois l’Abbe, as a reserve. We are to take over from two companies of the 48th and one of the 45th. I walked with G. Falkiner three miles back to Blangy-Trouville and reconnoitred their positions also, but this was a Brigade mistake.\n","367":" In an upper room of the Chateau de Bois l’Abbe, Bn, Hqrs for the Aubigny Switch. The relief took place this evening. This home does not appeal to any of us as it is a splendid target and quite a shell of a building \nonly\n. In the Aubigny Line we are in touch with the 37th French Division (Zouaues) – rather a post of honor – the extreme right of the British Army in France. A digger remarked I hope we have not\n\nto do a \"Change Direction Left!\" The French and our men are very friendly, exchanging cigarettes, bread & cheese. Our men don’t like French cigarettes or tobacco. Their cookers don’t look nearly as shiny and clean as ours. They have plenty to eat on account of dozens of our horses being killed. We simply drag a dead horse off the road to bury him, but the Frenchmen come along and cut off the choicer pieces.\n\nThere are many Yanks about here, visiting different parts for experience. They are all of a splendid stamp – well built, intelligent and anxious to learn all they can. We have had a different times Yank officers attached to us for experience and with these here, I have met a great many. I have always heard that they were swelled-headed regarding themselves and the States, but I have yet to meet one of this class. All I have met – officers and men alike – have been most unassuming, eager to learn and anxious to let us know that they\n\nreally do appreciate the strenuous times the British have had and the work they have done. As bombing and Gas Officer I have had many conversations with their visiting officers and the remarks made by one of them to me up near Hollebeke may be taken as typical of their attitude. \"Look here, you chaps have been at this game a long time while we’ve been resting and I want you to tell me all about these things (bombs) just as if I know absolutely nothing about them or the war at all. They appeal to me and I think it’s a jolly good thing they’re on our side. They seem to be more serious \nand business like\n than the Diggers, and they posses a more winners-like air then we do.\n","368":" In Petit Chateau, Lamotte-Breliere, on the Somme. There is a 10-inch railway gun on the line through here. It shakes every house in the village when it fires. I arrived here yesterday to have a rest on account of my irritating gas-cough and stingy watery eyes. Practically all Hqrs officers, runners and batmen are suffering with coughs and sore eyes.\n\nOur violent coughing seems to split our heads and to tear our throats. I am also out in a itchy rash, caused perhaps by gas or by want of a change of clothes and a bath, as I have only changed my underclothes once in six weeks and had a sponge over twice in the same period. The Town Major here is an Australian, so we get as good billets as there are to get. Our Brigade Pierrots give us a concert each evening on the lawn in front of the chateau. Many of our men enjoy themselves punting on the Canal, or bombing fish with Mills’ bombs.\n\nLater – Our C.O returned to Aubigny Line this morning to prepare to go into the line again. I had a splendid bath today – big hot shower – and a change of clothes. My throat is still very irritating and I am continually coughing violently. Many others who were in Villers Bretonneux are the same. Last night I inhaled Fry’s Balsaam and Menthol vapour and tonight Balsaam only – Weather is delightful.

We shall all have dumplings now for a fortnight, and our stew will be thicker. Headquarters men live well as they still get leeks, onions, potatoes and flour in abundance through the town. The town still reeks of gas as he has been sending it over since were we in here a little over a week ago. The 4th Div. Pioneers are stationed in the town, their orders being to fortify it as thoroughly as possible, and if necessary, to defend it to the last. They have mines, barbed wire entanglements, tank traps and blind alleys commanded by machine guns everywhere. They all want Fritz to come. Colonel Murray V.C. who left us to take charge of the 4th Machine Gun Bn. is often up here on a push bike, with his coat off. He has Machine Gun posts through-out the Divisional front.\n","374":" Villers Bretonneux – 4 am.

Leaving here this evening, as I was bonded this morning and received 4 weeks convalescence which I am spending at Lockerbie in Dumfrieshire and Strathtay in Perthshire. the doctors, sisters and nurses here have been wonderfully kind, sympathetic and attentive right throughout my period here. These women are wonderful people, without doubt, to attend to us so well and cheerfully week in, week out as they have been doing for almost four years. And their hours are from 7 am to 8 pm for which the nurses receive £ 20 per annum. They scrub \n shine \n sweep and polish, carry meals, feed patients, wash up and even do men-orderlies’ work. It is a downright disgrace for them to be allowed, let alone asked, to work like they do for such ling hours for 8\/- a week.\n\nOur own Australian Red Cross representatives – Miss Harris, the Diggeress, - is very keen, cheerful and popular among all Australians here.

There are drays and \n lorries\n cars every day form someone to take patients out, there are teas, concerts, theatre parties, and visits arranged in galore. Even in the London ‘buses the poorest Londoners will insist on a wounded Australian taking his to her seat. During the past week I spent a few days near Redhill, Surry, with a dear old lady of 70, who delighted to have a few Australians with her at her delightful home. She insisted on our breakfasting in bed – being attended by an old nurse who was disappointed if she could not do something for us. Each morning, Mrs Alexander came into our room after breakfast with the morning papers, a dish of gooseberries or raspberries, shook hands with us, and asked us how we had slept, gave us her plans for the day and told us that when we came downstairs at 11 there would be glasses of milk for us in the library. She does the\n\nwhole thing in a most charming way, without any limelight at all. Others tell me of other English women doing the same. We all say from the bottom of our hearts \"God bless them\", for they are indeed sterling. and the Australian women in London are splendid too.\n\nEntry 24th July – At the Hawke, near Lockerbie, Dumfries, Scotland.\n","420":" – Returned to London, from Hastings.

No one fishes or shoots because the rights have been left to someone in Edinburgh who only visits here occasionally. Even we, Stewart Robertson’s guests, cannot fish or shop on his land or in his burnsior lochs because of his rental of these rights. It seems to me a national disgrace\n\nto have those fish and rabbits so plentiful here and not being caught when we know of the great food shortage in these islands. I learn that not a dozen people in the past three years have enjoyed the wonderfully beautiful view of Lock Derculich & Ferragon we had today. I mentioned to Mrs S Robertson that I felt it would do the townspeople of the cities a great deal of good to be able to enjoy rowing on, fishing in, or even viewing these streams and lochs; she replied that if they were allowed, the would leave papers and litter lying about, and would come to expect the privilege as a right.\n","435":" – With \"Edradynate\" I walked to Grandtully \nCastle\n Station and took train to Killiecrankie changing at Balinluig.

At No 1 Command Depot, Sutton Veny. This is a frightfully managed place, many officers doing nothing but drink, loaf and gamble and among the men are several big \"two-up\" schools going strong.\n\nDuring my Convalescence and Leave – 6 weeks – I spent a fortnight at The Hawke, Lockerbie with Col. and Mrs. Elliott–Lockhart. He is a retired Colonel from India and was a personal friend of Lord Roberts. He is confined to his room with chronic rheumatism, but his and his household’s warm welcome to us – another Australian and myself- and their endeavours to make us comfortable and at home as well as to give us an interesting time were quite successful.They had an old cook from the Shetlands, who generally spoke Gaelic, who used to make us specially generous dishes, too much for anyone but an Australian to eat. If we chanced to leave any she came to us in tears speaking Gaelic which we were told meant that she was very much hurt at our not eating the whole\n\nof the dish. After we understood how it hurt her we always obliged. for exercise we chopped about 5 tons of wood in the burn, and after dragging it up hill \nput\n stacked it away in their woodshed to the winter. We also shot rabbits and fished anywhere to the great scandal of some neighbours who owned the rabbits and fish. The colonel told us that we had broken all the game laws of the country, and that he could not understand Australians not realising the privacy of rivers flowing through private property.\n\nOur second fortnight was spent at Strathtay, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire. On the way up we stayed a day in Edinburgh. A beautiful journey through the Lowlands to Edinburgh, and \nthrough\n across the Forth and through Perthshire to Aberfeldy. From here we had views of Grandtully Castle, Tay River, Loch Tay, Scheekallion, and many hills covered with heather, as well as several rushing burns and delightful lochs.\n\nThe laird, Stewart-Robertson, or, as he was called – after his estate – \"Edradynate\" always wore kilts, but confessed he didn’t like the bagpipes. I walked through Killiecrankie Pass with him. Everyone near here seemed to be named Robertson. I met Robertson after Robertson and concluded that everyone must be a Robertson. One day during a walk on the hills I lost my way and after wandering about for a few hours I approached a small stone cottage where two young women were gardening. As they looked up I saluted and said to the nearer \"Will you kindly tell me the way, Miss Robertson, to Edradynate?\" She looked quite surprised but quickly recovered and replied \"Yes certainly, but how do you know my name in Miss Robertson?\" \"It is, isn’t it?\" I questioned, and I was right.\n","456":" No 1 Command Depot, Sutton Very – I am Field Officer for the Troup today. Early this morning I visited Warminister to inspect the meat to be issued in the Troup. A Medical Officer (Major) was with me. There is a very large military bakery here, where bread is made by machinery, girls working the factory mainly. The meat to be issued to the Australian Camps was of very good quality and condition, but that for the German prisoners was in my opinion quite unfit for human consumption, the mutton (Argentine) being tubercular and spotted all over, with white spots, and the horse legs looked thin, \n and\n tough and black. As I am no judge of raw horse flesh, I took the M.O.’s word that it was quite healthy although he would want to be stewing to tackle it himself. I mentioned my objection regarding the shop to the Chief Quartermaster, but he replied \"Well the poor b-------‘s must have something to eat and as their\n\nsubmarines are sinking our food we can’t give them good meat that is required for our own men who are already on very short rations. They will make jolly fine dishes out of that carcase and horse flesh.\" A horse to be killed for them must pretty well be \n at \n on its last legs too. I have heard yarns of these primers being over well-treated but if \n every \n this Tommy Quartermaster is typical of the others there is absolutely no truth in the yarns. \n Spent the \n Our own Australian Q.M. here at Sutton Very manages most creditably. The \nfood\n handling of the food is thoroughly clean and sanitary, the dishes are as appetising and varied as can be expected in any camp, and there is no water.

Arrived here late this evening after being in train all last night and today. Early this morning we passed through Amiens with its shattered station and streets. The parts of the city near the railway lines and station were very badly knocked about by shellfire and bombs. The people were returning each hour of \nthe\n each day. We saw many of them making back towards the city along the roads near the railway line, and in the city itself many were busy nailing up pieces of Hessian or sheets of iron over the shattered windows. Still they were a cheery lot. And poor Villers-Bretonneux!. In May last when I left it, it had a few walls and a room or two intact, but now it was just desolation. A few poilus were clearing a road for motor traffic.\n\nthrowing the fallen walls back on to the old footpaths or into shellholes. Our old Observation Post , in the attic of the chateau near the High School, was now no more than a heap of \nrubble\n smouldering rubble. The railway line from here on to Perrons was entirely new, as every rail of the old line had been broken and twisted by explosives. There must \n have been \n be millions of tons of old rails still lying about. Every chain of the line has also been ruined, and metal and broken sleepers were scattered far and wide. Our engineers had done wonderful work near and in Perrons in bridging the miles of swamps and canals. Into these, hundreds of broken trucks, carriages and limbers, cookers and motorlorries, had been hurriedly \n\nthrown by the Germans to prevent our capturing them. Perrone, \nand\n Chaulnes, Rosieres and all the villages nearby had suffered for the second time during the war. Since the German retreat of 1916-17 these towns had not been rebuilt, but many families had returned and put their homes together again in diners ways. These homes and the comfortable, healthy cottages built by Miss Morgan, daughter of the millionaire, to shelter the returning families, were all gone again, together with thousands of British Army Huts. Between Chaulnes and Villers Bretonneux there were tremendous dumps of German shells of all sizes, to prove that they had every intention of making a big push in this area, and that their retreat had been more hurried that they had wished.\n\nArriving at Perrone, we found that the Brigade had gone back to the Picquigny area for a rest, and that we should have to return the way we had come. The engine simply changed ends and back we started, not, however, before some of us visited the Rue de Kanga. At St Rock, a shattered suburban station of Amiens we detrained, and marched to 4th Divisional Details Camp here at Ailly-sur-Somme. After a long hunt for a bed I found a very comfortable one in a small attic room. It is so difficult to find a billet here on account of so many evacuees of Amiens and Villers-Bretonneux being housed here until their own homes are patched up sufficiently to receive them again. The","467":" Div. Canteen here has a good stock in, including plenty of bottled ale and stout. Lieut Goldstein of W. Australia\n\nis in charge. In a poor looking house, very poorly furnished, I was surprised this evening to see a little fat French girl about 16 just the usual kind of \nFrench\n demoiselle that we often see working in the field – wearing both the British and French Military Medals on her breast. Quite genuine too. She had received them for attending British wounded in Armentieres while the town was being shelled. She didn’t seem to value them any more than broaches and pretty ribbons, and her letters from the King and Plumer didn’t seem to appeal to her at all. I think she would value a pretty blouse to a few ribbons more.\n\nFor tea this evening each of us had a 4-egg omelette \nand\n chipped potatoes and a cup of chocolate. Have been in the same carriage all day with Major\n\n \n\nRichardson,","468":" Bn., Capt. \"Paddy\"Hayes,","469":" Bn., Lt. Merifield (Tommy Sawyer) 131th. Bn, and Lt Black, 115th.

I have done a good deal of riding around this area. From the hills towards Vignacourt, \nand \n St Vast and South of Picquigny, we get splendid views of the Somme Valley with its canal and barges, and thousands of marshy lakelets separated by peaty isthmuses and cut into by peaty capes and peninsulas. Across the river between La Chausee and St. Saveur, are the \n\nentrenched remains of an ancient Roman fortification, which commanded the road made by Julius Caesar from Amiens to Etaples along which his soldiers marched to conquer Britain. I have paid several visits to these steep mounds and deep trenched. this afternoon Capt \"Dick\" Swinburne any myself rode to Coisy – about 15 kilometres. – Along the road we obtained some fine views of Amiens Cathedral in the distance. At Coisy, my old friends, M. Sauve, his wife and mother gave us a hearty welcome and a big omelette and chips. We also called on friends at Poulainville where the Bn. is well known. Here in the estaminet where we were having coffee, we yarned with several Tommies and \n\n \n\nJocks who were eager to learn what we could tell them about Australia. One Jock asked us if we knew Donald McKenzie who went to Australia 15 years ago. He seemed surprised that we hadn’t met him for he was a chap that could sing a good song and was sure to become well-known. \"Where does he live?\" I asked. \"In Aussie,\" he replied. \"But where?\" \"Oh, in Brisbane or New Zealand or some other part of Sydney.\"\n\n We rode back briskly in the bright moonlight. We have commenced regular Ceremonial Guard – mounting each evening on the Town Square – la Grande Place. There is keen competition between the companies to turn out the best guard.\n\nand also between the","472":" and","473":" Bn. Every man is keen on being the cleanest and smartest man in his guard and it is generally most difficult for the second-in-command, Capt. R McKillop, to pick out the best one for leave to Amiens or Abbeville next day.\n\nPicquigny is an extremely interesting old town, with its Feudal Castle, and church dating back to the same time. Some of Edwards III’s soldiers \n passed \n attempted to pass through here just before Crecy. Henry V’s scouts also reached here before Azincourt, and Edward IV met \n the \n King Louis XI if France here in 1475, when they signed a Treaty and reopened commercial relations between France and England which had been broken during the Hundred Years’ War.","474":" – Visited Amiens & its cathedral\n","475":" – At Picquigny. Today, All-Saints’ Day was celebrated throughout France with special fervor and solemnity. The day, always a special one in their Church calender, has been set apart by France as a Manifestation Day, on which each year, the graves of her heroes, and those of her allies, are to be visited and honoured, not only by the citizens of France, but more especially by her children. We were specially honoured by being present today on such an occasion, - at the moment of the collapse of Turkey and Austria, and continued German defeats on the Western Front. Picardy is always beautiful in Autumn, but today’s bright sunshine made one feel more than ever that great love our\n\nallies have for it.\n\nThe","476":" Bn. with its band, headed the procession from the Grande Palace to the Military Cemetery. Our Westralian brothers were followed by practically all the children of the town, accompanied by their teachers, and loaded with bunches and garlands of flowers – roses of Picardy, dahlias and chrysanth-emums. The venerable doyen, citizens – men and women of all ages – and the youths next to be called up, with their tricolour, were near the children. Everyone wearing mourning showed how general had been France’s sufferings. the 13th. Bn. (the two Blues) with our band came out next. At the cemetery, our C.O., Major T. Wells M.C., represented the General. Here the scene and ceremony were most impressive. The two Battalions and civilians\n\nwere massed around the cemetery, the children inside.\n\nStirring speeches, - read in English later on by the Interpreter, - by the school master and doyen were followed by that never-to-be-forgotten scene, - the precession of the children with their flowers in and out along the lines of graves. Little mites barely able to toddle, ordinary school children and senior pupils, all properly and reverently Knelt and deposited their floral tokens over the sleeping heroes. Every man felt a tear welling and a lump rising and yet it was all so sweet and simple. We knew that the graves of our own \"cobbers\" were being honoured in a like manner at the same time in many other parts of France and Belgium, and that they would be so honoured throughout the years to come.\n\nReassembling on the Grande Place in front of \nthe\n l’Hotel de Ville, the National Anthems of both Nations terminated the celebration.\n\nThe addresses were as follows|: - \n\nM. Dangreville, Schoolmaster: - \"All Saints Day\" is consecrated to the memory of the dead in each family. We could not allow this day to pass without coming to pay respect to those who have so well deserved to be made part of the great French Family.\n\nTo appreciate the gigantic work accomplished by the heroes who here sleep their last sleep; to estimate the debt of gratitude we owe them, let us look back. In March, the German Armies, by a crushing offensive, threw back the allied army across our Department right to Villers-Bretonneux. There only, hastily – collected forces forbade them\n\na farther advance.\n\nWell then, the heroes sleeping here, and in the parish cemetery, are those who, by heavy sacrifice, stayed the invader. We saw them, these soldiers, during the long days, arriving here from the battlefields, covered with mud and blood, bruised, their eyes still filled with the vision of the horrible hell they had just left. Not a plaint came from their lips, stoics they had been in battle, stoics they remained, feeling death embracing them.\n\nI saw them dying of their frightful wounds \nin\n without uttering a work. It was a splendid death of a soldier giving his life, his most precious possession, without regrets, for the triumph of an ideal, the welfare of his country, and for civilisation against barbarism.\n\nNoble victims of Duty! your sacrifice has not\n\nbeen in vain; you have contributed towards final victory. For I call to you at the bottom of your graves and you hear it., \"VICTORY!\" It is coming quickly; the victorious banners of the Allies are chasing the treacherous enemy of our France, which will soon be free from his defilement.\n\nBritish Soldiers fallen on the soil of sweet France, you who \nhave come\n came to help us to save it, rest in peace! The inhabitants of Picquigny will not forget that it is to you \nthat\n they owe their freedom from invasion’s horrors; to you they owe the protection of their hearths. You will be the object of our veneration and we shall come each year to place flowers on your graves as a token of gratitude and admiration. – And you children who hear\n\nme, and you young men of the 1920 class, who have lived with us during those dark days, \nhow\n what a lesson in history is this scene for you! what a lesson in history is this scene for you! You see that heroes do not die, that the remembrance of their deeds lives forever. If one day the country calls you for its legitimate defence, don’t hesitate to give your life for it, for the best fate, and the most to be envied, is to die for one’s country.\n\nYoung pupils! when you pass by this cemetery, never forget the gratitude and respect you owe to the soldiers sleeping here; never enter this resting place to play; when near, uncover your heads, lower your voices, and remember, for as our great Victor Hugo said:\n\n\"Good is it for one’s Country to die:\n\nGood is it that ye mourners are neigh:\n\nGreat is their name on the record of Fame,\n\nGreat is their glory, devoid of all shame.\n\nAs a mother will mourn her offspring so dear\n\nSo their Country for them sheds many a tear.\n\nThen Glory to our Eternal France,\n\nAnd to those who thus her glory enhance!\n\nWho came to her rescue and fought with their might,\n\nWho gave up their all, and died for the Right;\n\nWhose names now are placed in the Temple on High,\n\nWho left us a pattern of how men should die\"\n\n(I thank Chaplain Harper of the 16th Bn. for this translation of Victor Hugo’s poem)\n\nReverend M. Moy, Doyen of Picquigny: - \n\n\"My General, Officers and Soldiers of the British Army, Ladies and Gentlemen: - It is necessary\n\nto live in the times that we are living in to see such a celebration.\n\nIt is one of the characteristics of this war to have shows to us the most unexpected things, the most glorious and the most consoling, but also, alas! the most sorrowful.\n\nMilitary authority, civil authority, religious authority all three raise in turn their voices in this patriotic manifestation to celebrate the courage and valor of the soldiers of all allied nations.\n\nIt is a pride and an honor to me to be entrusted today to utter this praise in the presence of the most valiant troops of the British Army.\n\nFor us, Ladies and Gentlemen, what historical memories are recalled to us by this patriotic manifestation? It will occupy place in the history if Picquigny, after that of August 1475, when\n\nKing Edward IV of England and Louis XI of France met at Picquigny to sign the treaty of peace which was in reality the recommencement of commercial relations with England after the Hundred Years’ War. The reunion today presents another character; it is to honor the heroes of the two nations who have fought together for over four years for Right, Justice and Liberty.\n\nTo those heroes we owe special gratitude. It is to them, it is to you, my General, to you, officers and soldiers of the British Army, above all to you Australian Soldiers, that we extend at this moment our most grateful and warmest thanks. You have saved for us our beautiful city of Amiens, with it superb Cathedral, one of the joys of the world. It is to you that we owe, we people of Picquigny,\n\nand of all this country, our not having been obliged to flee from our homes, to abandon our ancient historical relics, so interesting and so beloved. We shall never be able to do too much to you in witness of our gratitude.\n\nWe know your prowess, Australian Soldiers, we had here, for 12 days, one of your brilliant conquests, - the Bertha that bombarded Amiens. It told afterwards to Paris your glorious exploits; it now related them to London.\n\nThanks to you, valiant Liberators of our land of Picardy! we will never forget what the Australian troops are, who aided by American and French troops, wrested our darling country from the cruel talons of a barbarous and inhuman enemy! but in what condition, Great God!\n\nWe give greeting here to all the heroes who met their death on these dreadful battlefields, especially those buried in our cemeteries, and of whom we have the glorious guardianship.\n\nAh! Ladies and Gentlemen! On this All Saints’ Day and for the ceremony which brings us together, it seems to me that the heavens are halfopened, and that, even as did St John in the Apocalypse, our enchanted eyes look on those who were marked on the forehead servants of God, and who form one immense throng from all nations, tribes, peoples and tongues. They have fought the good fight, they will have the reward of valiant soldiers. For more than four years we have followed them striving: but for four\n\nmonths we have just followed breathless, enthusiastic, over the rough but glorious fields of victory, the irresistible push and continuous advance of all the allied soldiers. Forward Champions of Right, of Justice, of Liberty and of Christian Civilisation!. By the King Eternal, Sovereign Master of events, they form an immense army of all nations, tribes, peoples and tongues. \n\nFor there heroes who have fought, and those who are still fighting the good fight of a just and equitable God against the haughty hosts of the \"Old God\" of \"Kultur\" from beyond the Rhine, there are being prepared triumphant ovations, the joyous echoes of which will resound throughout the whole world.\n\nYes, on the day of the victorious Peace, the bright\n\ndawn of which is already breaking, we all, who have faith in \"Those who reign in the heavens,\" and \"who will restore all empires\", as said our great Bossnet , will thank the God of Armies for having given light to the leaders, courage to the soldiers, confidence and tenacity to all. We shall sound praises, with transports of gratitude and a patriotic pride, of all the heroes whose labor, blood or tears, have brought about deliverance. Our banners floating on high will not then carry crape, -- our glorious dead would not allow that.\n\nIn similar circumstances, Judas Maccabeus, the valiant champion of Jewish independence and of Jerusalem against the |Kings of Syria, on the morrow of a great victory, ordered that the\n\ndead should be buried, and that monuments should be raised over their graves in order to honor the bodies of \nthe\n soldiers who had fought valiantly.\n\nDoes not the same thought come to you at this moment, in confiding to the hands of your children \nin order to teach them courage\n the flowers they are going to place on the graves of the heroes who have given their lives for the independence of our dear native land and of the world? And it is the same thought which shall animate us also, when soon we shall be praying in our church for their souls. For, as said again Judas Maccabeus, \"It is \na\n holy and wholesome \nthought\n to pray for those who have died for their country.\"\n\nIn one of her prophetic visions, our blest Jeanne d’Arc said: - \"The French\n\nand English united will of greater things than have ever been done in Christianity.\" Well then, behold the prophecy of our Saint fulfilled. France and England untied have been able to rally round them, in the defence of a just and holy cause – the liberty of Nations against the most terrible of tyrannies - , the great peoples of the world. From their common efforts we see our enemies conquered, asking grace.\n\nStill another effort, Ladies and Gentlemen! – and it is being made at this moment. Then France entirely reconquered, valiant Belgium liberated, our enemies on the Rhine! Final Victory!\n","477":" Picquigny – There was a general \"surprise clean-up\" of the whole Corps Area today. For the past month ‘sand-baggers’ have been busy, and many men, including Frenchmen, are reported to have been sandbagged and robbed. So immediately after breakfast this morning, everyone \nwas marched\n except a few officers and other ranks with special permits to act as \na\n search parties, was marched out into the fields from where no one was allowed to leave. The search party them piquetted the roads and arrested all without proper leave passes. They also visited every French house – in some \ncases\n suspicious cases examining even the bedrooms – and arrested every British soldier found there. Several A.W.L. men \nfrom\n were found, and will have to account for themselves. One – a deserter – who resisted the search party was shot. There are some very strong \"furphies\" about these sandbaggers. One yarn is that\n\nthere are a hundred deserters, - Tommies, Jocks, Canadians and Diggers - in a tunnel near Corbie with machine guns and bombs. The last one we have had any definite information about being sandbagged is Lieut Forsyth of 4th Div. Machine Gunners, who is now in a critical condition in hospital.\n\nA French farmer told me this evening that he is sure the sandbaggers are mainly escaped German prisoners disguised in uniforms stolen from drunk or sandbagged men. The French people here speak in glowing terms of the gentlemanliness and the thoughtfulness of the Australians towards them.\n\nAs a preventative against the ‘flu’ we have started compulsory gargling with Condy’s solution twice a day. The company falls in with dixies and as each receives his issue from a bucket he gargles. One company does it by numbers. A digger remarked to me \"If it only had some sugar in it would beat the French Vin Rouge.\"\n\nWe have had rice in some form to other every day lately. The Signallers sent in a letter to the Bn. Journal asking if they could not have it in their tea also, - stating the as they had it in everything else they felt lonely without it in their tea.\n","478":" A Lovely morning - quite a warm sun. Lectured at the Y.M.C.A. hall on Jeanne d’Arc. We are to move forward within a few days. Reported we are to make a big push.\n","479":" Mostly drizzly day. Going to be with the flu – \n","480":" Armistace Evening. Piccquigny. No wine or champagne left in the tow. No parades, except for a guard, today. As soon as the news same through all. soldiers and civilians, - assembled on the Square to hear the \"dinkum oil\" from the Brigadier, Gen Drake-Bockman. I saw tears \nof\n in the eyes of many hardy diggers. Officers and men, soldiers and civilians, all shook hands with those nearest them. There was no noise – but the general \nall round\n feeling of relief that the slaughter was over, and the feeling that Australia was at last near, could be felt. Many a man came up to an officer or N.C.O. he had been in many a fight with, and spontaneously they seized hands and wrung warmly without a word.\n\nThe bands played the National Anthems. Why can’t we have a National Anthem \nlike the French have\n top inspire us on these occasions, like the French anthem does them, instead of merely a personal one? Surely the British Nation, with its \nglorious\n unsurpassedly glorious history, ought to have a truly NATIONal Anthem. I have the very highest admiration indeed for our King, and, apart from being one of his truly loyal officers, & glory, as a British subject, in which he represents, but \"God save our King and make him victorious, happy & glorious and give him a long life\" doesn’t satisfy me.\n\nMen who had left Australia together, but who has become separated through being in different companies got together again today, and after warm hand-shakings, they drank together in what they could get. The Guard-mounting this afternoon was most amusing. The C.O. judiciously decided that, considering the state\n\nof the men, the Grande Place was too public, and so, after everything was fixed up as well as possible the Guard was led by the shortest route to a new Mounting Place near the Guard-room. We \nnever\n didn’t expect five of them to get through the ordeal, but \"D\" Coy. men are noted stickers. The O.C. calls them \"rough but honest\". Fifteen paces in front of the old guard, the order \"Left Turn\" was given. All did it correctly except three, who turned to the right. On the order \nOpen Ranks\n to open ranks, the rear rank men must have thought they were in Tasmania, for four of them looked behind before stepping back. One man in the front rank also stepped back, there were wonderful happenings during the \"Examine Arms\", and \"Unfix Bayonets\", but at last the \"Change over\" was complete and the Armistice Celebrating Guard \nwere\n was led to \ntheir\n its new quarters and posts.\n\nThis evening, just before \"Lights Out\" I visited the billets and yarned with the men. Everyone seemed happy. I heard one relating his experiences to his mates, somewhat as follows: - \"We didn’t paint the town red as we might have done if it hadn’t been so far from pay-day, but we celebrated all right. I \"subbed\" nearly all the officers. I told the C.O. I had carried him when we was wounded over two years ago, and he gave me 5 francs. I told Captain – I knew him in Sydney and he gave me five. Captain ---, who knew me out near Brewarrina, gave me 5. I was pretty merry on Von Blink by this time, and I forget what I told the other officers, but I know I \"subbed\" three others. I’m sorry I forget their names, as I can’t pay them back now. But my best \"sub\" was from the Brig. I don’t remember what I told him, but I chucked him a real dinkum salute and breather von blink on him and he gave me 10 \"frogs\". Tonight I saw a Frenchy hanging up a lot of Chinese lanterns and flags and I thought he would be good for a drink but he didn’t \n\nand only said \"Demang!\" At Abbeville, \none\n a digger climbed to the top of the big, well-known, statue to Admiral Courbet, and placed an Australian flag in his hand.\n","481":" – In a tent at EPEHY, between Peronne and Cambrai. – We left Picquigny last night at 8, and marched in the moonlight to Saleux, south of Amiens to entrain. Here we spent a very cold night in French trucks. When we did start this morning at 9 the train barely averaged 3 miles an hour and only reached here at 6 pm. Some of us remember how Fritz shelled this place when we were near here last year. There’s not much left of it and many other formerly well-built towns near by. Those at home who regard the Armistice terms as hard, ought to see as much of France as we have.\n","482":" – At Fresnoy-le-Grand. Leaving Epehy this morning we marched to Templeux-leGeurard, where we entrained on the Decauville Railway. We passed through the Hindenburg Line with its dozens of wide belts of barbed wire, still intact for miles, and all the wreckage of war – guns, mortars, shells, dead horses by the hundred, picks, shovels, limbers, etc. to Brancourt, where we detrained. Near here, Fresnoy, are plenty of Hun machine guns, shells, \"minnies\", ammunition and stores of all kinds. the Hun recently evacuated over 2000 of the inhabitants of Fresnoy, some of whom are beginning to find their way back. the people here used to make some very fine and valuable silk guaze and brocade.\n","483":" Went for a ride this afternoon over a battlefield near here. It is littered with German overcoats, helmets, rifles, machine guns, bombs and ammunition.\n\nI have conversed with many of the inhabitants who have recently returned here from Belgium whence the Germans sent them. They do hate the Bosche. How the civilians\n\nand prisoners were treated by him will be seen from the following particulars supplied to me by residents, and substantiated in every case by others.\n\nAn old merchant of Bohain: - \"The Germans brutally kicked, punched or batoned the young men of the town on the slightest provocation. The young men has no redress.\"\n\n\"Over 2000 residents of Fresnoy were evacuated and 15 died each day along the roads\". A young woman added: - \"My father died along the road. I myself was kept here to work for the dirty Bosches. They beat me and this little girl who was with me with batons to make us work harder in the fields. they made us work within four kilometres of the front line. Their officers and soldiers were all brutal and beat the schoolchildren to make them work harder\"\n\nA French baker of Fresnoy - \"When the Bosche pushed the Allies back in March last we lost all heart. They became very overbearing. there were 20,000 Germans in Fresnoy in February last. The Bosches stole chairs, tables, carpets, curtains, clocks, brass-ware, - everything – and sent them to Germany. We received requisition cards, but never any money for our property. They took all our French coins, - gold, silver and copper, and our jewellery, and gave us German paper money for them. they were always robbing us.\"\n\nA very sad woman of Fresnoy: - The dirty Bosches took my son over \ntwo\n four years ago and I have never heard of him since.\"\n\nThree women of Fresnoy certify that the following is true: - \"English prisoners were brutally treated and starved. Many were shot. One Tommy was found with a potato in his pocket as he was returning from the fields, and was shot in front of your Battalion Orderly room in the presence of the other prisoners without any trial. The English wounded were frightfully treated, once Bosche doctor saying that they were swine and deserved to have their throats cut. \nThey\n We often heard the shrieks of English wounded over 500 metres away. We are certain they were murdered because so many of them were buried. Many English prisoners were barefooted, because the Boshes stole their boots,……\n\nThe Bosches boasted that they would be in\n\nParis in March, London in June, and that they would invade America before the end of the year\"\n\nOthers gave sadder details but they would soil any Journal if printed. \n","484":" – Church Parade in the fields between Fresnoy & Bohain. A Thanksgiving Service for Cessation of Hostilities.\n","485":" – At Fresnoy le Grand. Our Pioneer Sergeant, Sgt Sparrow, has had 50 German prisoners working for him lately. They have cleaned up our area, limbers, cookers & harness, and have dug tranches and carted wood for the company fires. the French women \nat\n where were are billeted, protest that the Australians are too kind to these prisoners, because instead of knocking them with rifles or sticks, they give them cigarettes and stew. The Germans themselves prefer working for us to English or French. Each morning when our Guard goes to their cage to get the party,\n\nthe prisoners hustle each other to get near the top of the column, so as to be in the first fifty. At all crossroads and railway bridges, German prisoners are busy taking the explosives from mines, while the \"Tommy Guards\" stand back at judicious distances.\n\nBeing short of potatoes lately our Sergeants visited the A.S.C. and chummed up with the staff there. When they left, the A.S.C. missed a bag of potatoes. In a similar way a 13th officer and his batman got down on a bale of straw. He had been living comfortably at a School for six weeks and didn’t like the idea of sleeping on a stone floor here. No wonder the A.S.C. regard all \"Two-Blue\" visitors with suspicion. \n\nBattalion went for a Route March to the Source of the Somme.\n\nThe following is an extract from the \"Daily Mail\": - The splendid valor of the Australians has moved the world to admiration. Australia was a Dominion before the war. She was born a Nation on the bloody fields of Gallipoli and France.

We were to put up with hardships in Belgium as the people had had such a bad time, but when we got to Germany we could show them we were masters and make ourselves as comfortable as possible.

He spoke English slightly. He confirmed the stories I had heard of Bosche barbarism against the French civilians and English prisoners. He himself had many personal experienced, the Bavarians stole all his Church ornaments, his vestments and even his alter. \"They used to come to Mass in the morning to look around to see what they could come and steal in the afternoon,\" he said regarding the Bavarians. They used his Church as a prison for English and French prisoners. He was repeatedly forbidden to preach but he persisted in spite of imprisonment. \"I am a Breton and the Bretons are very hard headed\" he boaster. The Germans stole everything all the time.\n\nFor dinner we had whisky and \nwine\n Australian Port wine. the Cure had never before tasted, but has often heard about, \"ooiskey\", as he called it. Trying it he pronounced it \"Tres bon mais tres port\". He had not tasted any decent wine sine the coming of the Germans, and liked our Port exceedingly. We had a very good dinner, - soup joint, plenty of vegetables, tinned fruits and custard, biscuits and cheese. He pronounced it the best mean he had seen during the war, and did ample justice to it. I told him the whiskey was very strong, especially when I saw heated it quantitatively like wine, but with the dinner and the , he forgot my advice and soon became merry. He remarked that his parishoners would talk if they saw him zig-zag or heard him singing going along the street. during the evening he wrote in my book – \"Fresnoy le Grade conservera due passage des troupes Australiennes les milleurs souvieners\n\n\"the Germans here stole everything all the time\" he continued. All the furniture and utensils were quite mixed up for if the Germans wanted a couch, bed, cooking utensils or any article from any other house for their billet thjey took it. when they found they had to retreat they burnt the furniture having no more use for it. I have met the French priest in many towns and conversed with the,. they are intensely patriotic being in my humble opinion, Frenchmen first, priests second.\n","489":" – In a tent in Souplet. We marched 11 miles today. The weather is fine but very cold. In the tent with me are Padre Dunsford, \"Doc\" Merrillees and Dick Swinbourne. Before we left Fresnoy this morning as we marched past some women, a couple exclaimed to me \"You no bon monsieur de capitaine no bon! \"Why?\" I asked. M. le Cure zig zag . They had met him \n\n224th. At Prisches. We marched 19 kilometres today from Souplet. passing through Catillon. The roads were very muddy and all bridges and cross roads blown up by enemy mines. The people here were also robbed of everything of value by the Boshes. Madam’s husband has been a prisoner for over 4 years, He may return any minute, and she wonders what he will be like after his barbarous treatment, but\n\nbeyond that she does not seem at all excited. Perhaps her outward manner does not \nrepresent\n reflect her inward feelings. His old mother sits by the stove muttering to herself about his return. there are non of his cows \nor poultry\n horses or poultry left, for the Bosches forced Madam to sell them at their price in German paper money on which they put an inflated value, reckoning the mark at 15D. the controlled all food here and forced the French farmers to deliver their milk at central laiteries at their price. Madam once kept about 1 ½ gallons for her household, was caught by the Controller, imprisoned and fined 400 marks. All eggs had to be delivered to the officers at their own prices. Poultry was stolen all the time. The whole district is quite denuded of stock. The Bosche stole all the bells throughout the \ndistrict\n occupied parts but left these there having evidently forgotten them, for the people, afraid that\n\nhe would taken them cut the ropes and muffled them so that they has not sounded for over four years until the day the English arrived. \"Ah les Anglais! madam exclaimed\" how the sight of them coming across the muddy fields made us forget those terrible years! And they were such young boys, si gentils. si brave!\"\n","490":" Resting at Prisches – Roads very sloppy and muddy. All locks, culverts and bridges have been destroyed by the Germans and streamlets blocked and so the water cannot get away. All feet were washed today in a warm solution of \nhot\n Condys, and then massaged with Tommy Cooker or methylated spirits.\n","491":" Marched to Sains-du-Nord, through Cartignes, Boulogne, Quatre Maisons and Zorees. Plenty of billeting space here in large factories used by Germans as hospitals. The roads today were very sloppy and\n\ngritty, yet not one man fell out. Some farmers along the road where we halted for 10 minutes (we always halt at 50 minutes past each hour and recommence marching at the hour) gave as many as could get them to coffee. The industries in this area seem to be dairying, fruit and vegetable-growing. There are plenty of apple trees. We passed several creameries and butter factories. Along the road where we camped for lunch was a Communal Orchard, each tree bearing the name of its owner, or the one responsible for it. Some had notices on the them to the effect that the owner had been killed, was a pruner, or still fighting with the French army. How would Communal orchards for the support of our hospitals work in our Australian towns?\n\nOn the long march today old \"Dad\" Hart cheered up his company by singing \"I’m 59 in the Army\" He certainly is a wonderful old man to stand the army life like he does.\n\nSince we passed St. Souplet we have been away from shell-holey country. Fritz used this town as a hospital centre. Everything is frightfully filthy. We always leave our billets clean, and the area free from rubbish. the Germans were evidently very short of cotton for they have only paper bandages in their hospitals here. There are also paper towels, ropes and sandbags, all quite serviceable. I have some of their Billet Notices which translated read as follows: - \n\nNotice for the Soldiers.\n\nAlways\n bear in mind that at home with your people food is scarce. Therefore let \nNothing\n be sent to you from home!. Whatever is sent to you in the field, your people at home must do without!. Be satisfied with what is supplied to you, and don’t waste anything! Whatever is spared your people get at home. Gather scraps, remains of food and bones! They contain valuable stuff, they also serve for food for the animals and again become useful to you in the flesh!\n\n-\nAttention\n\nVERMIN are enemies of human health.\n You must not put up with them, you must seek them out in their hiding places on your bodies, clothes, underclothes, braces, pouches, pocket-books, shoulder-belts, boots etc and destroy them.\n\nHair cuts urgently recommended, it costs nothing (Then follows detailed: Change and Bathroom instructions). Getting rid of Vermin is Service, fulfilling the requirements of the personnel.\n","492":" – Resting a Sains. there are many fine large Chateaux here, owned by the owners and managers of the immense woollen mills than which I have seen no larger buildings in Australia. Single rooms in some of the woollen mills can provide sleeping room for over 3000 men, and \nsome\n each of the three larger mills has several similar rooms. The machinery has been taken away to Germany. A good deal of Australian wool came here, so I am told. These mills supported thousands of workers in very healthy surroundings, for the district is picturesque and surrounded by large forests, and most cottages have gardens attached. Why can’t Australian Wool cause towns like this and Villers Bretonneux and dozens of others over here in a strange country, to spring up in Australia? It seems fine to be obliging and to help any nation to become wealthy is we can do it without injuring ourselves, but it certainly seems\n\nrank madness to send our wool to these places to have it made up and returned to us after the cost of carriage both ways, a hundred handlings, and the wages of thousands of men and women, and tons of machinery, has been added. The owner of the beautiful chateaux and large factory at Villers Bretonneux, where we had our Headquarters, was M. Delaux Chatel a Sydney Woolbuyer. He also had factories at Rheims.\n\nToday was cloudy. Lt. McRae received a Birthday cake from Australia. We had it for supper. We are all busy cleaning up this town for the Germans left it in a filthy state, not because of their hurry in evacuating it either, for the filth is the accumulation of many months, a few amputated legs, for they used these mills for hospitals.\n","493":" – Battalion had a bath at Divisional Baths, and a change of underclothing. We cleaned up some more of the filth left here by the Bosches. McRae received another cake from Australia. We had it for supper – A digger marching to Aveones asked our Traffic Controlled where he was. \"In Sains\" was the reply. \"I didn’t ask yer wot we was\" said the weary one as he trudged on, muttering \"Thinks he ---- funny, I suppose\"\n","494":" At Saine-du-Nord. Address to Brigade by General Drake-Brockman on Demobilisation, and our future moves. We are probably to enter Germany, but not before January. We will probably be near Dinaut for Xmas. It may take some of us over a year to reach Australia. His remarks, put in a straightforward way were quite well received. In reply to a statement that we had enlisted for the duration and four months after, the General replied that as far as Australia was concerned the war was on until the Govenor General issued a proclamation declaring it over.\n\nArranged for Debates to take place next week, also for Section Competitions in my \"A\" Company in General turn out and Work, points to be awarded under the following heads: - Each m an – 100 points\n\nSection Commander and Section Drill – 25 points.\n\nEach man’s points will be given under the following heads: - \n\nPersonal (Hair, cleanliness) – 10 points\n\nUniform – 25 points\n\nFitting of equipment 40 points\n\nRifle and Bayonets 15 points\n","495":" – Bn Parade for eception and unfurling of the Bn. colors, presented by the Women of Australia.

There is an interesting old church at Feron, the tower being dated 1614 and a fine modern church at Fourmies. Population of Fourmies was 15000, and the industries\n\nwere cotton, silk \nand\n pottery and enamel ware manufacturing. the buildings are modern and up todate. It is reported that Clemenceau crushed a strike here a few years ago by martial law and shooting. We were apparently the first Australian in the town for we created great interest. While conversing with a few Yanks attached to the French regiment billeted in the town quite a crowd gathered around. The Yanks were anxious that we should write to They were mechanics in the French Motor Service. The French could not understand why the Yanks spoke our language so fluently.

We commenced our march to Florennes, near Dinant, where we are to spend Xmas. On account of being ill I rode on a Ambulance. We crossed into Belgium about midday. the people here are scrupulously clean and their houses fairly shine, both inside and out. They scrub the outside of their houses. These Belgians are Walloons, and\n\nvery different indeed to the Flemings of Flanders in hospitality, cleanliness. speech and modes of living. they regard the Flemings – \"les Flamands\" with very little love, calling them Germans rather than Belgians. The madame at whose place I am billeted said – \"A Flamand comes with a prayer book in one hand and a knife in the other\". I have a very comfortable, clean bed, and have enjoyed a long conversation with Monsieur, his wife and daughter. They speak better French than the average Frenchman himself. they had been here under German occupation and tell heart rending stories. Livry is a scattered town lying in a valley and when the Armistice was signed the Germans on the eastern hills faced the British on the western, a few shots being fired across the town. One definite case of brutality they told me of was that the Germans had shot some\n\n school children. One was a little girl who had run up to the column of weary starving English prisoners \nand\n to give a \"galette\" (a kind of scone) to one of them. She was immediately shot without any questioning. the three confirmed the story and pointed out the place, They also stated that the Germans treated Belgian prisoners fairly well, paying them small amounts for their labor, but the French and English – especially the English – they treated barbarously, taking their boots from the,, and butting them with their rifles on every possible occasion. English prisoners were often shot and many died of \n\n.\n\nI admired the cleanliness and shining condition of every part of her house. this pleased Madame. She remarked \"A Walloon woman’s greatest delight is in being clean and industrious in her home, a French woman’s greatest delight is to be stylish in the streets of Paris.\"\n\nThey\n Seeing my autograph book they asked me to let them write in it, which they did as follow: - \n\nSivry, le","508":" Nous souhailons la bienvenue a Monsieur le Capitaine Blanc et sa famille. Pascall Chambon, facteur des postes a Sivry (postman) Bertha Pascal. Elvire Chambon.\n\nOn the road today were many signs of German demoralisation, showing that shortly after the Armistice they had become a rabble.There were steel helmets, rifles, ammunition, respirators, packs and tons of equipment scattered everywhere, having been thrown away and apparently kicked about. In two places a whole battalion had apparently acted spontaneously, for steel helmets and equipment \nhad\n for about that number were \nscattered\n littered over about an acre in each case.\n\nI have\n 15th. Dec. Morning, Sivry. Leaving here within a few minutes. this morning a few Belgians took me to see a Belgian flag that had flown from the top of \nthe Mairie or Town Hall\n a two-storeyed building – the Mairie, I think it was, since 1914, before \n\nthe first German arrived. There it was, just a small one – still fluttering its \npaled colors\n faded colors. It \ncould\n had been hauled up on its \nlittle\n pole and fixed so that it could not come down. From only one part of a certain street could it be seen, and so the Bosche had not noticed it. But every day for over four years had my friends and others walked along just that portion to he street to gaze on it. The red and black symbolised the blood shed for their country and the darkness of German occupation, and the yellow the light they had longed for and had now found. It had brought to them, each day during the long four years, a little joy – even if only of derision against their tyrants – The lad who had put it there so firmly had joined the Belgian army, and they had not heard of him since.\n","509":" At Silenrieux. Marched along horrible roads – all muddy and sloppy. Silenrieux is a picturesque village. A train is now running to Bruselles daily. My billet is with M. and Mme Buisseret, a fine couple \nof superior class\n well educated, well read, and very polished. They were very wealthy before the war. He was a grain merchant, and mentioned that he had a high opinion of Australian what. The Germans burnt his home after looting it, although it was not in the war area. \"They shot several civilians here for no reason at all\" they told me, \"and even little children were shot in the district.\" they confirmed the previous statements I have mentioned of the barbarous treatment meted out to English prisoners by the Hun, \"les sales Bosches!\" they wrote in my book. \"Silenrieux le 15.12.1918 Silenrieus conserve meilleurs souvenierss des Australiens. F. Buisseret, Laure Buisseret. Gabrielle Buisseret.\"\n\n16th. Dec 1918. At Florennes, where we are to stay for Xmas and New Year. It rained today for most of the journey. The 14th Bn. branched off a Phillipville for St. Aubin, the 15th remained there and the ","510":" came on\n\nhere with us. It was at Phillipville that Napolean spent \nhis first\n the night after Waterloo. Along the track today were a great many German motor cars, lorries and transport gear, nearly all wantonly smashed, or partly burned and most of these will be beyond repair. Some had been run full speed into drains or down hill. \nwhere\n In one place a big gun and several wagons had been let go down hill uncontrolled \nuntil\n and \nwere\n are now lying as a tangled mass of wreakage along the roadside. The Germans apparently went to pieces on their retreat through here, and we hear similar reports from other quarters. To mock the retreating, the Belgians of all the villages near here brought out all their brass and copper articles, and placed them on their doorsteps or windowsills, all polished up hastily for the occasion. They had been ordered on several occasions during the war to give these up, their houses had been entered and ransacked on many occasions \nbut\n and many found with brass or copper in any form had been fined and imprisoned, but still the\n\nmajority had found safe hiding places. I was shown some of these in chimneys, under \nthe\n fireplaces and even in latrines. It appeared to me to be petty to deride the retreating Germans in this way and I mentioned it to a few Belgians, but they replied \"Ah monsieur you don’t know the Germans. (les sales Bosches) and you can never imagine how strongly we shall forever hate them. It was good to show then that they had not cowed us altogether\" How they will treasure that copper kettle, that door knob, and the other little copper or brass articles, and that little faded flag at Sivry.\n\nAlthough he had been so brutally Germam in his dealing with these people the Bosche has not destroyed these towns as he did those of France – even those not near the line. We noticed a typical example of this hatred of France and this crude attempt \nto gain\n not to embitten the Belgians too much, as we crossed the border a few days ago. On one corner was a great mass of ruins – all that was left of two large French farms, on the other corner is Belgium, but only fifty yards away were a Belgian farm and\n\nestaminet quite untouched, except for their brass door knobs and window-locks, which had been taken. The Belgian prisoners, I think I have mentioned, were also better treated than the French or British.\n\nHere at Florennes \nwe\n the officers have comfortable billets, but in their billets the men are somewhat cramped for space. \nbut\n However this has apparently already been remedied by the people themselves inviting the Diggers to sleep at their places, for, when I visited my company this evening, about thirty informed me that they had found good homes. – And we only arrived here this afternoon. I have a comfortable clean room with clean sheets – the third time in my three nights in Belgium. The people are very courteous and anxious to do all they can for us. They have been in the habit of washing for, and waiting on, the Germans without pay, and the habit has grown on them to such an extent that they were quite astonished this evening when I asked \"How much?\" for the washing of a few handkerchiefs and socks. They were more astonished when I told them we would let them do nothing at all for us without pay, and they, in addition to the\n\nfranc per day \nshe\n they would receive from the Authorities for my bed, I would give \nher\n them another franc myself. There was great excitement in the house when my batman brought in some Sunlight Soap from the Canteen. They has not seen any proper soap \nfor\n since the war started for all fats had been commandeered. There was similar excitement when I brought in from our mess a cup of sugar, and child aged five did not know what a chocolate was, never having seen one. He soon found out, however, and is not like Oliver Twist. Here too, Madam proudly shows a few door knobs and a copper jug, and describes jubilantly how she had then out on the doorstep as the Germans retired. Madam has two children of her own, and two nieces from Flanders, which live with her to learn French. She is a Flamand herself, but dislikes the Flamands of Flanders – from Ghent, Bruges and Ypres – and said that the people here were afraid of the Flamands working in the district. The only union between these\n\ntwo distinct races in Belgium is the one of Belgium, both being Roman Catholic. – butter here, when procurable is 10\/- a lb., and eggs at Charleroi at 1\/2 ½ each.\n","511":" – Remained in bed until 11 am. as I have a poisoned face. Speaking to a group of Belgians this morning they told me they were better treated by the Germans than the French or English, that the Germans hated the English above all other nations, and that they had repeatedly spoken of the wonderful colonial troops of England.

Our men tried to get up a dance this evening. they hired the schoolroom, cleaned it out and prepared the floor, carried a piano along, and waited for the ladies. But none came. The priests and sisters advised them not to. In Morialme, a neighbouring village they have dances regularly, but here there is a large Jesuit College, and the brothers evidently think it inadvisable for the young women to attend dances with the Australians. - Lectured to Bn. on \"the Unification of Italy and Germany\".\n\nFlorennes – Tacitus, the famous Roman soldier historian, in his annals tells of a Noble of the County of Treves, names Florus who, having formed a party against the Romans, was defeated and obliged to hide in the Forest of Ardennes, which then extended from the Rhine to Rheims, and so included the site of Florennes, names after Florus. The Chateau of Florennes was constructed in 944 as a fort against the Normans who every year came from Holstein to ravage these parts.

From their arrival in Belgium, the Bosches showed themselves true barbarians, advancing into the country with a torch in one hand and a sword in the other,\n\nmarking their passage by pillage, burning and murder. They made our pretty little Dimant a heap of \nruins\n ashes. Many other towns were burnt and their inhabitants shot under the pretext that they were \"franc tireurs\". At Dimant 650 people were murdered; among the victims were children of two years who were also undoubtedly \"franc-tireurs\".\n\nOh, the Bosches, how we hate them! They imagined they by terrorising us they would keep us under their heel. They \nimagined\n thought that 1914 would be quickly forgotten, but they know not the Belgians, and the Belgians have learnt to know them. We smiled, the Bosches were pleased. How little did they know that our smile was a smile of mockery. Our pleasure was to deceive them, and our glory was to play the farce to them in our fashion. On their retreat they were chagrined to see the brass and copper that we had kept hidden from them, in spite of their frequent searchings, shining on our doorsteps\n\nII. A Joke against the Hun: - All newspapers were suppressed by the Germans, except those printed under their supervisor, and which were issued to cause dissension among the Belgians, and a hatred of England. Happily, some had the courage to expose these Bosche plans, and many suffered terribly for it. However, there appeared each week a little Journal called \"Free Belgium\", printed and distributed secretly. It was read right throughout Belgium and kept up the spirit of the Belgians, by showing the Bosche lies, and by giving reassuring news of the situation. After reading it we felt comforted, courageous, and confident of the future. The Germans were furious, but they could not find the printer nor distributors. It specially mocked the German Governor, to whom a copy was mysteriously delivered each week. He was enraged. Now one day he received an anonymous letter telling him where to find the press, What good Luck!\n\nAt last he could punich the printers. All instructions were given for a strong party to visit the place. A long search, much opening of doors, climbing of stairs and ladders, and crawling through dark dirty places, at last brought them to the exact spot. They rushed the place, smashed in the door and found ……..a W.C.!\n\nThis same Belgian wrote in my autograph book as follows|; - \n\n\"Hommage a la vaillante armee australienne, qui a si bien contribue a la liberation de la pauvre Belgique!!\"\n\n\"Nous garderons longtemps le bon souvenie des aimables officers du 13me. bataillon australien.

During 1917 he had exported 70 tons of these nails from Carleroi to England via Holland and Switzerland. Before the Bosche retreat however in 1918 they \nhad\n stole all his machinery and took it to Germany. \nHe\n Today he had a pass to Germany and an order to the Belgian \nMilitary\n Army of Occupation to assist him in his visits to German factories for the purpose of choosing such machinery as he liked, and to give him the necessary military aid to remove this machinery\n\nto his factory at Charleroi. He jubilantly stated that he should have a far more up-to-date factory \nwhen he\n after his visit than he had had before.\n\nHe was on a Secret Committee in Charleroi to help British prisoners. Each night between 12 and 2 a few boats with muffled oars crossed the canal at the rear of the prisoners’ cage. The prisoners took it in turns to fill the boats and were taken into a well-hidden building, \nand\n given a good hot meal, and then rowed back again. This had gone on for a couple of years.\n\nA Belgian woodcutter had found an escaped \"Tommy\" in the forest \nnear le Ca\n south of Charleroi. At great risk he hid him in a forest hut, and each day he or some of his friends took \nfood\n and left food in an appointed place near the hut.\n\nThere must have been a great deal of slackness in the \"Tommy\" Quartermaster Department. For the past two years our diggers have been able to buy from Tommies, officers’ breeches, ordnance pattern for 20 francs, and lately some Tommies of the R.A.F. have been selling cases of margarine, dozens of tins of jam and condensed milk and other Quartermaster Department supplies for about half their wholesale price.\n\nSaluting through the Corps has become slack lately, and we have received several notes about it. The men always salute officers of their own battalions but seldom those of other Bns. except C.O.’s, or generals. Surely this ought to be sufficient. On Parade, and during Parade hours, and within one’s own Bn. saluting seems to me to be quite valuable both for officers and men. The \nGeneral\n Brigadier and Generals in whose charge we are should also receive this mark of respect, but why men and officers not on duty should be continually springing to attention, and worried by\n\nwatching for superior officers \nto come\n coming along, when their minds and bodies should be enjoying the recuperation that only come by getting as far away as possible from the punctilious discipline of parade, is to me quite useless and irritating. It also seems to militate, by the fact that it worries against efficiency. The system certainly wants reviewing, for it is better to have no system at all then one that is only so imperfectly carried out, and one that irritates.\n\nThat it is an effort is seen from the fact that very few \nfield\n officers of field rank do more in returning a salute than wag a stick of whip.\n\n\"Teddy Woodbine\" (Prince of Wales) who has been with us a good deal lately is not the shy little boy he was in Egypt. He is reported to have tried his hand at our \"National Sport\" of tossing two pennies in the air to see if they come down alike.

Alan Brierley in this hospital with influenza.\n\nTalking over dinner last night an officer of the K.O.S.B. remarked that he thought the Australians the best fighters in the war but it was a great pity they were not better at discipline. This seemed to be the opinion of the fifteen Imperial officers that the Guards were at least equal to the Australians as fighters. The fact that they were all \"Active Service\" officers made me feel very proud of this tribute so spontaneous and unanimous – regarding the Australians fighting quality! But in a friendly way I pointed out that I thought any British regiment with the training and traditions of the Guards, and especially if they were used just as the Guards were, would equal them in every way.\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Well I have the highest admiration for the Guards and recognize that their achievements have been \n glorious\n wonderful and that they have never gone back on the highest British traditions, but, they are not used solely as Shock Troops, or for special stunts. They are taken out of the trenches, right away from fatigue work, and kept out until something special is again required of them. Your other British regiments - and the Australians too – are not only called upon to fight and act as Storm Troops or forlorn hopes, but when their attacking, raiding and defending are done, they have still to hold\n\non, - or digging, carrying, wiring, patrolling, duckboarding, draining, revetting, running, pumping – sodden and shivering for week after week, \n and\n month after month and even year after year. Can you expect these men not to be somewhat \"slack\" – if you like to call it so – when they get away from this almost constant environment.\n\nYes, your guards are splendid indeed, but their deeds are such that bring limelight – well-deserved, it is true, - but don’t forget what the ordinary Tommy of London, Devon, Yorkshire or anywhere else, or the ordinary Jock from Liverpool, London or Glasgow has been \ndoing\n all the time.\n\nBut \"Better Discipline\" in their opinion, would still be an advantage to the Australians, without detracting from their recognised fighting qualties. \"Do you hold the British sailor up as equal to your \nhighest\n best in fighting and disclipine?\" \nI asked\n \"We do that!\"\na few quickly\n they emphatically \nreplied\n agreed . \"Well in my opinion the Diggers are \nlike\n in many ways like your sailors. \nHe does\n They do their Battalion duties thoroughly, but when they, or your Jack Tars, are away from their units \nthey\n some of them are not conventionally correct in matters of general appearance, sobriety, conversation and even saluting.. the \"off duty\" conduct of your sailors is not noticed because you see so many of\n\nthem, and because they keep down in their usual haunts in the ports, but the Australian is noticed by all, for he and his uniform as new to you; and, as he is a wanderer, he gets everywhere, and when he gets a few drinks in he will sing and talk. Like a broken bottle of Kerosene in a parcel of groceries, the off duty Australian permeates everywhere. I have seen your Naval Officers walking through the streets near your docks among dozens of sailors enjoying themselves without being noticed, let alone saluted\".\n\nI was becoming garrulous for we were a pleasant company and all taking the argument pleasantly. \"And it’s my opinion\", I continued, that the average\n\n\"Digger\" salutes more than the average \"Tommy\" This \ncaused\n last remark caused a general \nroar\n denial.\n\n\"Well I’ll bet everyone \nten shillings\n a dinner I can prove it to your satisfaction.\n\nSeveral wanted to accept, so I agreed to take them in turns if they still wanted it after the first one had lost his \nhalf sovereign\n money.\n\nSo this evening an officer of \"The Lions\" and myself spent two hours walking \nthe Strand\n Whitehall, Strand, Trafalgar Square, Haymarket and Piccadilly. We had agreed to take the percentage of salutes received from men passing us on the same footpath. Apart from the \nhalf sovereign\n dinner I felt it a point of honor to win, so I wore my\n\nAustralian hat, and bendes trying to catch every digger’s eye, \nI\n on two occasions when I felt I was slipping I half-commenced the salute myself. I also nodded to two others who would otherwise have not seen us. In this way out of 19 Australian we passed 17 saluted which out of 23 Tommies only 15 saluted. As my friend paid for the dinner, he remarked :Your Australian hat must have done the trick.\" \"It was a good deal more than that,\" I replied.\n","546":" - In","547":" L.G.H. – Read History of Europe 1814 – 1914 by E Barren-Smith. – \n\nA bright warm day.\n\nEntry","548":" – Still in","549":" L.G.H. – Have had two injections of Corossal Manganese for my boils. they are getting better –drying up – but the cure is very severe.
