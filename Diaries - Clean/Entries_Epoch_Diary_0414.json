It is a moving service, church at sea & one feels how much we are dependant on our creator. The Capt conducted the service & it did one good to note how heartily he entered into the spirit of it.

The Harbor opens out & we berthed at a magnificent wharf. Kaffirs, Zuloes, etc. were there & we were much interested in them. We fell in at 9.30 am as usual but there was nothing doing.

They were coaling the boat all night €” wages 3\/-, the chief engineer told me that they did more work in 2 hrs than did the wharfies the whole of the time ^we were in Freemantle. he reckoned the workmen of Australia were awful. The men (natives) are well built men & were apparently? controlled by native policemen who carried heavy sticks which they applied vigorously to the bare skins of the kaffirs our men enjoyed it & would throw money among them just to disorganise things\n\n At 1.30 pm we were taken ashore for a route march €” to the beach. Saw a number of native married women. they carry the hair in a huge t??? on the back of the head.\n\n Returned to boat at 4 pm & got men aboard.\n\n A man of war (Hyacynth) came in.

Her engines are damaged by explosives.\n\n Had great sport with the natives, they danced some of their dances, & when money was thrown over they scrambled in the muddy water for it, a real scrimmage sometimes our chaps would heave a bucket full of water over them. The natives are awfully good tempered & did not fight for the coins. I really laughed heartily over their fun\n\n About 6 pm we left the wharf & immediately we were followed by a cruiser €” we saluted her & in the half light she returned it.

The Wiltshire with Australian troops aboard gave us a great welcome they did cheer. we bumped the wharf pretty hard. Cape Town looked charming nestled as it is under Table Mountain I have seldom seen a more beautiful picture.\n\n At 10.30 we were permitted to go ashore €” Hotels had been closed & marched to the Gardens up the famous Government avenue. I hardly recognised Capetown. There were no Rickshaws & the natives were entirely different to those in Durban €” numerous half castes & indians they do not seem so happy either.\n\nGreat crowds lined the streets & every now & then they cheered us. . Capetown ladies had arranged stalls for visiting troops & charged 1d all round. We dismissed at the gardens.\n\n I tried to find Deacon but didn't see him so after lunch I wandered to the museum €” very disappointed. Native side much neglected.

We passed some of the Military Hospitals, & the home of Cecil Rhodes.\n\n I met Chaplin Bonetker? €” a surprise. he is a relation of the Perth Bonetkers? he is a real decent chap & with him I visited the Rhodes Memorial, a stiff walk through the Zoo. Energy & a remarkable work. it looks as if it had been modelled with a fist & finished off with a pick. I was held spell bound & admired its beauty, whilst in the spot I made a rough sketch & finished it later. Right in the rear is a simple bust of Rhodes & above in simple type are the words \"To the spirit & life work of Cecil John Rhodes who loved & served South Africa.\" The statue in the center front is awfully rough, there is no finish anywhere, the bust even is extremely rough but there is \"some\" effect\n\n We had tea behind the Memorial €” afterwards walked to the tram & city\n\nXXX\n\n75\n\n We walked to the Cathedral & noting lights walked in €” the sub dean was conducting evensong. To me it seemed so far as the words were concerned just a jumble, but surrounded by a beautiful building one was constrained by the touch of reverence. The building is German Gothic €” very heavy in type & after service the subdean showed to us a remarkable book cost £1000 it contains all the names of soldiers who died in the South African War. it is locked up in a little shrine in the choir. All the names are printed by hand on lamb skin each unit separately, beautiful designs head each list, & the whole effect is one of peace. The binding is of leather €” tanned by natives of Rhodesia & around the cover are the words \"There is also an unwritten memorial of their graves in the hearts of men\"\n\n We roamed round had supper & went back to the boat - had a glance over the Wiltshire €” their men are more cramped than ours\n\n 11.3.17\n\n Left the wharf & anchored in Table Bay with other transports, The Himilaya had disappeard during the night.

A pretty little bay lies behind the light house white people were bathing there. Inland it presents a number of high hills heavily wooded. Freetown rests at the foot of the slopes it fringes the coast & looks awfully dilapidated, houses are sheltered by the trees & in only a few cases here they built on the hill tops.\n\n We anchored in front of Freetown & during the next day or so I will make sketches We are taking water aboard.
