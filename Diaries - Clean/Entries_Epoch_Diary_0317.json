\n\nBecordel\n\n Sat. The Bugles are in use in this camp which makes it quite homely. Reveille at 6. Break. at 7. Bacon & Tea. Parade at 8. One party of the gallant 8th went down to the Quarry & loaded limbers with chalky rock which was carted up to the party I was working with. We are making a road for the motors to come in on, off the Bazentin Road. It is marvellous the amount of traffic that passes along the Roads. There is a constant stream night & day never ceasing. The German prisoners\n\n","1":"\n\nare working right alongside us. Poor devils. I haven’t much time for ‘em, but they detest the mist & rain as much as we do. Stan Wright & I went into Albert We got a lift in a motor lorry, both in & out. Had a look round the Town, but there’s not much to see. The Church is the most interesting item. It must have been a beautiful building before the Huns spoilt it. Went into a Cottage in the Town & had some coffee. They use condensed milk tins for cups & charge 3d a time. Quite a number of civilians have returned to the town since the Germans were driven out. There are a no. of shops where one can buy chocolate, p.cards, etc. Of course everything is very dear. We returned to camp at Dinner time. After Dinner we did more roadmaking. We were sitting round the fire after Tea when Fritz dropped a few shells just outside our tent, which made things up somewhat.\n","2":" We fell in 9 for Church Parade. C of E were put on fixing up Tents (I was one of ‘em) R.C’s went into Albert, & attended service there. Instead of singing Hymns they knocked down old houses & loaded bricks on to Waggons. We were kept working all day, although it was Sunday & we are supposed to be resting. Rations are very scarce & we often go to Bed with an empty feeling in our \"Little Mary’s\". A small mail came in today. I got one letter from Nell & 1 from Lill’s Aunt at Southend sent the Southend Letter on to M.S. Billsy May got word to say that his leave pass is in, & he’s mighty excited about it. Lucky beggar. Tea was a very poor meal. Just Tea & a dry Biscuit\n\nMon 13. After Break. I paraded to Capt. Woods about my boots which are soulless & let in the water so he told me to see what I could get from the Dumps. After fossicking around for an hour or so I managed to find a pair, also puttees.\n","3":" It was at the 5th Dump I got ‘em & while there I met \"Tiny O’Brien\" & who were in the next tent to me at Liverpool. The first thing they said was \"How’s the wife?\" so I must tell old B.E. that next time I write. After Dinner we went to the Baths, where we got rid of some of our \"Big Game\". Gee! What a treat it was to take off our chatty shirts & get under a hot shower, to soap ourselves all over, then have a good rub down with a dry towel & put on a clean shirt. It was glorious. First decent wash we’ve had for months. Billsy May went away this morning to \"Blighty\". We gave him a hearty send off. He was one big smile. Gave him my diary to post to Aunt Nell, also a Letter to post to M.S. The nightly issue of Rum is always very welcome. It makes a good night cap before retiring for the night.\n\nTues. Nov 14 The Bombardment has been terrific this last few days. Our Guns are sending it over to Fritz hot & strong, night & day, without ceasing. Most of us are suffering from Headaches & no bloomin’ wonder. After Break. we went into Albert. Doherty, Deed, Jackson, 12 of us in all where we demolished old houses & loaded the bricks on to waggons We worked in the shadow of the Church & the Infant Jesus (in the arms of the Virgin Mary) hung almost over our heads. It seems a terrible thing that such a beautiful piece of work should be knocked about by the Huns. The 5th F.A. sent us out some Tea & stew for Dinner, in a motor, but most of it got spilled on the way & we got very little. Got back to Camp in time for Tea, which consisted of a dry Biscuit & a drink of Tea. The Rum issue out out too. Thank the Lord I got 2 letters from M S tonight which made life worth living again.\n","4":" Got word tonight that our chaps are holding 2 lines of trenches. Some of our Bearers are bringing the wounded up from the Train to the Tents. They are all very cheerful\n","5":" The party working at the station last night returned to Bunk this morning about 5. They were knocked up. Les Townshend, Alec, & a number of others from B sec. & a no. from A sec. making 26 in all were told off to go to \"the Quarry\". They took all their gear with ‘em, so are evidently going to stay some time. After Dinner we were told off to strike two big tents, then we could knock off & have a good nights rest. \n\nAfter Tea we were sitting round the fire smoking & yarning, when W.O. Black came into the Tent & informed us that a party of 26 Bearers had to report to a Railway siding about 3 miles away for Train Duty. Of course we thought it was to transport wounded, & took our slings with us. We rode out to the siding in a char-a-banc. Just before we left W.O. Black gave Lorry Trousdale a jar of Rum for the party. On arriving at Meaulte Siding we found that we had to unload 9 motor lorries of Huts, in parts, & load them on to trucks. It was jolly hard work & the night was frightfully cold. The rails & sleepers were white with frost. We were kept going solid till about 12.30 then we walked back to Camp. Lorry gave us 2 good nips of Rum, which put a bit of Life into us, otherwise we’d have been frozen.\n\nThur 16, Issued with shirts, socks, sheepskin vests, a pair of woollen gloves, also sheepskin mittens, so we ought to keep out the cold now alright. I didn’t require a vest as I stuck to the one I was issued with in Egypt. We got back to Camp about 2 this morning, & Kirby lit a fire. We raided the cookhouse & found\n","6":" some stew & cold Tea, which we heated up & had a feed before \"turning in\" Then we slept till Dinner time, when we got up & had some more stew. A few papers came in. I got 2 from France, which were very welcome, especially the \"Sentinel\". B.E’s Letters are always the soul of cheerfulness; & are worth their weight in gold. Gee! That Kid’s a marvel. Some of the crowd went into Dernancourt & loaded up stores; the rest of us had an easy day, for once. Got paid after Dinner (I drew 40 francs) & tonight we are trying to fill up the \"aching void\" with Biscuits & Chocolate, (purchased from the Canteen) This is a rotten Camp for tucker, if we couldn’t buy a feed occasionally we’d starve. Wish I could send a cable to Lill, but it’s very difficult to do so from here. What a great day we’ll have when we turn our backs on \"The Somme\".\n","7":" Nearly froze to death last night, although we have plenty of blankets. The news from the front line continues good. They say we are holding the Ridge in front of Bapaume. A Taube went over the 13 F.A. D.S. & dropped Bombs. Killed the orderly room staff with one Bomb. Dropped another on a big tent & killed & wounded 36. Our A.A. guns brought the Taube down. The observer was killed & the Pilot came through our Hospital wounded in the Lungs. Worked in the Quarry all day loading Limbers with stone to put on the Roads. It was jolly cold & we were very glad to get back to our Tent again. After Tea wrote to Aunt Pudney & France.\n\nSat. 18. Gee whiz: snow on the ground when we turned out this morning. Hurt my ankle by twisting in the mud M.D. told me to take a couple of days \"off duty\" & spell it. The rest of the crowd are working at the Quarry again. It is raining & the roads are as muddy as ever.\n","8":" We carried on the good work in the afternoon, spreading metal on the roads. The 8th will certainly leave a monument behind us on \"the Somme\" in the way of good roads. We had cocoa & Biscuits for Supper, quite a luxury.\n\nSun. 19. They didn’t call it \"Church Parade\" today, but just told off the different parties on to their Jobs. Reg Sutton & Dad Good are making Garbage Boxes. They knocked off at 11.45 instead of 12 & Col. crimed ‘em. After Dinner we were issued with Comforts. Lollies, Cocoa & milk, cigtts tobacco, etc, so we are living very high lately. Blue Riley is breaking out in pimples. Gen. Birdwood inspected the camp. A good no. of wounded are coming through, but they all reckon we are giving the Huns \"particular Hell\". They turned every one of the Bearers out last night, but when we reported at Receiving Point we found we were not wanted, so returned to Bunk. Les Townshend & Jack Keen paid us a visit from the Quarry. Towny\" has the shoulder strap which he cut off the tunic of the Hun airman, when came through wounded.\n\nMon. 20. The 14th Bearers went out to the line this morning. Last night I wrote to M.S. Reg Sutton’s case was to have come off today, but was postponed. Cleaning up Camp. Snowy\", Bert Hunt & party went into Dernancourt & brought back a load of stretchers & blankets. Bert Hunt heard a few days ago that his brother was killed, but today he got word from a chap in the same Batt. that he was alive & well. After Tea we went to the station & brought over a load of wounded. We got orders tonight to pack up & be ready to move back to \"the Line\" tomorrow. Lorry . issued us with 48 hours rations. Glory Halleluia! Got 4 Letters. 1 each from Lill, France, Mother & Cis We \"chatted\" our shirts very carefully, as we may not have the chance again for some time. Mac\" gave me a hand , & I caught 9, which we mercifully incinerated with the candle.\n","9":" Reveille at 6. Break. 6.45. Fell in at 8 in marching order. I was told to stay behind as my old ankle was still \"out of action\". The rest of the crowd marched away to \"somewhere unknown\" about 9. W.O. came into the Tent, which was in a glorious mess & told me to clean it up. I just got going nicely when \"Wing\" Smaile of A sec. arrived on the scene. He had just been discharged from Hospital after an attack of \"flu\", so he nobly assisted me. Just after Dinner the 1st F.A. arrived & occupied our old Tent. Wing\" & I went over to the station to try & find out where the gallant 8th were, but met with no success: so we settled down for the night. The 1st are a decent crowd, but I missed good old B. sec. \"Wing\" & I turned in together. He was very \"chatty\" & while he hunted among his clothes, I wrote a few lines to M.S. but I couldn’t write much as \"Lights Out\" went, so I had to cut it short.\n\nWed 22 After Break. Wing\" & I packed up & reported to Maj. Bollan who gave us a note to the R.T.O. at Albert station to arrange for our transport to Vignacourt somewhere near Amiens, where our Nursing sec. are, but the R.T.O. dashed our hopes to the ground by telling us to report to Bellevue Farm along the Bray Road, only about a mile away. We got there in time for Dinner. Machonochie’s & B’d & Butter, quite a decent feed. Bellevue Farm is a pretty good camp, made up of wooden huts, which are quite warm. Here the stragglers from the different divisions are collected & sent on to their units. There is a Y.M.C.A. Hut in the camp, where cocoa & biscuits can be obtained at 1 per cup & 1d per pkt. Needless to say it is well patronised. We made ourselves comfortable & slept in till 8 next morning.\n\nThur 23. After Break. I was walking along to get a wash when I met Capt. Nance & Reg Laycock, who had just returned from leave to \"Blighty\". Paraded to the Doctor, who examined my foot & said I could return to my unit, so we packed up & the 4 of us (Smaile, Capt Nance, Laycock & myself) & reported back to the Rest\n","10":" Camp at Becordle. Here we got orders to report to Bernafay Wood (right of Montaubon) where the gallant 8th\" are posted. We drew rations from the Q.M. & started off on our 5 mile \"jaunt\". Capt Nance stayed behind with the 15th F. Amb. On our way we picked up another chap who was on his way to join the 14th. Before leaving Becordle I got some green envelopes from the","11":" Ord. Room. So now I can write a good long Letter to M.S. Hooray. We got a lift part of the way in a limber, then we struggled along on our pins through the mud for another mile or so when we got another ride in a motor ambulance. The Roads were in a frightful state, mud up to the knees & we were jolly glad when we eventually arrived at the A.D.S. I soon found Snowy\" Atherton Mac\" & the old crowd. They soon make themselves snug, wherever they are. A nice fire was burning & the place looked quite snug. Jacko\" grabbed my mess tin & got me a feed of stew & some Tea. It was good to be back with the old B’s again. Laycock appeared after Tea & told us all about the glorious time he had in London. Snowy\" Ath & I made a double bunk & we turned in about 9.\n","12":" This is rather an exciting part of the country to be in. Fritz put over a no. of shells quite near to our Tent. I didn’t sleep much. Paraded at 9, then we got orders to pack up & be ready to move off at 1 o’clock, to go out to the trenches & carry on the good work. After a good feed of stew we started off under Capt Woods to the different Posts. Snowy, Mac Stan Wright & I with Sgt. Roberts came to No. 1 Post. The wounded are brought here, & our squad load them on to the Waggons. It is 10 p.m. now & we are sitting in the dugout yarning. A few shells are screaming past but are bursting some distance away (Thank Goodness) There is a Canadian Battery near here & Fritz is after ‘em. A shell burst right outside this dugout just we arrived but no one was hit. One of the","13":" was killed this morning, H.E. through the heart.\n","14":" Only a few cases came in during the night. It was very miserable & cold & we were very glad when daylight appeared, although we did get busy again. The fire we had going made the place quite cheerful & the poor devils in from the Trenches appreciated it. We got a fair crack of rations & we cooked Bacon for Breakfast. Just over the road from us the \"Comforts Fund\" keep cocoa & soup \"on tap\", day & night, for the men coming in from the trenches. The Padre runs it (Rev. Ward) & he has 4 light duty men from the Inf. to cut wood & keep the fires going. We went into Delville Wood to get wood for our fire. No wonder it is called \n. Devil’s Wood. Its as near an approach to Hell as one could wish to see. Every tree in it, is either blown out from the roots, or splintered, & no matter in what direction one looks, one can see dead bodies, in all stages of decomposition. Tommies, Scotties, Huns, & an awful number were crushed under the timber. The fighting must have been very fierce about here. One poor beggar they brought in had been lying wounded in \"No Mans Land\" since Monday. His face was a \"smoky yellow\" & he told us that he had kept himself alive by eating the ice from his own urine. \n\nSun. 26. Last night Fritz put a few shells very close to our dug out. About 2 a.m. he dropped one in a dug out about one hundred yards away where 3 men of the 58th were sleeping. Two were killed outright; & the 3rd man (C.E.Wright) got 6 shrapnel wounds about the legs which we fixed up. He was anxious to know how his mates were, & we had to pitch a tale. It has rained like blazes ever since we have been here, but now we are about to be relieved the sun is actually shining. Poor old Kirb sprained his ankle last night & had to return to Camp. The water supply ran out just before dark last night, & Mac & I had to go into A.D.S. to report it. We went across the Paddock where the track is marked by white posts, but returned along the road, as it was misty & we didn’t like the idea of being \"bushed\". It was quite an exciting walk as in places the mud is up to one’s middle. We arrived back wet through & the cup of cocoa the mob had ready went down real well.\n\nA chap named Mitchell came in with a scalded foot. He & Snowy Atherton had a great yarn about the East. Subs. footballers. During the night our dug out got flooded & the water was over boot tops. We did our best to clean it up & make it a bit decent for the 14th. We had plenty of cocoa & milk & kept a drop always on hand. The","15":" arrived about 1.30 & we were mighty glad to see ‘em. We returned back to our Camp, where we found ourselves moved into another Tent. soon rooted out another fire pot & we were quickly just as snug as we were in the old Tent. The Rum Issue was greatly appreciated before we turned in between our blankets. Snowy & I slept together. The \"chats\" & Fritz’s shells made sleep almost impossible.\n","16":" This morning we were allowed to sleep in Lord how we did appreciate it. We didn’t turn out till Dinner time. After Dinner we were issued with Lace up Boots to the knees. Some of ‘em are real good, but others are just as useless. We had stew for Tea, & then went to Bed early as everyone was tired.\n","17":" One party went out woodcutting & another lot worked at A.D.S. loading & unloading patients. It was fearfully cold. We saw a Taube brought down. There are 2 very big guns near our Tent, & we can hear the shells whistling through the air for nearly 20 secs. Mac & Deed went out with the 15th. The big game is very numerous & our wag has renamed Devils Wood, Chatswood. Sergs Thomson & Roberts were evacuated. S.L It is very rotten not being able to write Letters. Old B.E. will be getting worried.\n","18":" Crowds of chaps are coming in from the Trenches with Trench Feet. MacMahon, a chap out of C sec. & I paraded sick this morning. Mac had boils on his Back; C sec man had pains in his chest, I had a cold in my Kidneys. The MD (so called) distributed a bottle of pills among us. The weather is frightfully cold & the poor chats are feeling it keenly. Thank Goodness the Rum is plentiful in this Camp. Got issued with Knee Boots today, but most of ‘em are no good.\n","19":" Paraded at 9 & got ready to go out & face the foe again. We went out to No. 3 Post (Battery) the worst of the lot. It is about a mile & a half long. There are duck boards the whole distance, but in places they are in very bad condition & a man stands a good risk of breaking his leg. Snowy Atherton, Stan Wright Jacko & I formed our squad. I felt very crook & carrying some of the heavy chaps nearly broke me up. An awful lot of trench feet cases came through but very few wounded. Our dugout is very small & 4 of us have to squeeze very tight to get in at all\n","20":" Last night was awful. Our fire went out & it was freezing, the chats got busy & chewed us to pieces. A few cases came through up to midday, then she quietened down. To make matters worse no rum came to light last night. Jacko & I brought in a load of wood from Delville we got a fire going & cooked some Bacon. After Dinner Fritz put a good few shells over & livened things up a bit. About 6 p.m. the cases commenced coming through again. More trench feet. Some of the poor beggars are in an awful mess. I just returned from taking in a patient when something went wrong with the works & I broke down. Reg Hancock took my place in the squad. Fritz put over a barrage & got some of the 29th as they were changing over. One good thing it was moonlight & we could see our way quite plainly. The French & our guns replied to Fritz’s challenge & the din was terrific.\n","21":" About 60 patients came through during the night & our crowd were knocked out. Bricky, Jimmy Woods & a no. of others broke down during the night. Our fire was burning low & Snowy Atherton went out & got a tin of kerosene to liven it up. He poured it on – & the fire went bang out. He made a mistake & brought water instead of oil. Needless to say he got some very uncomplimentary remarks hurled at him.\n\nThe 14th came out early & relieved us. Bricky & I reported at the A.D.S. where they took our Temps. Bricky was 101.2 & I was The M.O. told us to go straight to Bed which we did & stayed there till Sunday morn.\n","22":" Capt Nance came to see me after Break & ordered me to be evacuated. Took my gear down to A.D.S. (with the assist of Les Townshend) where we were given a drink of hot cocoa while waiting for the Cars. They took my boots away & only left me my pack. After about 2 hours waiting I got away in a car to where the 5 F. AMB are. Here we got more hot coffee & were examined by another doctor who marked our tickets C.R.S. or C.C.S. Mine was marked C.R.S. After waiting here for about 3 hours we got another ride to C.R.S. Here we were into a Tent & saw another doctor, who sent us away again, after asking a few more questions. Eventually we were issued into in a Tin Hut holding about 20. Here we we shown to a place on the hard floor to sleep. Very nice quarters for a man with a Temp of 102.6. My pack went astray somewhere while I was at the 5th. Sent a note on to Capt. Nance & asked him to enquire about it.\n","23":" Very restless last night, what with the hard floor, the chats & wondering what had become of my pack. The Orderly took our T’s about 6 a.m. Mine was 100.6 Had Bread & milk for Break. Doctor came round about 10 (Maj. Russell) Took down a few partics. & ordered me to stay in Bed on a light diet. We had no fire in the Hut & it was mighty cold. The 6 F. A are running this place. They only came in a couple of days ago & the place is anyhow. The patients were rushed in on ‘em before they were ready.\n\nSpent a most happy day on the cold hard floor. Nothing to do, nothing to read. Lovelock & Jack Parsons came in during the night. Lovelock was sent to the Conv. Hut. For Dinner we had a little soup & for Tea, a little B’d & Butter & Tea. My underclothing is alive with Big Game & sleep is out of the Question.\n","24":" It’s a big joke to call this a Rest Camp. Everybody is lousy, the orderlies are so rushed with work they cannot tell one the time. There’s no water to have a wash & taking things altogether, this place is perfect Hell. The M.O. ordered me a No 9 & Salts to follow – just because I wasn’t an Anzac. If a man said he was an Anzac, he got his Ticket marked C.C.S. which gave him a good chance of getting to Blighty. The A.D.M.S. came round & sent Lovelock away to C.C.S.\n\nA little soup for Dinner, a little Bread & Butter for Tea, & a couple of visits to the Latrines, make up the days events.\n","25":" This morning the Doc. came round & made me say \"Ah\". I was up of laying about in my lousy clothes & asked him if I could get out. He marked my Ticket Conv. Tent where I moved to immed. after Dinner. I thought I was very unlucky to loose my pack, but there are 3 fellows in this Tent who only have a shirt & pair of Pants, the rest was all taken away from ‘em & they haven’t been re issued yet. At meal times we have to form a que & march into a long brick Barn. The Lord only knows how many men there are at this Camp, but we have to take 3 sittings to get through a meal & what a scramble it is too.\n","26":" Last night we had a fire in the Tent which made things much warmer. Break. was very light. The M.O. came round about 11.30. Told him I was well enough to rejoin my unit, if only I could get a pair of Boots & a few other articles of attire, so he told the Orderly to attend to it. After Dinner went to Q.M. Store & enquired about Boots & found they hadn’t any in stock; so that means I’ve got to stay in this accursed hole a bit longer. They have marked our tickets now for the various sittings for meals. The crowd in our Tent are marked 3rd sitting, \"so the Lord help us\". It is raining & I am paddling about the place in a pair of Bedroom slippers. We pass away most of our spare time in Big Game Hunting.\n","27":" Slept fairly well last night, due no doubt to the fact that before turning in, I murdered 347 chats. They are as numerous as ever though now.\n\nFor Break. we had a minute quantity of Bacon & a drop of cold Tea, using empty Jam Tins as Cups. This sumptuous repast is our reward for standing out in the Rain & mud for about half an hour. Went in search of Boots again, but no luck, so I can’t get away. For Dinner we had some light stew. Took a No. 9, so something should be doing shortly. Issued with another Blanket.\n","28":" Rained heavily early this morning. I had to go out in it & leave my nice warm bed. Glory! got a pair of Boots this morning, so now I can get away.\n\nThis is Dec. 15 & how the dickens I am going to record my doings of the last 6 days, I don’t know, but I must make an effort or my diary will be minus some of the most exciting events since first donning my \"Anzac\". After getting issued with Boots I went down to the Dump & fossicked around for a steel helmet & puttees, which luckily I found\n\nOne puttee was good, but the other had a number of holes burnt in it. After Dinner (which was merely a scramble, the reward being a minute quantity of lightning stew) Jack Parsons & I \"fell in\" with about 40 others ( one lucky beggar being drunk, & made it impossible to \"dress\" the line) & were marched away to the Q.M. Store, where we were issued with 48 hrs rations, Bread, Jam, Cheese, then we were marched to a heap of tents where we quartered for the night. Issued with 2 Blankets, which without a fire, just kept us cold enough to prevent us sleeping. The chats helped to keep our blood circulating. To improve ? matters a rash broke out under my chin, which the orderly smeared over with some tack like dripping & put a bandage round my head. This also received some attention from the chats & prevented me from shaving or having a desent wash. But I must cheer up or this pile of scribbles will read more like a Treatise on \"the Minor Horrors of War\" than an attempt at a Diary.\n\nSun. ","29":" which at Home is \"the Day\". Cold & a drizzling rain. Bacon & plenty of Hot Tea & Bread & Jam for Break. Cheered a man up. After Break. the Serg. Informed us that we were to fall in at 2, & go away with the 2nd div. men to Vignecourt, which was jolly good news. Jack & I took a stroll back to Becordle where I made enquiries about my pack, but am afraid its \"napu\". All my bloomin\" souvenirs & personal nick-nacks \"gone to pot\". Ah well! a man must not growl if he’s been on the Somme nearly 2 mths. & still in one piece. When we returned to our Tent, discovered that our gallant comrades of the 5th Div. had disappeared & with ‘em all the bloomin’ bread, so we had to take a walk into Albert & purchase a couple of Loaves. About 2 p.m. we were issued with B.B. & B & some Bunghole & marched merrily away to Albert Station. Having no gear I donned Parsons pack (containing our rations) so as to look as much like a soldier as possible. Arriving at the station we picked up 7 Reinfts. for the \"Hungry 8th\". 1 Serg. & 6 men.\n\nWe boarded the express at 3.15 & tore away at a hair raising rate towards Vignecourt. The carriage was quite decent & only contained 5. 3 chaps just returning from leave to Blighty & we two; quite a nice little party. We swapped experiences they told of the glorious times spent in \"dear old England\", we of our blissful period in the hands of the \"noble 6th\" One chap distributed 3 Castles Cigttes, another spread a delightful odour of \"Wakons No 10\" every time he opened his mouth, so they made ideal fellow travellers. (Unfortunately, the bottle was empty) The distance from Albert to Vignecourt is about 27 miles & our express? struggled manfully to cover the distance inside 24 hours. \n","30":" At about 2 a.m. whilst we were sprawled across the carriage, attempting to sleep, we were startled by a terrific crash & found that our express had dashed into another express & derailed a truck. At the enquiry it was found that the driver of our express? Had lost control, owing to the fact that he had covered 5 miles during the 4 hrs preceeding the smash. Gallant fellow. Eventually, without further mishap, we arrived at Vignecourt, where we disembarked & marched about 2 miles to where the \"Hungry 8th\" were camped. It was a monastery, before that religious upheaval some years ago, & is now owned by some Army Officer. It is a fine big chateau & plenty of farm buildings attached. Parsons & I reported to the O.R. & were put on \"no duties\" for a week.\n","31":" Slept in till mid-day. Sid Royall brought my Break. up to Bed. It is rotten not having any gear. My face is very rough, but having no brush or soap I can’t shave. A Tommy, in Hospital, gave me an issue razor but I don’t know if it will shave. As soon as we got to our billet yesterday, Payney put on some hot water & I had a good wash & changed all my chatty clothes. Staff. Kitson gave me some cleaned shirts & Payney a pair of slacks, so I dumped my pants as well. It was a great treat to feel clean once more. \"Daunty\" gave me a good feed of fruit & cornflower. So I did very well.\n\nAs soon as I entered the O.R. Alldis handed me some very welcome Letters. \n\n1 each from Mother & Cis, & 1 from M.S. Poor old girl’s got a sore hand. The first Letter she ever wrote me in Pencil.\n","32":" Got up as soon as I had Break. & Blanton put me on to a run into Amiens as Orderly on one of the Cars. There was no time to loose & I had to hop on the Car just as I was & take 5 sick men into No. 1 Stat. Hosp. It is run by N.Zd’s & is right \"up to date\". After discharging my patients took a stroll round the City. It was a dull, cold day & things were not looking at their Best. Went into Hairdressers to get Hair Cut & shave, but after watching the two Frenchmen fool around a couple of French officers, singing their hair & curling their moustaches with hot irons got tired of waiting so cleared out & went into an estaminet & had some light refreshments. Met a Canadian & had very interesting yarn. Ran into Alldis & motor driver\n\nReturned to Hospital, where the N.Zdr’s gave us a good feed. Stew & Rice Custard. After Dinner took stroll round City. Visited Y.M.C.A. Purchased Pipe. Some fine shops, but £s.d. being limited, made no purchases. Electric Trams with women drivers. They wear uniform. Looked very quaint. Not feeling well, was glad to get aboard Car about 5 & return to Camp. Feeling worse, reported to doctor (Maj. Clayton) who ordered me to Bed into Hospital.\n","33":" Slept fairly well but throat very sore. On soft tucker & inhalation. After Break. moved into Hut. Some cow got away with my \"Anzac\". It’s rotten being in Hospital, shall be glad to get out again. Stayed in Bed all day. Tried to write Mrs A.J. but failed dismally.\n","34":" Throat much better. Got up after Break. & had good wash. Still on soft diet. Nothing much doing. Plenty of patients arriving & departing. These Huts are not very warm, much better up in our billet. Stan Wilson is orderly & he looked after me real well. Reg Matthews is in next Bunk & Reg Laycock & 3 others of 8th are also patients\n","35":" When M.O. came round said I could return to my billet if my bunk was required. Sat by the stove & wrote a good long letter to D.O.L. She’ll begin to wonder what the dickens is the matter. Had good feed stew for Dinner. Big rush patients, so had to pack my blankets & return to Billet. Had cocoa for Supper. Quite a treat. \n","36":" Slept in till midday. Got Letter from Nell Sergts Thomson & Roberts & no. of others returned from Hospital. This is a rather dismal part of the country & weather very rough. The poor old Bearers are having a rough time, still out in the Line. Shall be mighty glad to see ‘em again.\n","37":" One week to Xmas. Sent Cable to M.S. Hope this will be the last I’ll spend away from her. Got more mail. 1 letter from Ernest (from S.A.) & 2 from France. Hooray. Spent quiet day. After Tea went into Vignacourt with Reg. Matthews. Not bad little village. Broke my pipe yesterday so bought another from Y.M.C.A. Also had some Biscuits & Tea. Purchased some Post Cards. Went to Picture Show. Pretty good. Got back about nine. Had drink cocoa & went to Bed.\n","38":" Last night Payney & Blanton went into \nBlanton\n Amiens & did not return till about Tea time. Fined 7 days 2nd F.P. Snow on the ground, very cold. Had shave today first one since going to C.R.S. Poor old Jenny, the monk, got her tail smashed today. Staff Hughes operated & removed a few feet of her tail. It’s jolly cold & the only place a man can get warm is between blankets.\n","39":" One day is much the same as another here & there’s nothing to write about. Shall be glad when the Bearers return. They are expected about Sat. so we shall be able to have our Xmas Dinner together. They are making great preparations, tables & forms & packages of good things to eat are arriving daily, so it should be some Dinner. This place is called Olincourt Chateau. The sun actually shone today for a few hours. It was so cheerful that I had a Bath & washed my shirt.\n","40":" O Lord wet again & they call this \"Sunny France\". Jolly good news in the Paper about the French giving Fritz a hiding at Verdun. Got an Anzac today & a pair of Leggings so I’m getting equipped gradually. The fellows who have had leave to Blighty all seem to have had a jolly good time. Shall be glad when my turn comes.\n","41":" The 8th got the worst knock they’ve ever had this morning. Poor old Alec & Nugget Bennet got killed in their dug out. It gave us all a most painful shock. Hughie Taylor of C sec got baldy wounded too.\n","42":" The Bearers returned today & what a sight they looked. Unshaved, unwashed, lowsy, clothes in rags & Poor beggars I felt sorry for ‘em. It was good to se ‘em again & they were mighty pleased to be back. Stan Wright brought back my mail 2 Letters from France & Xmas Cards I from Cis, one each from Kath, Arthur & David. 1 from Nell, Ruth B, Aunt Nell, & 2 glorious long Letters from M.S. & 2 Post Cards. How the deuce I’m going to answer ‘em I don’t know.\n","43":" After Dinner went into Vignacourt with Stan Wright. Went into a cottage & had a good feed of Eggs, Bread & Butter & Coffee. Made few purchases, Post cards etc. After Tea we strolled through the streets. Met Bricky Howard. Adjourned to an Estaminet & drank each others Health in good English Beer. Later on we met David, Russ & the crowd & had a sing song. Returned about 9 p.m.\n","44":" Porridge & milk for Break. For Dinner we had Soup, Rissoles, Plum Pudding, Fruit & actually Beer. I ate until I was ready to burst. The patients had first sitting, then they waited on us. After Dinner they gave out Parcels & what a time we did have. For Tea we had Salmon, Tinned, Fruit, Custard & Jelly. After Tea we had a jolly good Concert. Blanton & party played a little sketch entitled \"Ours or theirs\", which was a huge success.\n\nOur choir then rendered a few items. We quiet expected to be howled down, but they stood us for quite along time. The Col. congratulated us after it was over. Went to Bed feeling tired & full. Wrote to Ruth B. & commenced a Letter to B.E.\n","45":" Finished long letter to M.S. & gave it to Mac to post. Paraded & had kit inspected. Got issued with Leather vest & clean clothes. Cosier & Maj. Wooster returned from Blighty. After Tea the Choir put in an hours practise. They are coming on wonderfully well.\n\nWed.27. Wrote Sister Nell & Aunt Nell. Was Room Orderly & kept very busy. After Tea we had a Concert Com’tt meeting & also Choir Practise. Corp. Matthews & I arranged some patter & things went off real well. If only we can get a Piano, it should be a ding dong Concert. Wrote Letter to C & E. \n","46":" Commenced Letter to M.S. Jack Parsons wrote 11 pages to his B.G. so I must write at least 14 pages to L. Busy arranging details for Concert. Choir getting in good form.\n","47":" Concert keeping us busy. Payney, B. Roberts Clem Matthews, Stan Wright & I went into Vignacourt & purchased material for \"Night birds\" costumes.

More Choir Practise in the morning. Busy fixing stage. Had try out with Piano. Things went off well. More rehearsal at night.\n","50":" The great day at last. Last night things passed off quietly as we were too tired to play up. Sullings was on Cookhouse picket till midnight, so he woke all hands when he came to Bed & made them usher in the New Year. Kept very busy all day making final arrangements. As the time drew near for the Concert to start I got very jumpy, but the show went off wonderfully well. The first part was splendid, but the second half was a bit drawn out. Dodson, as Boko, the waiter, was a scream. After the Show we had a little conviviality behind the scenes.\n","51":" Slept in till about 10. Everyone delighted with the Concert. The Col. wants us to show in Vignacourt for the 5th Div. so we are mighty busy getting things going again. Hooray, Mail came in.

Things going good. Bobby Roberts went into Amiens to purchase material for Ruffles & is busy making them.\n","56":" Went into Vignacourt with Harry Douch & Payney to hear the Div. Band play, but it failed to turn up. Had Feed, Eggs, Bread & Butter. Returned Chateau & spent evening quietly.\n","57":" Wrote Southend & France. Busy in the Pack store helping \"Major\" Payne. Had rehearsal in Officer’s ward. Things going good. Weather rotten.\n","58":" Payney goes on leave tomorrow & I am taking his place in the Pack Store. Plenty patients coming in & keeping us moving.\n","59":" I thought this bloomin’ Pack Store job was going to be easy, but we have been busy moving into another Building, & its anything but a joke to be humping packs around all day. The arrangements for the Concert are going well. Mr Greenberg, Y.M.C.A., came along & asked if we could put on our Show tomorrow night, as the 11th Brig. are moving out on Friday; so that means we’ve got to fly round & make a name for ourselves. The rehearsal went off very well tonight.\n\nThur. 11. Last night wrote few more pages to M.S. Payney & party went away on leave today. The \"Night birds\" left Olincourt at 10, in a Horse Amb. & arrived at Y.M. in Flesselles about 10.45. It is quite a decent little hall with a good stage & our Stage Carpenters, Hargraves & Stan Wilson soon had the place in something like order. Staff Kitson & a party of us went about 2 ½ miles away to get the Piano, which was kindly lent us by the O.C. of an Anti-Aircraft Battery. It was snowing heavily, but we greatly enjoyed the walk.\n","60":" We got back to the Hall just as they were having Dinner, which the Y.M.C.A. had provided. The walk had whetted our appetites & we thoroughly enjoyed the Steak & Bacon & other good things. We had a rehearsal at 2, which went off well, our Pianist (Frank Newton) being in great form. Had Tea at 4, plenty Bread & Butter & Cakes. Then we commenced to make up for the Show, which was billed to start at 6. As soon as the Doors were opened the crowd rushed in & we had a \"Full House\" in double quick time. The show went off splendidly, everyone seemed to be at their Best. Several items were encored. The Sketch also took very well. \"Oriss\" & Madame Melbum taking their parts to Perfection. Billsy May took Payneys place & sung his two songs admirably. The \"Belle of N York\" went off very well too. After the Show, Mr Greenberg complimented us on the Show & said he never expected to see anything near as good. He also gave us Hot Tea & Cakes, before we got aboard the Cars & returned to Olincourt.\n","61":" Busy in the Pack Store all morning. Teddy Wonderful put up a new Rifle Rack for us & one of the Patients fainted & fell on top of it. It collapsed with a crash & greatly upset my Cpl. To make matters worse, a Staff Officer came round on a Tour of Inspection & found our Pack Store in an awful mess. At 3 p.m. the \"Night birds\" departed for Flesselles in a G.S. Waggon. We had Tea & then got ready for the Show. Last night the acting Brigadier & about a dozen other officers were present & spoke very highly of our Show. We got going at 6.30 & the crowd seemed to enjoy it even better that last night. \"Orris\" was in great form, & his antics greatly amused the crowd. We finished about 9 & returned Home in the G.S. waggon, tired & happy. \n","62":" Last night finished Letter to M.S. & posted it We put our show on in the Mess Tent at night & the patients enjoyed it very much. Tomorrow we are returning to \"the Somme\" & the crowd gave 3 hearty cheers for the Bearers. It was read out in orders this morning that 8 of the \n\nprivates are to Lance Jacks from date & my name was among ‘em greatly to my surprise. Mac Dougall is another L. Cpl. He only returned from Blighty this morning. Brought a Parcel back with him & after the show he invited Stan Wright & I to supper, which we greatly enjoyed.\n","63":" Had to get up a bit earlier this morning to prepare for the Road again. Fell in at 9.30 & were issued with Iron rations also 48 hrs. rations to carry us on our Journey. Before we left the Col. made a nice little speech wishing us \"God speed & a safe return\" & the crowd sent us off with 3 hearty cheers. Les Townshend sung out \"3 Cheers for the Roan\" which we gave with great gusto. After about an hour’s march through about a foot of snow we boarded the Train at Flesselles Station The snow fell all night & looked very pretty on the roofs of the Houses & on the trees & was a novel sight to many of the crowd. We travelled 10 in a Carriage, which made us very crowded. After about 4 hours run in the train we arrived at Beure where we disembarked & marched through the Town on to Ribemont where we camped in what looks like an old Brewery.\n\nThe 14th F.A. were already there. We are billeted in a loft, about 20 of us, which is very draughty & cold. \"Mac\" shouted a bottle of Champagne to celebrate his promotion.\n","64":" Couldn’t sleep last night, as it was so jolly cold. Wrote France & Mother Sent France Birthday Card. No duties. So after Dinner, Mac, Stan Wright & I walked into Buire about 3 miles away, & had a look round the Town. There were hundreds of German prisoners working on the Roads. They all look well fed & are quite cheerful. We can hear the boom of the Guns again quite distinctly. Went to Bed early, as there is nothing doing in the village & it’s too jolly cold to mess around. This loft is awfully cold & draughty, & Mac & Wrighty & I huddled together in a heap to try & get warm.\n","65":" Wrote M.S. Letter No 4.\n\nFell in at 9 & after standing around for about an hour in the snow, were dismissed. This is an old Flour Mill where we are billeted. There is a waterwheel near by & the noise of the water rushing over the wheel sounded just like the surf at Manly. After Tea we went to a Show organised by the Aust. Comforts Fund. They had a fine big hall & the 13th Band to play at intervals; but their show was absolutely rotten. Colley, Priest, Mac, & Stan Wright also went & they also had the same idea as myself that the \"Night birds\" was far better in every way.\n","66":" Glory: reveille at 6. A foot of snow on the Ground & more coming down. It was mighty cold turning out, but it had to be done. We fell in at 9 & marched away at 9.30 The country looked very pretty, but it was sloppy under foot & made the walking most unpleasant. \n\nFrance’s Birthday\n\nWe arrived at Becordel about 12.30 & B sec are camped in the same tent that we were in last time. Our blankets were carried on the waggons, which made our loads much lighter to carry. The 16th are still in charge of the Rest Camp & the 5th are still across the road. We got some hot Tea & had Dinner with the Rations we had carried. The Guns are banging away merrily & we are going a bit closer to them tomorrow. Got long Letter from Ruth B\n\nMurphy, Townshend, Lancaster, Sgt. Roberts & went away on leave to Blighty. Lucky Beggars. We went to Bed early as there was nothing doing.\n\nThur. 18. Fritz put a few shells over near us last night just in a friendly sort of way. It was very cold in the Tent & very few of us got any sleep. Reveille blew at 6 & we had Break at 7. Left Becordel at 9.46 & marched through a foot of snow to the A.D.S. at Bernafay Wood.\n","67":" Arrived Bernafay about 1 p.m. We are billeted in Huts about 38 to each hut & they are very crowded. Stan Wright was evacuated this morning. He’s been sick for some time. The roads are very soft & muddy, but considering the amount of traffic, it is wonderful that they are passable at all. We had a Rum Issue at 5, which cheered everyone up, & before going to sleep we had a sing song.\n","68":" Reveille at 7. Break 8. Parade 9. It was jolly cold last night & I slept very little. One good thing, being so crowded helps to keep us warm. 40 of us were told off as a Fatigue Party to work in the Transport Lines, but when we got there no one knew anything about the work or us, so we adjourned to the Y.M.C.A. Hut where we got Biscuits & Tea. The Y.M.C.A. is a great institution & looks after us well, whether in the Firing Line or out of it.\n\nFRI.JAN 19. After Dinner we returned to the Horselines & made a track for the Horses & Wagons through the mud. The poor horses were up to their bellies & the waggons were up to the axles. It was a rotten Job & we were mighty glad when 4 o’clock came so that we could knock off. Rations are very young & we could only rake up half a slice of Bread each for Tea. There are plenty of Biscuits about but Bricky Howard is using them for the Fire. They make good fuel. After Tea we went to the Y.M.C.A. Hut where the 2nd Monmouths gave a good Concert. Returned to camp about 9. Had Issue of Rum & retired.\n","69":" Slept a bit warmer last night, thank the Lord. A sec & part of B went out to R.A.P. after Break. The rest of us were put on duties about the Camp. Fritz put over a good few shots but they kept away from us. Spent the afternoon quietly. Rolled myself in a blanket and commenced to write to M.S. Went to Bed early. Bert Hunt & I put our blankets together & made a double bunk.\n\nSun. JAN. 21. Quite a Busy day. After Break a party of us sorted out some old Tents; & loaded the old stuff from the Salvage Dump on to Waggons. Cleared a space to pitch a Tent for a Pack store. After Dinner we pitched the Tent & carted a lot of old stretchers from the Incinerator to the Dump. Peter Murphy came to see me. He is in the 8th Mac. Gunnrs & looks very well on it. First time I’ve seen him since Egypt. Showed him my snaps & gave him one as I had two alike. 2 of the 14th & 1 of the 15th were wounded today, also one of our horses.\n","70":" Told off last night to go out with a Party to where they are building the new A.D.S. We turned out at 6 & it was jolly cold. Had Break & started off about 7.30. Serg. Jeffreys was in charge. It is about 4 miles away from our Billets & the walk through the frosty air was most enjoyable. From Eskimo Dump the Engineers loaded us with roofing Iron & Timber. We split up into parties of 6 with about 100 yds interval between each party as Fritz drops his shells around pretty strong in these parts. We got out to the A.D.S. about 9.30. Bert Hunt & I with 2","71":" chaps carted duck boards from a dump about a mile away. Had Dinner at 11.30. Couldn’t light a fire as Fritz would have spotted our smoke. While we were eating Fritz dropped about 20 shells all within a 100 yds radius. One dropped on the top of a dugout belonging to the Artillery. It caught one chap in the head & splashed his brains about a bit. Serg. Jeffreys & I went over & fixed him up & Bert Hunt, Sullings, Tom Davis & I pulled him along to the A.D.S. on a trolley. It must be about 5 miles & snowed very heavily. Bomr. Macdonald. 52 Battery. \n\nTues.23. Beautiful sunshiny day. Clear as crystal. Fritz had his aeroplanes up bright & early. Our A.A. Guns gave them a lively reception & brought one down.\n","72":" Frightfully cold & water frozen in the Carts. Had an easy day. Poor old Mac (52 Batty) was evacuated this morning. I had a quiet day. After Tea, just as we were sitting round the Fire, quietly imbibing our rum, when Fritz dropped a number of shells almost on top of us. Evidently his plane had spotted our railway & was feeling for it. If only he knew how close he was to it he would have sent many more shells over in the same place. Our Bombrs got rather too many issues & had to be put to Bed.\n","73":" The 14th came out today & we took their places in the Line. Before going out we went to the Bath House & put our feet through the new process to prevent \"trench feet\". We washed our feet in camphorated soap & warm water, then dusted them with camphor & French chalk. It is very soothing to the feet & is a French idea. Our Party came out to No. 4 Post, past the Batteries. Fritz put over a lot of shells some of which landed very close to us & made us seek cover. One Artillery chap got wounded slightly in the Head & Leg. Maj. Mackenzie fixed him up. We reached A.A.D.S. about 4. There are about 20 of us camped in a Tin Hut & is jolly cold. Serg. Mathieson made us some Tea, which was very welcome as we could not light a fire owing to Fritz’s observation. About 7 Matt. brought round our Rum Issue which we kept by us & took sips of during the night. It was too bloomin’ cold to sleep.\n\nThur. 25. About 5.30 this morning we got a call to take in a stretcher case. His name was Dick Keen, 30 Batt. His arm was blown off & badly wounded in the Leg. He was a big chap, must have weighed about 13 stone. Was delirious & kept trying to get off the stretcher. Poor beggar died before reaching Loading Post. Billgy May, Joy Cotter, Jem Wyatt are in my squad. We got back to our dug out about 7 & went to Bed again. It is frightfully cold.\n","74":" (cont.) This is the Kaiser’s Birthday & our big guns sent him plenty of presents. After Tea his guns returned Thanks. Laddie made us some Tea which was mighty welcome. We are longing for a mail to come in. Its nearly a month since we had any. I wonder how M.S. is going on. Bert Hunt, Billgy May & I had a Tin of Pineapple & Ideal milk, which made quite a Banquet of our Tea.\n","75":" Anniversary Day Back in Sydney the sun is shining & I can imagine M.S. somewhere by the sea in a cool white dress, her eyes reflecting the colour of the sky. Here we are in a Tin Hut, huddled up in our Blankets, trying to get warm. Outside the shells go screaming by in scores. It’s marvellous how few wounded we are getting through. Last night our squad didn’t have a carry. The air is very clear & there are plenty of aeroplanes about, both Friitz’s & ours. We had cold meat for Dinner which was just like eating slices of Ice.\n","76":" Glory: Halleluia! A mail in. I got 9 Letters. 1 each from Cis, Nell, Aunt Nell, 3 from France & 3 from M.S. Wish I had some Green envelopes so that I could write. Last night the 29th Div. hopped over & paid a visit to Fritz’s Lines. Got 120 Prisoners. The Bombardment lasted about 3 hours & shook our hut considerably. One poor chap died as soon as he reached our A.D.S. L. Shoemark 31st Batt.\n\nOur Squad buried him near our dug-out. Wrote Mother & Lill & put them in Billgys Gn. Envelope.\n\nSun. 28. Early this morning the 29th Batt. hopped over, but Fritz spotted ’em & it was a failure. Peter Murphy came through this morning badly wounded in both arms & legs. We fixed him up & gave him a stiff nobbler of Rum. I helped to carry him through & when I left he was quite cheerful. Fritz shelled heavily this morning & a no. of shells lobbed very close. Another plane was brought down but whether it was ours or theirs we don’t know, as it was in flames\n","77":" contd. After Tea a few parcels came along. I got one from France containing socks & a woollen Helmet, just the two things I wanted most. Good old France. Wrote Letter to Kath Williams telling her about poor old Peter.\n","78":" Last night Tommy Ross took on the calling up & I took his place in his squad with Colley, Bill Mac & George Symister. We didn’t have a call all night. This morning Tommy Ross & I tossed up to see who should come out to Thistle Trench. I lost. We came out at 2 oclock. The 53 Batt. are holding this part of the Line & we are in a good deep dug out with the Details, Scotty Sefton & Jim Harrop. They made us some Tea as soon as we arrived & we had a snack. Were just sitting back having a quiet smoke when a chap arrived with a broken arm. We put him on a stretcher & carried him through to Needle Trench where Billsy May & party are. His name was J. Rea. 53 Batt.\n\nWhen we got back to the dugout Scotty made us some more Tea & heated some Pork & Beans & Bully Beef & we had the first warm meal since Dinner time last Wed. Now we are sitting round hoping we don’t get another carry before daylight.\n","79":" Slept soundly & warm till 9.30. Didn’t have a carry all night. \"Praise God from whom all blessings flow\". Got the old \"Primus\" going, made some Tea & warmed a Tin of Pork & Beans. Then I had a shave, which made me feel quite fresh. About Dinner time Fritz set up a terrific Bombardment. Shells were flying in all direction & we got prepared for a busy time. About 2 p.m. the first case arrived, shell wound in the R. Elbow. We carried him thro’ to Needle Trench & when we returned 2 more stretcher cases were waiting. Capt. Cosgrove got some of the 53rd to give us a hand in with ‘em. When we got to Needle Trench\n\nthe Infantry chaps returned to their Batt. & we had to carry right thro’ to No.4 Post. The shells were flying pretty thick & we were jolly lucky that none of us got a \"Blighty\". Things kept moving after this & we were moving backwards & forwards, case after case until about 6 p.m. We got a dozen cases in all, a few were able to walk, luckily for us. When we returned this time we had a feed. To make matters worse the \"Primus\" went bung & we couldn’t make any Tea which was just the thing we had all been looking forward to. After Tea we took the old \"Primus\" to pieces & got her going then we made some Tea, which went down well after waiting so long for it. We sat up till about 9.30, to see if any more wounded came in, then we rolled up in our Blankets & went to sleep. I turned in with Colley & we were soon asleep.\n","80":" About 3 this morning a chap came in from the front line very sick so we made room for him on the floor, which squeezed us together like sardines. Then we slept on again till 9.30, when we got up & had some Break. Cold Bacon & Bread. We gave the sick man some Beef Tea & carried him on to Needle Trench. Fritz put over a severe bombardment & a number of wounded arrived at our R.A.P. which kept us busy till about 4 p.m. Our relief should have arrived about 2, but they had to take cover on account of the heavy shelling, which made ‘em late. Several times my wind was up & once a shell burst about 20 feet away from us. Gee! The narrowest squeak I ever had. The 4 of us dropped to the Ground like one man & we heaved a big sigh of relief when none of us were hit. It was about 5 miles to Bernafay & we were all jolly pleased to get back to Camp as we were tired out.\n\nThe Cooks had a good feed of stew awaiting us which we devoured with relish, then we had our Rum Issue & turned into our Blankets.\n","81":" Turned out about 8 & had Breakfast. Then was told off as Picquet Corporal. At Dinner time we got word that a Cpl. had to go out in charge of a party at the new A.D.S. Bert Hunt & I tossed for it. I, of course, lost & had to come out. We got out about 4. I met Sgt. Stevenson on the way out & he informed me that the","82":" Cpl had been drunk on Rum for the last 2 days & no work had been done. The A.D.S. is finished & now we have to go about a mile further on to Cow Trench where they are building another A.D.S. It was too late to start work so we just made ourselves comfortable, had some Tea & sat round the Fire.\n\nAbout 5 a sapper came along & informed me that Capt. Farquar of the 8th Engrs. wanted to see me down at Eskimo Dump, so I went down. Maggs & Bowden came with me. On our way we called in at the Soup Kitchen & had a drink of Hot Soup. Saw the Capt. who gave new instructions about the work we are to do. On our way back we were almost deafened by the noise of our Guns, which were putting over a Barrage into Fritz’s lines as some of our fellows are going over on a Raid. We were mighty glad to get back to our A.D.S. where we had a nip of Rum & soon got between our Blankets. Our Guns quietened down after a couple of Hours then Fritz had ago & we couldn’t get to sleep until the early Hours of the morning.\n","83":" Rations are very scarce on this Job. We finished what little we had for Tea last night, so this morning we slept in till about 10 when the rations arrived. They only sent enough for 3 meals & we are one meal short. After Dinner Maggs, Bowden, & I took a walk out to Cow Trench, to see what the Job was like. I arranged to send out a Party of 4 men to work with the sappers. There is a smashed up aeroplane near our A.D.S. & a bit further over a Tank, which has either been struck by a big shell or blown up by her own crew. I looked inside it. It was most interesting. There were still a number of shells inside her but they were jammed in the racks or I would have brought one away as a souvenir. The first party left here at 7.30 last night & returned about 3 this morning.\n\nSat. 3. Turned out about 7 this morning roused the 2 working parties & lit a fire. Rations are still very young & all that I could give the lads for Break. was some warmed up bully beef, Biscuits & Tea. Now we are waiting on the rations so that the rest of us can have some Break. About 10 Reg Sutton came out with our Rations which we were mighty glad to get. We turned to & cooked a bit of tucker & had a good feed. Then I put some Ice on to melt & had awash & shave. Was just getting settled down to write a letter to B.E when a party of the 15th arrived to take over the new Aid Post. We had to turn out of some of the places to make room for em’. After Tea an Engineer officer came round & asked a few things about the Job. A shrapnel burst over his & he went away in rather a hurry.\n","84":" Got up about 7, lit the fire & cooked Break. for the crowd going out. Rations were still very young so & I went into the A.D.S. & saw Sgt Stevenson who fixed us up with rations to make up our shortage, but even now we are one meal out. After a look round the Camp we loaded ourselves up with the rations & started back to the A.A.D.S. On our way back we passed some of the Battns at Church Parade. A Band was playing the Hymns & it sounded very fine in the frosty air. A number of Taubes were up & our A.A. Guns banged away at ‘em. About 3 p.m. our rations arrived on the Cart. We actually got one loaf to each 2 men which was the best rations we had been issued with for a long time. We had a fire in our Hut which kept us quite warm.\n","85":" Glory Halleluyah: a mail in. I got 2 Letters from France & some Papers, 1 from Mother & 1 from M.S. Everything going good. Poor old France is sick. Hope she soon gets right again. Wish to the Lord I could write as I owe an awful lot of Letters. One party went out to Cow Trench this morning, but took the wrong track & got out to the front line. Fritz puts plenty of shells over this way, but our crowd continues to be lucky. Capt. Bullen (15th) told us he required some of the Huts we were occupying, so we had to clear out & look for new quarters. We eventually found some old Artillery dugouts, they are not too comfortable, but \"any port in a storm\". The weather is fearfully cold & we appreciate out nightly issue of Rum.\n","86":" We are only occupying one Hut at the A.D.S. now & today got orders to move, so I saw Capt Farquar, the Eng. Chief & explained things to him. He said there was room for us at Waterlot Farm where the Engineers are Camped, so we packed up our Gear & moved into a Big Tin Hut which holds 20 men. I am camped in a dugout next door with 6 of the Engineers. They have a stove there & it keeps the place nice & warm. After seeing the sapper party off at 9.30 I went to Bed.\n","87":" Yesterday Serg. Morris came along to see if we wished to be relieved. Of course everybody said \"Yes\", as it is no joke to go 14 days without a hot meal. About 10 a.m. I went back to Bernafay to arrange for a cook to be sent out. When I arrived Serg. Jeffreys informed me that the Col. had sent in for me to go back to Bellevue Farm & take part in a Concert. Bert Hunt was told off to take my place in charge of the Fatigue Party. I had Dinner with Billy May Roy Knowles & party. After Dinner I went out with Bert to explain the working parties etc. Then I packed my gear & went to Bernafay. Boarded the Hospital Train about 8. Arrived Becordel about 9.30 & walked on to Bellvue Farm, about 2 miles. Arrived there about 10.30. Slept in the Cook’s Tent with Jack Kitson. The Concert had come off that night, so I was too late.\n","88":" Slept soundly till about 9 a.m. when one of the Cooks brought my Break. to me in Bed. Buttered Toast, Tea & Bacon which was quite a Banquet after doing 14 days in the Trenches.\n\nPoor old McDougall was evacuated with piles just before I left. Stan Wright is working in the Orderly Room & is quite well again. This Rest Camp is quite a big concern, carry well over a thousand patients. I quiet expected to be sent back to the Line again, but Major Bond informed me that he had a Job for me here, for which I am not sorry. We are arranging another Concert & tonight we held the first meeting. The last Concert was not too successful as most of the crowd had bad colds (especially Bobby Roberts) & they took strong doses of Mist. Tussi, which made them feel a bit \"off colour\". Hock Douch arrived back from Blighty just in time to take part in the Concert.\n","89":" Lill’s Mother’s Birthday.\n\nThis morning Serg. Fry put me in charge of the Blanket Store, which is a sweet Job. I’m hoping to get time to write a few Letters now. Last Thursday I got a lovely parcel from Lill, containing just the blooming things I most wanted. Good for you L.A. It’s a treat to get a bit of decent tobacco again. I made a Table & fixed up the Store, making it as snug as possible as I have to sleep there & also take my meals. Jimmy Whip is going to sleep here also to keep me company. After Tea we had a rehearsal & things went off fairly well. Commenced a Letter to M.S. The weather is fine & clear, but very cold. The nights are almost as light as day & a Fritz plane comes over every night & drops a few bombs. They call him \"Midnight Charlie\".\n","90":" Kept busy in Blanket Store. Weather still frosty. Finished Letter to M.S. Concert Party going strong, but most of the crowd got very bad colds.\n","91":" Went into Albert with 2 G.S. waggons & drew 1000 Blankets from the 7th F. Amb. Plenty of Patients arriving & departing which keeps me busy in the Store. Church Service in the Concert Room till 7.45. Made our Night birds rehearsal rather late.\n","92":" Reg Hancock & Murphy were evacuated today. About half the Amb. are sick in Hospital. Got some more mail today. One Letter from Kath, one from Mother & one from D.O.L. Horrie Playford came along with his Cornet so now we have quite a first class orchestra, Violin, Piano, & Cornet\n","93":" Quite an exciting day. Early this morning a number of Taubes came over & dropped bombs, but didn’t do much damage. Just after Dinner a Patient was having a shave in the Barbers shop, when he collapsed, seriously wounded. The pack store is next door. A chap was cleaning a rifle there, when it went off & the poor beggar in the shop got the bullet thro’ his arm & made a big hole in his side. Of course there will be an enquiry & somebody will get into trouble. The Concert is going good, but my partner, Blanton is suffering from Trench feet & can’t jig about at all. I wrote out some Programmes today put a sketch of an owl in one Corner, & it looks very well.\n","94":" Jacko came to see me today. He is working with the Engineers. Full of news, as usual. Arthur Bedbrook also called in. Its the first time I’ve seen him since we were kids. Had a great old yarn. Wrote to Kath (Essendon).\n","95":" Got a Letter from Peter Murphy today. He is in Hospital at Reading & getting on very well indeed. Peter Hutchison is in Hospital here. He looks very sick. Had Dinner with me. Baked Rabbit & Strawberries & Cream. Not too bad. Went away to C.C.S. after Dinner. Wrote to France. Concert going good. Poor old Blanton came to rehearsal on Crutches. Got trench ft. H. Hargraves our \"props\" has made us a bonser\" motor car for our Concert.\n","96":" Weather much warmer. Payney went into Amiens to purchase things for the Concert. Commenced Letter to B.E. Concert going good. Busy all day making our Programmes. Voices not up to much, everybody suffering from a cough or cold.\n","97":" Finished Letter to M.S. & posted it. Miserable day. Raining. Roads getting quite sloppy again. Quite a number of the 8th are in Hospital. S.L. \n","98":" Church service in Rec. Hut. General clearance of Patients who are swinging the Lead. Things quite lively in the Blanket store. Had to get an assistant. Had good rehearsal at night. \"Oris\" continues to smile although his feet are still sore. Hargraves is putting in some good work fixing up the Stage.\n","99":" Raining like blazes. Mud up to ones knees again. Things lively. Getting rid of all the old Hands from the Rest Camp. It’s about time we had another mail in seems ages since I last got any Letters.\n","100":" Hargraves has fixed up the stage quite sumptuously so it should be some show Tomorrow.\n","101":" We discovered at the last moment that our Programme was very short, so the evergreen \"Spanish Onion\" is included in the Show. The Hall was packed to overflowing as soon as the doors opened. Everything went off tip top. It’s quite the best show we have put on yet. Every item went off without any little hitch. After the Show Mont of the 5 Div. Show congratulated us & said it was the brightest little show he had seen for some time. We had Supper & a little liquid refreshment & the night finished up excellently.\n","102":" Owing to so many not being able to secure seats we are putting the Show on again on Sat. night. We are fumigating all the Blankets & it is keeping us busy. The rain makes things sloppy & miserable.\n","103":" M.S. will begin to wonder what’s gone wrong. Hanged if I can find time to write at all lately. Eric Herford is sick so Hock Douch is going to sing \"Broken Doll\", which is one of our best items. Busy rehearsing again. Things going good.\n","104":" The sun actually shone for a while this morning. The roads are very muddy again & it makes things very rough for Traffic. Our Concert went off very well again. Hargrave, our \"Props\" is always surprising us with something new. His latest is to telephone over to Stan Wilson, when to raise the Curtain. Col Shepherd is away on leave, so he missed both our Concerts. Lucky beggar, this is his 2nd trip over to Blighty.\n","105":" Glorious sunshiny day. Makes me wish I was at Manly with M.S. Must write to her today, or I’ll be getting into trouble.\n","106":" Busy preparing for our Concert.\n","107":"\n","108":" Busy day of course, because our Concert is coming off tonight. MacKinlay took 400 Blankets to be fumigated & another 300 were dumped inside my store just as I was getting ready to go out. The Show went off very fine. Crowded House\n","109":" We repeated our Show at the Church Army Hut & it was even a greater success than last night. \"Oris\" was brilliant & kept the crowd in roars of laughter.\n","110":"\n","111":" Busy day in Blanket Store. Got 2 patients to assist me & we put in some good work. After Tea went to see","112":" Div. Concert in the Church Army Hut. They used our Stage & Hargrave assisted. Wrote long Letter to M.S.

About 40 of the 8th with Maj. Wooster & Capts. Irving, Catford & Riley marched to Edgehill & attended the funeral of Col. Williams. It was a very simple ceremony & he was put in a trench just the same as a Private. The Night birds\" got another knock tonight. Bob Roberts is going to the Anzac Show, so we are left without a Producer.\n","114":" Archie Deed is assisting me in the Blanket Store. They are tossing the Patients out wholesale & we are crowded out with Blankets. Had a rehearsal after Tea. Bobbie Roberts was coming to give us a hand but he was taken sick.\n","115":" Got some new songs for our Show also a new opening Chorus which is some class.\n","116":" Heavy Frost. Jolly cold. There is a rumour going round that Leave is starting again. Hope to the Lord its true.\n\nFri. Mar. 9. Went out to Meaulte & put our Show on in the Y.M.C.A. Hut. \"Props\" Hargraves went over about mid-day & fixed up the stage. Sgt. Major Scanlan of the 2nd D.A.C. the M.T’s (Empties) had made arrangements for us & the show went off A.1. The Col was there & enjoyed it very much. The Building was packed. After the Show the D.A.C. took us to their Camp & gave us a Banquet in their Sergeant’s Mess.\n","117":" (continued) \n","118":" \n","119":" The \"Night birds\" made anew departure today. At the request of the Padre we lead the singing in the sick ward for service. Johnnie played his violin & we sang the Hymns.\n","120":" Went into Albert to see Bobby Roberts first appearance with the Anzac Coves\". His turn took very well. Then we returned to our Rec. Hut & had a rehearsal Got Letter from M.S.\n","121":" Snowy\" Hargraves went away today to Bernafay & Jack Edgar is taking his place as \"Props\". He is busy making an aeroplane & tools for our Barber’s Shop Scene.\n","122":" Small mail in. Got note from Bank today. M.S. had wired me £5. Good old S.H.\n","123":" Party of 20 Bearers went out to Bernafay. Heard today the our troops had entered Bapaume. Hooray! \n","124":" Feeling very crook Our Concert came off tonight but I was too sick to appear. Things went off well, but Ted Jane got tied up in a knot & failed to get out. It was very interesting to hear the opinions of the patients, as none of them were at all aware that I was interested in \"the Nightbirds\"\n","125":" Spent a day in Hospital A chap named Stevens is in this ward. He used to be in the Manly Band, & he & I had some great yarns about Manly.\n","126":" Good news from Bapaume. Our troops have the Town & several villages beyond & Fritz is still on the move. It seems strange not to hear the Guns banging away. They are too far away now to hear them firing. Went to see the Anzac Coves with Ted Grey & MacKinlay Very good show.\n","127":" Our well has gone dry, so the Baths had to close down, as we had no water. We are rehearsing for a Concert on Sat. night.\n","128":" Put on to assist Geo. Hand in the Convalescent Hut. Kept busy supplying men for the different Fatigues about the camp.\n","129":" Weather getting good again. Quiet a treat to be alive. Busy getting ready for the Concert.

Our Concert is put off till Monday night, as the \"Anzac Coves want to see it.\n","131":" Jack Kitson resigned from \"the Nightbirds\".\n","132":" Final rehearsal. Things going good. Fritz still going back. I wish he would go right back to Germany so that we could get back Home.\n","133":" Major McKenzie discharged about 50 Patients yesterday, but we are nearly full up again. The Concert came off & was pretty good, but not so good as the show we put on in Albert & Meault. Norm Adams made us some new ruffles which looked very well indeed. Nick Coxon appeared as Melba & did very well. Heard today that the Bapaume Town Hall had blown up & caught some of the Comforts Fund people who were arranging for a Concert to be held there. \n","134":" Yesterday wrote Lill & today to Mother & \nArthur\n David. Wet, windy day. \n","135":" Hospital ship \"Asturias\" sunk by the Huns. Another wet day.\n","136":" Still got the Huns on the move.\n","137":" Went into Albert with Billy Williams & had a good look round the Town. Quite a number of civilians have returned & the place is looking quite civilised. Got Letter from Ruth B.\n","138":" Some H.Q. Staff has moved into Albert & the Town is full of Red Caps. One has to be careful about saluting these days.\n","139":" Last night we had quite a full house. 3 of our Sergeants & 4 of the 15th camped in our Hut & kept the place lively till all hours. \n\nThis morning they went away to an officer’s School. After Tea George Hand & I went into Albert again & had a \"petit \" . It is most amusing. For ½ Franc we get a Pork & Beans tin of Beer & for un franc we get a Butter Tin Full. The Town is full of Tommies. It’s rotten not getting any mail. We are beginning to wonder what’s gone wrong. I commenced a Letter to France, but I’m hanged if I know what to put in it.\n","140":" Cold bleak wind. About midday is snowed very heavily. Last night a Fritz plane came over & dropped a bomb in the Town. Evidently they are after H.Q. but they missed badly & did no damage whatever.\n\nTonight we got some new Music from Blighty, so now we can go ahead with a new Programme.\n\nPoor old M.S. I wonder if she is getting my Letters alright, I hope so.\n\nTues. \nMar\n","141":" The Y.M.C.A. Hut manager sent in today to know if we would put on our Show on Thursday night, so we are busy now arranging a Programme.\n","142":" Good news in the Paper at last. America coming in the War. So now we are hoping that Fritz will throw up the sponge & let us get back to Sunny New South. Hooray. Mail came in. Got 3 Letters from M.S. Now I can write a decent Letter in return. The Prince of Wales attended the Anzac Show in Albert. Bob Roberts offered to put us in the seat among the Heads, but we have a rehearsal on, & I can’t afford the time.\n\nThurs. \nMar\n","143":" Commenced Letter to M.S. Glorious day, sun shining gloriously. Plenty of planes about. George Hand went into Amiens, so I was left to run the Show.\n\nJohnnie Moore also went to Amiens & failed to return. Horrie Playford & Wally Saunders did not like to go on without him, so Freddy Saunders had the Piano to himself. He did very well too. Everything went off very well & the crowd was most appreciative.\n","144":" Our Bearers came back from the Trenches today where they have been following up old Fritz. We are putting on a Concert tomorrow night & we had a rehearsal tonight, so as to give ‘em some of our best.\n","145":" Yesterday the Frenchmen on the Farm killed a big pig, to give the Bearers some pork; but when our cook inspected it, he discovered it to be an old sow about 90 years of age; & too tough to chew; so Pork was off. Johnnie Moore went into Amiens & purchased a big supply of good things. The Banquet was gorgeous & our Concert was thoroughly enjoyed by the Bearers.\n\n ","146":" Lovely day. After Dinner Dodson & I went into Baupaume. We got a lift in a motor Lorry. It was most interesting the whole way out. Fritz left hundreds of tons of Barbed wire behind & a huge stack of coal. On the roadside we saw a whole train, about 20 or 30 trucks, which our guns had blown off the Line. We also counted 7 tanks which Fritz had \"knocked out\". The country is just like a Honeycomb, shell holes joining up to one another. We saw MacCallum in Bapaume. He is acting as detail to the 31st Batt. I asked one of the traffic police where the Town Hall was. He looked a bit surprised & pointing to a vacant piece of ground said \"That’s where it was.\" The Huns certainly made a Job of blowing it up. \n\nEaster Sunday The cemetery is a very interesting place. Fritz went to some trouble in planting flowers & making the graves look nice. They also had some very nice stones to some of the Graves; especially the officers. They had one of our airmen buried with some of their men & his name was painted on the stone in English. There is a very fine statue that Fritz erected in memory of their men who fell in the taking & holding of Bapaume. After a stroll through the Town we got aboard a Motor Lorry & returned to Bellevue Farm.\n","147":" \n","148":" \n","149":" \n","150":" \n","151":" \n","152":" \n","153":" \n","154":" \n\nToday I packed up some souvenirs & sent to ArThur. Had a good rehearsal tonight. Things going good.\n","155":" Got Letter from Aunt Nell.\n","156":" Our Concert came off at 7 p.m. The Mess Hut was packed about 600 or 700 there. The lady on the Farm lent Payney some clothes to wear in the Sketch; & she & her little girl Susan came to the Show. They laughed very much & enjoyed themselves, although they wouldn’t understand a word we said. The Anzac Concert Party were there & said it was a very good show.\n","157":" Glory: Got 6 more Letters today. 1 each from Mother, France, Sam Ibbs, & 3 from M.S. I’ll be kept busy answering them now. Started one to B.E. Its very nice to get a Letter from Ibbsy, after such a long interval. Good news in the Papers.\n","158":" Finished my Letter to Lill Got a new Anzac from \"Dados\" in Albert.\n","159":" Went to see the Anzac show in Albert, but there were only 2 turns on, the rest being Pictures. Not much chop.\n","160":" Fine day. Plenty of planes about. Ted Grey returned from leave after having a good time in Blighty. Johnnie Moore went away today. Hock Douch went to C.C.S with appendicitis.\n","161":" Another fine day. A Taube came over just after Dinner & 6 of our planes on their way back from Fritz’s line met him. Goodbye Fritz\n\nWe are trying to arrange a Concert for Anzac Day the 25th but the Transport are going out op the Line so our orchestra is very weak.\n","162":" Major Bond sent in to know if we could put our Show on at Mametz Wood to the 15th Brigade; but things are very awkward at present.\n","163":" Anzac Day\n\nFred Saunders sprained his Leg, while playing football, so was not able to go out with the Transport. Now we can put on our Show. Last night Maj. Clayton sent Eric Herford, Bill Bailey & I out to Mametz to see Maj. Bond & arrange for a Show. We are going there on Sat. night. \n\nSent parcel of souvenirs Home to Lill Our Show went off fairly well but not near so well as last Wed’s Show. Commenced writing to M.S.\n","164":" Yesterday there were Sports held at most Camps & Anzac Day was kept up in good style.\n","165":" Cloudy & cold wind blowing. Got another Glorious Letter from D.O.L. That Girl is a marvel. She’d cheer the heart of the Kaiser himself. Finished off my Letter to B.G. & posted it.\n\nFootball match between \n\nPossibles – nil & Probables – 9pts\n","166":" Dodson, Bayliss & Nash went away on Leave this morning, which makes me 8th on the List now. After Dinner we found that no wagon was obtainable to take us to Mametz; so rang up Major Bond who promised to send along some vehicles. About 3 p.m. Normy Adams, Jack Edgar & Stan Wilson left, with our \"Props\" in a Tip dray. At 6 p.m. the remainder of the \"N.B.s\" left some in a Limber & the others in a Maltese Cart, both from the 59th Batt. \n\nThe Y.M.C.A. Hut was crowded & our Show went off tip-top. Maj. Bond greeted us on our arrival. Maj. Clayton & Capt. Riley were also there. After the Show, Mr King of the Y.M.C.A. & the Padre gave us a slap up Feed, Fried Sausages Bread & Butter, Cakes & Cocoa. After that Maj. Bond took us up to the officers’ Mess & produced some Fire Water. The officers of the 59th are a jolly decent crowd & they gave us a good time. Plenty of Whisky & actually Schweppes Soda. I’m glad to say that our Crowd played the Game & arrived back Home at midnight quite alright.\n","167":" Glorious, sunshining day. Our crowd are football mad. They have played 2 or 3 games a day lately but have lost every one. Maggs, Wally Saunders, & a no. of others are suffering from Injuries & today our W.O. Roberts was admitted to Hospital with a sprained ankle.\n","168":" Commd Letter to M.S. Beautiful sunshining day. Plenty of planes about. After Tea we had a rehearsal to prepare for our Show at the Y.M.C.A. Hut in Albert. Staff Kitson returned from Blighty. He says he had a glorious time & that he failed to notice any Food Shortage in England.\n","169":" Typical May Day. Nice warm & sunny. Our Show in Albert was almost a dud. First of all the Gas Pipe Burst & set fire to the stage; then half way through the 1st half the lights went out & we had to use candles. Eric Herford forgot his words in \"Who killed Kaiser\" & I did the same. Payney & Bill May were in good form & Bill Gamble was quite brilliant. The 2nd Part went well & the Sketch went screamingly . The Y.M.C.A. people gave us a Good Supper after the Show.\n","170":" Another glorious day. Our Tug o’ War Team pulled against the 15th to see who should pull in the Div. Sports on Friday on Sat Bricky, Bill Williams & I went into Albert after Tea. It was quite a treat to be among civilians again.\n","171":" Finished my letter to M.S. \n\nThis morning our figures for the Con Camp were incorrect, so we spent the morning fixing them up. After the 2 o’clock parade we got busy & scrubbed our Hut out.\n","172":" It’s about time another mail was in. After Dinner, Bill Williams, Nick Coxon & I walked out to Mametz to the Div Sports. It was a very warm day & I actually raised a sweat, the first one since I came back from the Line. There was big crowd there & the events went off very well. \"Billgy\" May & \"Shag\" Shearer came 2nd in the Stretcher Bearer’s race, they should have got first, but failed to do some little item & lost points. Our Q.M. McFadyon won the Officer’s Race – flying & Tommy Ross & Les Foote won the 3 legged Race. We came away at about 4, got a lift in a Motor Lorry part of the way, & had a glass of Beer & a good Bath when we arrived back at Bellvue Farm.\n\n.\n","173":" Capt. Riley fixed up my Tooth. Last night we had a meeting in the Mess Hut to decide about giving a Show at the Reinf. Camp. Fred Winter, Charley Hall & Capt Marshall went on leave.\n","174":" Glorious day. The Trees are bursting into bloom & look very pretty. The news from then front continues good, but the slaughter must be terrible on both sides. After Tea Bill Williams & I went for a stroll along the Becordel Road & came across a big crowd of Reinf. On their way to the Front Line. They looked in the Pink of Condition.\n","175":" Last night we had quite settled down to Bunk when Sgt Thomson came & sung out the names of 100 Bearers to be ready to move off at a moments notice & my name was among ‘em. It appears that the casualties among stretcher Bearers is very high & we have to go out to relieve them. After Tea we had a run through our Programme for tomorrow night at the Reinf Camp.\n","176":" Our Concert is knocked on the Head. The 15th F. Amb is coming to relieve us tonight & our crowd are taking over the Main & Advanced Dressing Stations.\n\nLater. Busy Day packing up & handing over. Payney, Nick Coxon Jack Edgar & I had a Farewell Gathering in the Mess Hut.\n","177":" Got up bright & early & fell in at 8.30. Packed up & fossicked around for Rations. Had Dinner at 11.30. Payney, Bricky & I dined in the Canteen. Fell in at 12.30, boarded motor Lorries & came out to this Main dressing Station, through Poziers & Bapaume. The country looks much better than it did on my last visit as the grass has grown & covered up the shell holes to a certain extent. We got a drink of Tea & are to bivouac in the open for tonight & move up to the Line tomorrow. There are plenty of planes about & its good fun watching ‘em.\n\nGlory Halleluyah! Got 3 Letters 2 from M.S. & 1 from Nell Good old Blue Eyes. Your Letters bucked me up fine.\n\nThur. May 10. Last night was quite exciting. We had quite settled down to sleep when bang! came about a dozen Fritz shells. Just got settled down again when the Serg. rushed in & told us to put on our Gas Helmets as the wind was favourable for Fritz. I was sleeping between Bricky Howard & Prescott. Bricky slept peacefully through it all. Prescott suffered from nightmare & sung out in his sleep \"Oh, this war, this awful war!\" Altogether it was a most eventful night. 18 of our chaps, Billy May, Snowy Atherton Towney, Ross, Stan Wright among them went out to the A.D.S. about 8 o’clock. This morning we pitched Tents & unloaded waggons. It is quite hot & the crowd are getting quite tanned.\n\nFritz had a Balloon up & soon sent a number of shells around our Camp. Several motor Lorries were coming along the road & the way they broke the speed limit was real amusing. About 20 men got knocked & we had a busy time for a few hours. A 2nd Division Transport sergeant was killed. Hippersly was at work in the Cookhouse when a lump of shrapnel came through & hit him on the Leg. Three motor Amb. were smashed up & had to be towed to the workshop. We fell in at 5 o’clock for Gas Helmet inspection & after fooling around till nearly 8, we set off for the Line. Stan Wright, Billgy May & party at the A.D.S. made us some cocoa which we greatly appreciated.\n\n \n","178":" (cont)\n\nWe arrived at the R.A.P in the sunken road about 8 p.m. & reported to Major Bond. Two squads failed to turn up & we waited for them an hour or so before moving on to relieve the others. Our Squad, (Bricky, Howard, Johnnie Maggs & Nigger Bowden & I) went out to Left R.A.P. with 3 other squads & relieved the 1st F. Amb. We had a good dug out which held 2 squads nicely. Reg Sutton, Arthur Butler, Sam Wallace & Wynn Arthur were the other squad. \n\nThings were fairly quiet & we didn’t get a case till about 2 a.m. on \n","179":" \n\nJust as we were about to start off with our case Fritz put over his Barrage & the M.O. of the 59th told us to wait awhile till he slowed down a bit. About 2.30 we started off. Fritz continued to shell heavily, but we were lucky & got through to the relay Post without damage. Fritz kept on putting his big stuff over & the cases arrived just quick enough to keep us on the move. Harry Lambdon got a crack on the hand just before we arrived at the R.A.P. which made his squad short. Dick Scholer, Dick Kenna, & Armstrong were the other 3. About 10 or 11 a.m. Fritz dropped a shell just outside our dug-out & gave Scholer a crack on the Head. He went away smiling. That left his squad with 2. Then Dick Kenna took sick & that left one. \n\nThe 58 Batt. were in the front Line & they got it hot & strong. There are thousands of dead lying about & the stench is awful. During the afternoon 2 men got killed in the sap through which we return from the relay Post. It is not wide enough to allow a stretcher through\n\nFriday. May 11. 2 men of the S. Staffords were also hurt, one stretcher & one walking case. Just before it got dark Fritz made things very hot. A big working party of Tommies was going through to the front Line & for an hour or so it was perfect Hell. One big shell landed outside our dugout & put the candle out. Bricky sang out \"Hello! any Blighties\" just as a chap stumbled into our dug-out with a knock on the side of the Head. Sam Wallace got wounded in the leg, while on his way back to the dug-out; which made 3 wounded from our Post. It was a most unhealthy spot & we were mighty pleased when our relief, the 15th arrived about 1 a.m. on Sat. morning. \n\nOnce during the night we got lost & were wandering around with a stretched case for about an hour. I sang out \"Reg Sutton\" & away in the distance Reg replied \"Hello is that you Peter? It was the sweetest voice but one that I ever heard. We got back to the A.D.S. about 3 on Sat. morning. Bricky & I got a lift in a motor Amb. from the A.D.S. to a collecting Post & from there on to our little Home in a motor, with a crowd of sitting wounded. They shelled our crowd out of their old position & they went further back, 2 miles nearer Bapaume. The A.D.S. are in a pretty good place, just outside the village of . It took us some time to find our Packs & Blankets as they were all dumped in a heap. We were jolly tired & soon fixed up a place to sleep. We put down a couple of duckboards & lay down between our Blankets. In minutes we were sound asleep.\n","180":" We woke up this morning to find the sun high up. It was a glorious morning. The sun was shining & the larks singing away quite merrily. Our Camp is in a very pleasant spot. Beautiful green grass & nice shady trees. I had in wash all over & shook my shirt, which was most refreshing. Enjoyed a good feed of stew & a nice drink of Tea. Water is not too plentiful out in the Line, & one has to be very careful. \n\nAfter Dinner I wrote a good long Letter to Lill. The rest of the day I just lolled about & read. A big number of Fritz prisoners passed our Camp this morning. We had quite a casualty list this trip. Beside the three wounded from our Post – Len Palmer, Bill Macdonald, C.B. Arthur & Cambridge were also knocked.\n","181":" Reveille at 6. Break at 7 a.m. At 9 we fell in for Gas Helmet inspection & drew rations. At 9.30 we moved off, through the village of Vausel to the A.C.S. in the sunken Road. We called in at the A.D.S. where our chaps fixed us up with a drink of Cocoa. We also had a drink & a \"bak shee\" cigarette at the Y.M.C.A. which is located in a shell-shattered cottage on the outskirts of the village. Arrived at Maj. Bond’s A.C.S. about 11. The London Regt. is in the dug-outs along the sunken road, some of their Battns. are in the Front Line & supports. We had a feed, then we sat around & waited our turn to go out into the Line. We expected to go out straight away, but did not move out till about 9 at night. 3 squads in charge of Bert Berry to the Relay Post, & the other 3 squads to the Left R.A.P. A Tommy M.O. is in charge. Fritz was shelling heavily. Bob Roberts was in charge of our party.\n\nSun. May 13 (cont) I was odd man out. We drew to see who should take out the first patient, & Maggs, Bowden, \nStan Wright\n Bricky & Lew Ballard drew No 1. Just as they moved off a shell burst almost on top of ‘em & I had to take Magg’s place as he got a bad dose of shell shock. We arrived safely at the relay. On our way back through the sap, Fritz set an aeroplane alight with a shell. It lit the place up as light as day. A good number of men were about & Fritz peppered them hot & strong with shrapnel & H.E. None of our party were hit, but we were mighty glad to get back to our dug-out. Joy Koller, B.W. Howard. Stan Wright & Archie Deed were in the dug-out with us. We were kept going for a time, then things slackened down a bit. It was impossible to get any rest, as our dug-out was small, & the shells kicked up such a deuce of a row, so we had a feed.\n\nTowards daylight the wounded began to arrive & we were kept going the whole time. Fritz kept up a terrific barrage & it was really marvellous that none of us got hit. Stan Wright got hit in the arm with a piece of shrapnel. We took his tunic off to examine him. His tunic & shirt were torn & on his arm was a little scratch. Shag Shearer, Armstrong, Bluey Stanton & Jack Bain were No. 3 squad. They were in another dug-out with Bob Roberts. Fritz kept up his Barrage all day & the place was a perfect Hell; but as there was no shelter for the poor devils who got wounded, we had to carry them through & trust to Luck. We always returned along the sap, but it was impossible to carry a stretcher through, as it was too narrow. During the afternoon 3 poor devils who were working in the sap were blown to pieces. From the end of the sap to our dug-out was about 100 yds. & we used to cover it in about 9.3\/5\n\nSun\n","182":" During one of the Fritzs Barrages Stan Wright & about 6 others failed to get through. After waiting about 3 hours, we almost decided to go & search for them, when they turned up. It was a great relief to see them. The 15th came & relieved us about 7 oclock & never was a body of men more welcome. We arrived safely back at the A.C.S. in the sunken Road, where we found that instead of having a spell, we had to carry through to the Waggon loading Post. \n\nThere were a great many wounded coming through & we were kept busy. About 9 oclock, 4 g.s. waggons came along the Sunken Road & commenced to unload Gas Cylinders. Fritz was sending over a barrage of H.E & shrapnel. Over in the Gully, near the village of Noreuil our Batteries were banging away & Fritz couldn’t get ‘em. One of the Gas Waggons was standing just outside the A.C.S. About 9 a shell landed right behind one of the Horses. It didn’t explode & we all thought it was a dud; till somebody shouted out \"Gas\". Then it was a rush to get our Gas Helmets on. Maj Bond kept his head well. There were a good number of wounded lying about & these had to fixed up with Helmets. The Heads reckon that about 5 thousand Gas shells came over during the night.\n\nMonday. May 14th We had about an hours spell towards midnight & a drink of Rum, which put new Life into us. When we arrived\n","183":" \n","184":" Slept in till about 10. Nigger Bowden brought in Breakfast to Bed. Then I rolled over & had another sleep. Got up about 11.30 & had a wash, just in time for Dinner. Spent the afternoon quietly. Got a new pair of Australian Boots from the Q.M.Store; also a Pipe. Now I can enjoy a smoke of Mothers Tobacco. There is a Canteen near here so we purchased some salmon & Tinned Sausages & Biscuits & had quite a Banquet at Tea Time. After Tea it commenced to Rain & our Tent leaked in many places which caused a little bit of excitement Commenced a Letter to M.S.\n","185":" Rain cleared off this morning. Kept Busy putting down duckboards. Glory! Brian Aspinall informed us that 5 are going on leave this week. Bluey Riley getting wounded makes me fifth on the List. The rest of the Bearers are going out to the Line tomorrow, so we are wondering if the Col. will let us go. Snowy Atherton is coming with me which is one jolly good job.\n","186":" The Bearers went out to the Line again today. We went over to Ordnance & were issued with new uniforms & Hats. After Dinner we buried one poor devil of the 3rd London who was gassed. Lord, it’s a horrible death. Before going to Bunk we had a hot Bath & put on a clean change of underclothing.\n","187":" After Break. we put all our things ready for the move off. Brian Aspinall gave us our warrants & about 12 we buzzed off to Bapaume station in a motor Amb. It was a glorious day & we were all in high spirits. Arrived Bapaume station about 12.30 went to R.T.O’s office to get our warrants examined. While waiting for the Train I met Wally Hind, who was also going on Leave to Blighty. He has 2 pips up now, & is o\/c Trench Mortar Batteries. We left Bapaume about 3.30 in cattle trucks. It was a great trip, everybody was in such high spirits. We changed Trains at Candas, where the French take over the railway from the British. Arrived Boulogne about 11.30 Sunday morning. From the Train we marched to Coppin’s Rest Camp. Here we had some refreshments, bought from the Canteen & a wash & Brush up. \n\nAt 3.15 we marched down to the Boat. She sailed at 4.30. The Channel was quite calm, & we were well guarded by a number of destroyers. On the way over we had some meat pies & Tea down at the Canteen. Arrived in Folkestone a bit after 6. It was just glorious being in England again after having been away so many years. People evidently knew ours was the Leave Train, as all along the route to London they waved their hand Kefs. Arrived in London about 9. Here the \"Dinkum Anzacs\" from Horseferry Road met us, but Snowy & the rest of our party preferred to go on our own. On arrival at H.Q. they paid us straightaway & stamped our warrants. Then we went to the Shaftesbury Hotel & booked a Room.\n","188":" Snowy & I shared a double Room. After a wash & Brush up, we went for a stroll around the City. It was glorious to know that we were free, & we wandered around till about midnight. Then it commenced to thunder & lighten & the Rain poured down. This made us think about Bed, but we found that it was too late to get a Bus or Taxi, & just had to dodge back from from doorway to another. It was in the early hours of the morning that we arrived back at our Hotel. We soon turned in between the sheets & were asleep in no time.\n","189":" Woke up by a bang on the door & a voice informing us that it was \"9 oclock\" We hopped out of Bed & opened the Door. The Girl asked us if we’d like Break in Bed. Of course we jumped at it. Went back to Bed & had Bacon & Eggs & Coffee. Then we had a Bath. Got dressed & went out. London is some Town alright. After wandering around for a couple of hours we went into a Place & had Lunch. After Lunch I went to a Tailor & got him to alter my tunic. A girl from Paddington was working in the shop, & she had a great yarn with \"Snowy\" Atherton Returned to Shaftsbury & had wash & \"brush up\"\n\nAfter Tea sat gazing out of window for a time. Then we went to Palace Theatre & saw Vanity Fair. A jolly fine Show. Nelson Keys, funny as a Circus.\n","190":" Had Break in Bed again. Got up about 9. Went to Whitehall & saw them changing Guard. Life Guards & the Blues. Great sight. Then went on to Buckingham & saw them changing Guard there. It was wonderful. The men marched like machines. We also saw the men coming out after being decorated by the King. There was a big crowd & as each man came away he was greeted with much applause. We then met Bunny & Charley Whitaker. Visited Westminster Abbey. Saw the Tombs of Wellington, Nelson & many other famous persons, also saw the Gun carriage on which the Iron Duke’s body was conveyed. It is made of captured French Guns. Went into a restaurant & had a great feed of Steak & chipped potatoes. At night we went to see Chu Chin Chow. It was a great Show. Oscar Asche & Lilly Brayton are as good as ever.\n","191":" Spent a quiet day wandering around the City, Riding in Taxis & Buses. The Girl Conductors look very sweet in their neat blue uniforms & hats turned up at the side. Visited Madame Tussaud’s. It was most interesting. The wax figures look almost life-like. Snowy & I wandered into what we thought was a nice restaurant – but it turned out to be vegetarian. We tried some nut pie & raspberry pudding – then we gave it up & went to another place for a feed. In the afternoon we purchased Post Cards & writing material & went back to the Shaftesbury. Had an hours sleep, then we spent an hour in the Writing Room. Sent a few Post Cards & wrote to Lill. What a wonderful difference it would make if only she were here. Gee! What a time we’d have.\n","192":" 5 years today Lill left England Father’s Birthday & Empire Day. Snowy & I went to Southend. It was a Perfect Day. We arrived Southend about midday. Aunt Pudney was surprised to see me. We had a good Dinner there. Mr Pudney made us feel quite at Home. Olive is a very nice Girl. Mrs Pudney & I adjourned to the sitting room, where we had a great old yarn about Lill. She showed me her photo Album, in which I saw Lill Absolom as a Kid. What a bonnie Kid she was too. Florrie is married to a sergeant in the Flying Corps. She is almost as good looking as her cousin. Snowy & I went for a stroll around the Town. It was very quiet. Mrs P wanted us to stay overnight, but we couldn’t spare the time. Went to a photographers to get my picture taken, but he was out.\n","193":" Went to Southampton. Got there about 2 oclock. Aunt Nell was not a bit surprised to see me, as she said she had expected me so long. It is a very nice part of the suburb in which she lives & a very pretty cottage & Garden. I showed my collection of pictures She (like everyone else) quiet fell in Love with Lill; & asked me how I managed to win such a nice little Wife – but that is a mystery. I don’t know myself. She must miss Uncle Stewart very much. I had a scrumptious Tea. Ate about 2 lbs of Lovely Home made Cake. Aunt Nell gave me what was left to bring away. Snowy Atherton soon made a mess of it – ably assisted by C.W. & Bunny. She was quite put out because I couldn’t stay overnight, but Lord, what can a man do in 10 days?\n","194":" Got up about 8 & went out quite early. Had a shave. Then I put my things together & prepared to go to Stone. Bunny & Snowy came down to Euston with me & saw me on to the Train. Arrived Stafford 4 p.m. Caught Train to Stone at 4.50. Arrived Stone about 5.30. Saw Jem. Starkey & Topper Wooley on Station. Didn’t seem altered a bit. Went to Crown & Anchor. It was great to be under the old Thatch one more. Looked into Unicorn Hotel. Saw Ernest Jackson & had a great old yarn. He’s got awfully fat. Just as left his shop met Mr Blakeman. He would have me return then & there with him, so I went back to Shirleywich with him. Frank met us with the Float. He has grown into a big chap. Ruth & Mrs B. very pleased to see me.\n\nMrs B looks quite an old Lady. The Shock of John’s death must have affected her very much. Mr B. looks quite well. Much better than I expected. Ruth has grown into quite a woman. Jolly fine woman, too. John’s wife looks very well. His son Alec is a bright bonnie kid. His Grandma & Grandma think the world of him. They made quite fuss of me. Put me in such a lovely big room to sleep. There were all kinds of Girls nick nacks hanging around & it made me feel quite Homesick. Felt lost without pyjamas. Slept soundly & peacefully. Made me think quite a lot of M.S. Bless Her. Actually said my Prayers. First time for years.\n\nMonday\n","195":" Glorious morning. In the Garden, a thrush was singing away merrily & across the meadows came the call of the cuckoo. I looked out of the window. In the distance, the village Church bells were ringing & all seemed good with the world. What a difference to Bullencourt After shaving & ablutions I went down to Breakfast Bacon & Eggs, & nice Fresh Butter Gee! How I enjoyed it. After Break. went round the Farm with Mr Blakeman, Frank & young Alec. My word he’s a bonnie kid. \n\nThe crops are looking excellent. There is plenty of Food for the cows & they look fat & content. How I enjoyed my Dinner. Roast Beef, Potatoes, Cabbage, followed by Beastings Pudding. I almost felt ashamed of my appetite. After Dinner we adjourned to the Drawing Room where Ruth played, & Jack’s wife sang. Three kiddies came to Dinner. The elder girl was very pretty but she played the piano viley. I quite enjoyed that afternoon. After Tea I went to Church with Mrs Blakeman & Ruth. We arrived late. It was a very nice service, & the parson preached a good serMon. In his spare time he works on the Land. We had supper on our return. Then Mr B. & I sat yarning for about an Hour. I went to Bed feeling at Peace with the world.\n","196":" After Breakfast I borrowed Frank’s Bike & went to see Lizzie Rowley, who lives about a mile away from Ruth’s. It was great to ride along the peaceful country roads, with the birds singing merrily & the sun shining; & very pleasant to talk to people in good old English after being in France & Egypt for so many months.\n\nMon. May 28 (cont) Lizzie was washing when I arrived. What a great old yarn we had about old times. I stayed & had Dinner, Rabbit Pie, which was very nice indeed. Got punctured & a chap next door, very kindly repaired it for me. After Dinner I went on to Stone. Lizzie gave me a big bunch of Lilacs to put on Father’s Grave. The Cemetery was looking very nice, plenty of flowers & the green grass & neat. Father’s grave I found quite easily. It looks well & evidently receives regular attention. Went on to Stone. Called in & had a yarn with Annie Shardlow. She told me some great yarns about Father. Went to Unicorn Hotel. Had tea there. Then I went down to Ern Harveys, but he was out. Called in \"Black Horse\". Saw Mr & Mrs Bloom. Mr B is getting quite an old man. Met Ernest Jackson & Polly Warren. Stopped & had a great old yarn. Slept at Polly Warren’s.\n","197":" Got up about 9. Alice James got my Breakfast. Went over to Adie’s after Break. & bought some Post Cards & sent one to Lill. Met Mr Pyatt, Tommy Adie, Mr Gilbert, Redman. Had great old yarn. All asked about Mother, France. Cis & asked to be kindly remembered to them. Must tell ‘em when I write. Saw Mr & Mrs Lawley, Mr & Mrs Shaw. Met Pat Astbury in street & promised to go to tea – but missed. Met Jack Turner, \"Tugger\" Key & a whole crowd of people. Jack took me down to \"the Swan\" where I met another crowd I knew. Mrs Gorman, Snape & all the \"elite\" of Abbey Court . They flung their arms round my neck & kissed me before I could get away. Met Ern Harvey after Tea. We had a very enjoyable time together. Had a sing song at \"The Alma\". I went home with him afterwards & slept there.\n","198":" Went the Milk round with Anvil. Saw quite a lot of folks who knew me. Went to Pat Astbury’s. Had a great old yarn with her. She made me stay & have some Dinner. Then she sewed some buttons on my pants. Paid a visit to Mrs Morris. She made a great fuss of me & gave me a Box of Cigarettes before leaving. Met Freddy down the Town. He is just the same as ever. Met Freakley & Mr Swift. They don’t seem to be altered much.\n","199":" \n","200":" We turned out at 4 a.m. & after a hard struggle managed to get a drink of Tea. Then we grabbed our Gear & pushed our way to the R.T.O’s office, where we were given Tickets stamped \"Detained at Etaples from May 31 till June 3.\" which were very useful to men who had overstayed their Leave. We then went down to the Station & got aboard the Train. It did not leave till 9.30. After an uneventful & most dreary trip we arrived in Albert about 4. One chap fell out of the Train & got his Foot crushed. I almost envied him. We got a motor Lorry from Albert to Bapaume. On our way back we met Sammy who informed me that I had been away the M.M. to which I said \"Hooray\"\n","201":" Reveille at 6. First Parade at 7. We were excused the early morning Parade, & also the others. Break at 7.15. The rest of the crowd went for a Route March with full marching order. Snowy & I stayed behind to fix up our things. This is a very pretty Camp we are in. Just the ruins of a number of Houses. Some are in fair condition. Our chaps spend quite a lot of time in the Garden, & it is beginning to look very nice. Outside the Tents they have made mottoes with bits of broken pitcher. Some are very good indeed. Billsy May returned from Hospital. The wound in his back is not healed yet, but the silly beggar reckons he can’t stay away from the mob.\n","202":" Finished Letter to M.S. Also wrote Stone, to Old Road. Glorious weather. Quite hot. Went for Route March with Capt. Irving. Tried to get to Picture Show at night with Snowy, Billsy & Towny but after waiting around for about an hour they came out & announced that the Show was off. We went into what is left of Bapaume Church. The Huns blew it up. In one big vault there are a big number of skulls, which are said to be some of the Heads that were chopped off during the Revolution.\n","203":" Weather continues good. Gas Helmet & stretcher drill. This afternoon our cricket team played the 3rd C.C.S & beat them by 3 wickets. We drove down to the Ground in Motors. After Dinner I wrote to Ruth B & Mother.\n","204":" Squad Drill with Capt Irving.

Es Smith drove us into Albert Station where we caught the Train. There was a big crowd & it was some time before we could get our Tickets. The fare was ½ F. The Train left Albert at 8.30 & arrived in Amiens about 9.45. There was a big crowd of our chaps in the City & the shops did a thriving Business. The first place I visited was a photographers. I got my picture taken & they promised to send them on in 3 weeks time. 20 Fs for a dozen. Snowy Atherton, Nigger Bowden, Bluey Stanton & Bricky Mason were with me. We visited the Cathedral & spent some time viewing the wonderful carvings. Most of the best work is covered by sandbags. The weeping Angel is a very fine piece of work. It is a copy of the original in Rheims Cathedral, which was destroyed.\n\nSun June 10 (cont.) We had Dinner at a very nice place, where a girl works who Billsy May is always talking about. Her name is Marie Louise. We found out that while Billsy & Sid Royall were there they helped M. L. to wash up, so we give ‘em a about it when we return. After Dinner we strolled around the City & made a few purchases. I bought a little souvenir for Lill of the Weeping Angel. After wandering around for a while we went for a ride in the Tram. \n\nIn London the drivers are men & the conductors girls, but in France the positions are reversed. After the Tram ride we sat down in the Park for about an hour. Then we had Tea. Steak & Eggs & Bread & Butter, & cakes. For this we had to pay 4 Fs each. We went around the shops & bought some P Cards, then we got back to the Station. The Train left about 8 & we got to Albert about 9.30. We walked along the Bapaume Road & waited for a Motor lorry. One came along about 11.30 & we were soon back in our Tent & asleep, as it had been a very trying day.\n","208":" Signalling Squad Drill.

Commenced writing my weekly epistle. Got as far as page 6 before \"Lights out\".\n\nAfter Tea we went down to the village to see the finals of the Brigade Boxing Tourney. There were 4 3 - 2 min round Bouts & most of ‘em were either clever or funny. One little officer caused a lot of amusement. He was a good age, too, but only lasted 2 rounds. There was a middle weight match for 50 Francs which was quite exciting. The 8 Brigade Band played at intervals & Gen. Tivey was there. It passed the night away very nicely.\n","224":" Busy day getting ready for the Competition. We had a go at Waggon loading today & did very well. Maj.

Our Cooks brought out a Copper & made us some Tea, so we had Dinner on the Grounds, & made quite a picnic of it.\n\nThur. July 5th They gave us the day off, after about an Hour’s Gas drill.

The Infantry gave their display first & put up a very fine show. Then came the physical culture crowd. Part of ‘em wearing white shorts & the rest blue. They formed up on the Ground in the shape of a St George’s Cross. The Artillery gave a very fine display. As they were galloping off the grounds, the W.O. got thrown from his Horse.

Left Senlis about mid-day as a stretcher case. Arrived C.C.S. about 4 p.m. \n\nT. 100.6 Ordered to Bed & to be evacuated.\n","257":" First time I’ve been a real patient in a Hospital. Am in a big marquee with about 30 others. Slept fairly well last night, although the Blankets are a bit lively. Tucker not too good, just plain Bread & Butter & Tea. Medicine 3 times a day.\n\nWe are wondering whether or not the Train will turn up to take us away. Gee! The crowd in this ward are not very sick. They fool around all day, but as soon as the M.O. appears, they hop back to Bed & grunt & cough. About 6 the train came in, & there was joy in the camp. I came as a lying case, but am going away as a sitting case. I’m afraid my chances of Blighty are getting dim, but I must keep up heart. \"Faint heart etc\"\n\nArrival in hospital \n\nSun. July 29 (cont) We boarded the train at about 6.30 pm. The orderly gave us a cup of cocoa & some Bread & Butter. Then he handed round the cigarettes. It is quite comfortable on the Hosp. Train. The Nurses came round & the M.O. asked us if we were comfortable. We left C.C.S. about 10. Arrived Rouen about 4 a.m. \n\n \nTues\n","258":" \n\nWere met by motor char-a-bancs & taken to No 5 Gen. Hospital. \n\nHere we were given a clean change of clothes & the Hospital suit of Blue, with white shirt & red kerchief Tie. Had Break. Porridge, Bread & Butter.\n\nThen we had a good bath & put on our clean clothes. There are plenty of Nurses about & they all seem very nice. They brought us round Cigarettes, 5 per man – per day. After Dinner the Doctor came round & gave us all a thorough examination. My Temp. is quite normal – worse luck. The nurses are very nice & will have a yarn, if they are not too busy. That’s twice today I’ve said the nurses are nice, but really news are so scarce that one must repeat ones sayings occasionally but its quite true that the nurses are nice. \n","259":" Feeling pretty good this morning. The M.O. marked 3 chaps for Blighty this morning. Lucky beggars. My Temp. is 97, so I reckon he’ll be soon passing me out to the Com. Camp. Had a good dinner. Roast mutton, Beans & Potatoes. Sago. We find things very slow. If I had some writing Paper, I could write to Lill.\n\nI am 9th man to tell my tale of woe to the doc. & its rather a strain to make up a feasible yarn that will appeal to him after 8 others have had a go.\n","260":" Raining heavily. The M.O. marked a D on my Diet Sheet this morning. I find that it means I’m not permanently unfit, but there is still a faint hope of getting to Blighty. The orderly greatly cheered us up by saying that nearly everybody who left this Marquee 13 went over to E. Good news in the Paper. 3500 prisoners taken. Every time our fellows have a big \"hop-over\" it rains like the very devil. Evidently the terrific bombardment has something to do with it. \n","261":" A lot of gassed cases came in during the night. We had sop for Breakfast again. Raining Cats & dogs. Sister almost had a fit this morning, The Thermometer registered 109 ° when she took my Temp.\n\nA big convoy of sick & wounded came in – also a good number of gassed cases. 3 Gassed cases came into our ward. They say that Fritz is putting over some new kind of Gas, which they can neither see or smell. It affects their eyes & sends them to sleep. \n\nThis is a poor sort of place. I can’t even raise a few sheets of paper to write to M.S. Have plenty of time too; & if I had Paper could write a good long Letter.\n","262":" The M.O. marked 5 of us to C.C. so it’s Goodbye to my chances of Blighty. Got my few items of uniform from the Store. They have been through a Fumigator & are in an awful state, the pants were quite useless. At 2 o’clock we paraded to the Clothes Store & got a new rig-out. Got a pair of Infantry pants about 2 sizes too small They are most uncomfortable & unsightly. At 4.30 we fell in again, handed in our Hospital suits, & were marched off to the Con. Camp. Here the M.O. examined our Pay Books to see when we were last inoculated. Then we were told off to Tents. There are all sorts in this Camp. Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians, S. Africans, Jamaicans & full blooded niggers.\n","263":"\n\n3rd Anniversary of the War.\n\nIt has rained now for 4 consecutive days. Last night it came down very heavily, & its just as bad now. The poor devils in the Line must be suffering. At Breakfast I met Bill Lancaster. Like me he was not lucky enough to get to Blighty. He looks real sick. The Breakfast was very rough. Weak, cold Tea. A small piece of Fat Ham, & dripping in place of Butter. Last night went to Y.M.C.A. It is a fine building with Billiards & all kinds of games & 2 pianos. It was absolutely packed. I had a cup of Tea & some Biscuits, also procured a few sheets of paper, so now I can do what I’ve wanted to all the week & that is write Letter No. 28 to old B.E.\n\nDinner was fairly decent. Roast mutton & Peas – Plum duff. After dinner went over to Church Army Hut. It is a very fine building, would seat about 1000. It has a fine stage, & I believe they have a very good Concert Party – permanent. \n\nFor Tea, Bread & Butter, & weak greasy looking tea & some raisins. After Tea went to Y.M.C.A. Hut, where a very good Concert was given by a party of Ladies. It is still raining heavily & shows no sign of easing.\n\nCon. Camp\n","264":" Good Lord: reveille at 6 – Sunday morning too. It’s enough to drive a man to drink – Church Parade in Church Army Hut. Nice cheerful service. The music was supplied by a string orchestra of about 12 performers. The chaplain didn’t preach a sermon, but had a straight little talk with the Boys. The Hall was packed & as I looked around, it struck me what a cosmopolitan crowd we were. On either side of me was a Maori & a Canadian. Right in front sat a chap as black as the ace of spades, & next to him sat a S. African. The parade was in charge of a W.O. of the Westminster Dragoons. It is pouring in rain again. \n\nI put in for a pass to Rouen but it won’t be much use unless the rain knocks off. Fell in at Police Tent & were issued with Belts & passes. Walked about ¾ mile along the road to the Tram. Electric Trams, but they travel very slowly. Arrived Rouen after about ½ hours ride. Fine, big city. Full of Troops, all nationalities. Shops & cafes all in full swing. Anybody can get a feed & a drink at any hour, excepting British troops. These have to wait till 6 before they can obtain a refresher. A machine gunner, Jack Benton, 14 B’ge, came in with me. We visited the cathedral first. It is a beautiful building & very very old. A service was being held, & we were lucky in hearing the fine organ, & the choir in some beautiful singing. Next we visited the Market Square where Joan of Arc was burnt by English soldiers.\n\nSun. Aug. 5 cont.\n\nA fine statue is erected in her memory. We went on to a Tower (forget the name) which is 450 feet high. An excellent view of the city & surrounding country can be obtained from the top, but not feeling too fit, we refrained from the climb. Took a stroll through the City. Feeling hungry, adjourned to Café. 3 Girls behind counter. Was considering what French words to bring into play, when one of the Girls said, in excellent English \"What do you want please?\" Discovered it was run by some English Ladies. We got cup of Tea, 2 Eggs & 2 pieces of Bread & Butter for 9 ½ d which was very reasonable. No sugar in the Tea. We left Con. Camp with 5 francs which I borrowed from Bill Lancaster. We were sitting back enjoying a smoke of Issued Tobacco, when a S. Major strolled in. Sat down beside us & had a yarn. Then he invited us to join him in some Tea. We did. Had some muffins & cakes & Tea. After this we had another stroll round the city & returned to Con. Camp.\n","265":" More bloomin’ rain. Doctor ordered me to Bed again as Temp. was 100 ° . Got sick of Bed, went down to Y.M.C.A. Saw & heard a good concert, given my a number of ladies. It was very good. Managed to scribble a few lines to Lill, but, twas a very poor attempt.\n","266":" No Breakfast. \"Doc\" put me on milk diet. Rice for dinner Bread & Butter. Tea Temp. 99.8 Feeling pretty rotten.\n","267":" Things looking brighter. Got up to Breakfast. Went to sit down on one of the seats, when who should I see sitting there but \"Oriss\" He was quite a treat for sore eyes. Thought surely he was in Blighty, but, like me, he was unlucky. We drew ten francs Attended a Concert in the Y.M.C.A. Very good indeed.\n","268":" Mixture of Sunshine & Showers. Feeling pretty groggy in the Legs & Back. Doctor ordered me a tonic. Managed to struggle up to Mess Hut for meals. \"Oriss\" & I spent greater part of the day in Y.M.C.A. Hut. It rained after Tea, so we sat on my Bed & swapped yarns & showed each other our photos & snapshots. B.E. will have to forgive me for not writing these days.\n","269":" Beautiful, sunshiny day. Doctor marked me for Bushy at morning sick parade. It is a big Rest Camp away out in the Country. I’ll see what happens to Blanton. He has to be Xrayed. Be alright if he comes too. Don’t like the idea of going on my own.\n\nFri. Aug. 10. (cont) Attended lecture at Y.M. on Madagascar, by a chap who had lived there for 20 years. A good series of Lantern slides. Very interesting. He told us that the island was 1000 miles long. Rubber & Rice in plenty, but no coal, serious drawback. We played Ping-pong – 3 most exciting games. Oriss\" proving the victor by 2 to 1. After this we went to Concert in Church Army Hut. Very good indeed. Now I’m going to Bed. Good night B.E.\n","270":" Went into Rouen with \"Oriss\". It rained for a while but cleared up soon after we started. Hit city about 3. Saw party of German prisoners working on wharf. Visited Cathedral. Very interesting ceremony on. Priests in fancy dress & acolytes swinging incense. Choir Boys in Scarlet & Lace looked very impressive.\n\n Vist to Rouen \n\nSat. Aug 11(cont)\n\nOriss went to Pay Office, but was turned down. Had afternoon Tea at Wesleyan Soldier’s Home. Spent a pleasant hour there reading. Comfortable & quiet rooms. Strolled round City, then adjourned for Feed of Eggs & Muffins. After Tea had quite an adventure in a Curiosity shop. Some very fine & interesting things on view. Oriss seemed to have an enjoyable time. Returned to camp about 8.30.\n","271":" \"Oriss\" got marked for Base, so I will go with him if the M.O. will stand it. Fine day. Party in our Hut told off for Harvesting. Went to evening service in Church Army Hut. A Lifeguardsman presented the Chapel with a fine Lectern which the padre dedicated. Very nice service. Hall packed. Officers, Nurses, & soldiers of all kinds.\n","272":" M.O. marked me for Base. Spent afternoon in Y.M. Played few games Ping-Pong. Raining again. Fell in at 5 & marched over to Collecting Camp. 16 of us in a Bell Tent. Only one blanket – no boards on ground. Had very little sleep.\n","273":" Reveille at 6. Woke up feeling pretty rotten. Discovered had a lovely cold, owing to sleeping on damp ground. Breakfast 6.30 Small piece cold Bacon & 1 slice Bread per man. This is the Life. Went over to Con. Camp. Spent day there & had dinner & tea there also. Once went over to Base Camp. Attended Concert in Y.M. Hut. Pretty good. Pouring rain again good thing for cold, sleeping on wet ground.\n\nARRIVED BASE\n","274":" Fell in at 7 a.m. for Base. Issued with Iron Rations for Train journey. Marched to Rouen Station. About 3 miles. Actually carriages for troops to ride in. Surely we are \"winning the War\" Train pulled up at Station. Obtained Hot water from Engine driver & made Tea. Had a Feed. Very Pretty country – passing. Plenty of Fruit about. Arrived Harfleur about 1.30 detrained. Marched to Y.M. Hut, where they gave us some Tea & Bread & Jam Then went to No 24 Camp. Fine camp. Well laid out. Had good feed at Tea Time. First one for weeks. Corned Rabbit Plum duff. Met Bill Lancaster. Visited Salvation Army & Y.M. Hut. Fine big buildings. Really ought write some Letters, but feel so rotten. Sorry Lill. Will go to Bed & try & sleep this rotten cold away. Good night L x \n\nBASE\n","275":" Glory – Alleluia! Steak for Break - Quite a shock. Visited Q.M. Store & got issued with Outfit to resume the offensive Got everything but pants, just the thing I most needed. After Tea attended Concert in Y.M. Hut, given by \"Lena Ashwell’s Party\". It was very fine, but too high class for many. This morning the M.O. inspected us. I told him was suffering from cold in the Head, but he seemed to think it was a big Joke & \"passed me out\".\n","276":" \"Oriss\" & I spent a quiet morning. Break was very light. Bean Soup & Tea. Messin’ about all day on Parades. Attended Concert at Y.M. Hut given by the \"Lyre Birds\" (2nd Div. Band) It was their first Concert & was an excellent attempt. Got pants from Q.M. so now we are fixed up.\n\nPaid at Base\n","277":" Fine day, sun shining & things looking bright. Was told off to take charge of a working party, but after fooling around for a time, we dispersed. Fell in at 11 & got a Paid (30 Fs) Now all we want is leave to Havre. Went to Concert at Y.M. but it was very rough. This Camp is well laid out. Fine big, airy mess–rooms, plenty of Recreation Rooms & Showers. The food is also very good, quite a treat after our starvation diet of the past fortnight at the Hospital & Con. Camp.\n","278":" Much to our surprise, Oriss & I discovered our name on the Leave list. We attended Church Service at the C of E Hut. Bishop somebody took the service. He confirmed a number of chaps. After a good dinner of Roast meat, Vegs, & Plum duff, we took the Train from Rouelles into Havre. Fare 1d. The Train was packed with troops on leave.\n\nVisit to Havre\n\nSun. Aug. 19 (cont) We arrived in Havre about 2.20. It is a beautiful city, quite the best place we’ve struck in France. Saw a no. of dirigibles cruising along the coast, also quite a lot of sea-planes. It was a grand day. The town reminded me very much of St Kilda. We walked down to the Beach & spent a very enjoyable half hour in the water. There was quite a big crowd in the water including quite a number of mdd’elles. It was quite like old times. There is a good dressing shed run by the military, where one can obtain swimming togs. & towel for 2d. It just wanted old B.E. there to make it a perfect day. We sat on the Beach for a while & enjoyed a sun Bake. The only drawback to the Beach is that its big pebbles instead of sand, & is rather hard on one’s feet.\n\nAbout 4 we adjourned to a very nice café & had afternoon Tea. Then we took a stroll through the city. There are some very fine Public Buildings & the City is well laid out. Electric Trams. Had a good Tea. Eggs, Salad, Bread & Butter. After that we strolled through some of the most interesting parts of the Town. Visited a big café, & watched them playing French Billiards for a time. French Billiard Tables have no pockets, & it is a novelty to watch a game in progress.\n\nWe struck up a yarn with a Belgian officer & his wife, & then he asked us to join him in a drink – which we did. I asked one of the waitresses if they had any Lager, but she couldn’t compre my French. I was just giving it up as a bad Job when a girl came to my rescue, & acted as interpreter. We got the Lager & everybody was all smiles. Had a most exciting Tram ride back to Camp.\n\nTHRO’ THE BULL-RING\n","279":" Told off to attend Gas school. Fell in at 7.30 & marched off with a big crowd of Artillery & L.H. A band played us part of the way. It was quite like old times again at Liverpool. Arrived Bull Ring about 9. It is a finely laid out Camp, Artillery, A.S.C. & all branches of the service have the finishing touches applied here before going down the Line. There is also a big Vet. Hosp. there, where sick & injured horses receive treatment. Each horse has it’s diet & treatment sheet over it’s stall, just as patients in Hospital have their’s over their bunks. We were given Lectures during the morning on the affects of the different gasses, & also received instruction on the way to combat against it’s affects. We then put on our S.B.Rs & passed through a Gas Chamber. At 12.30 we had Lunch. We brought rations for 10 men, but as there were only 6 of us we had plenty to go round.\n\nWrote a Letter to M.S. No. 30. \n\nAt the Base\n\nAfter dinner we had another Lecture on \"Gas & the care of Gas Helmets\". Then we went thro’ another Gas chamber, & as we came out our tickets were stamped. We then returned to Camp, arriving there about 5.30. Here we met Sgt. Petit, Jack Woodward & S\/Sgt Brenda. It appears that all supernumerary W.C.O’s have to return to the Base. There is a big crowd of ‘em here already & they are still coming in.\n","280":" Glorious weather. Break. very light. Was told off to see the Lines were cleared up for C.O’s inspection. After dinner I wrote a few Letters. Don’t care how soon I am sent back to my unit now, as its very monotonous in this Camp.\n\nAt the Base\n","281":" Weather still good. Did some washing. Getting very monotonous in this Camp. Shall be glad to get back to the old crowd. \"Oriss\" is working on a Fatigue Party wheeling Barrow loads of dirt about, but I am doing nothing. Staff. Brender & Jack Woodward went away last night with an Artillery draft. After Tea wrote Mrs Pudney & Ruth B.\n","282":" Rained heavily last night & the ground is quite sloppy again. \"Oriss\" had a nasty fit of coughing during the night & spit up a lot of Blood. He paraded to the M.O. (so called) but, of course, got no satisfaction. \n\nLater Oriss got much worse, & was spiting up clots of Blood. This was no good, so I went to the Orderly Room & asked to be paraded to the O.C. Of course they wanted to know my reason, & when I told ‘em, they lived up a bit &\n\nLEFT BASE\n\n \"Oriss\" was sent away in an ambulance to the Hospital at Havre. It was a Casino & is a fine building, situated on the Esplanade.\n\nAfter Tea I took a few Cards at House. It rained very heavily & threatened to break up the school, but we stuck it, & I came away winning 10 Francs.\n","283":" Passed the M.O. this morning & marked for duty. We leave with a draft tonight to resume the strafe. Spent the morning fixing up my gear. Wrote a few lines to \"Oriss\". Had Tea at 3.30. Fell in at 4.15 & marched away with a big crowd of Arty Inf. Tunnellers, Engrs, etc. to Havre Station, where we entrained. \n\nI was i\/c of 5 Div. A.M.C. which consisted of Phil Murray & myself. Lt. Slaughter was i\/c of the whole party. There were 3 of us in our carriage. We were lucky in getting a carriage as most of the crowd travelled in Trucks.\n\nFri. Aug. 24 (cont) On arriving at Station we were issued with 48 hours rations. By the time we got all our gear & rations aboard, the carriage was full. We left Havre about 9.30 & after a very bumpy ride, we arrived at Rouen about 5 am on Sat. Aug 25th \n\nLast night we got very little sleep, as the carriage was so crowded. We sat up at intervals & had a little refreshment or a smoke. We detrained at Rouen & marched about 2 miles to a Rest Camp, where we purchased Coffee, Eggs, Bread & Butter & Cake & managed to make quite a decent feed. We also had a wash & brush up, which refreshed us greatly. \n\nIt is 9 oclock now & we are sitting alongside the river Seine watching the traffic move up & down & wondering what’s going to happen next. It’s a glorious morning. \n\nSat \nFri\n Aug 2 \n4\n5 (cont)\n\nSpent the morning quietly. Quite a crowd of vendors are buzzing around selling P. Cards mirrors, etc. I purchased a small pocket mirror which will be very handy as it takes up so little room in ones pocket. I had a franc & half left which was practically useless, so I invested it in a few games at \"Housey\" & actually won 5 Fs, with which Murray & I purchased Tomatoes & Cake for Dinner. \n\nWe fell in about 3 & marched away to the Station. Before I left I got quite friendly with a little French girl, whom I made a friend for Life by giving her a small case containing mirror & comb. Her smile of thanks was worth a months pay. We got aboard the train, trucks this time, carriages were for \"Officers only\". Murray & I got in with the Q.M. & Stores, so we did alright for Tucker. There were 20 of us in the carriage & we just had enough room for each man to lie down. We passed through some very pretty country.\n","284":" The farmers were all busy gathering their crops. In some places troops were assisting & seemed to be enjoying the fun. The train pulled up a couple of times near some orchards, which, needless to say, suffered at the hands of the crowd. The owners of the Fruit must have heaved a sigh of relief when the train moved off again. We managed to get a few hours sleep during the night, despite the bumping of the train & the very close proximity of ones bedfellows. It was about 4 p.m. when we left Rouen & we arrived at Etaples about 4.30 a.m. on Sun. 26 \n\nHere we obtained Tea from Y.M. & various canteens & had Breakfast & a wash. Quite a number of troop trains were pulled up here & we met Cosier, Bob Roberts & Gibson, who were on their way to the Officers training school at Aveloy. . Staff Hughes was also among them, but we did not see him. We left Etaples about 7.15 a.m. arriving at Calais at 10.30. Our next stop was St. Omer where a big number of troops detrained. We left here about 1 p.m. arriving at Ebblingham about 2.\n\nHere we detrained & Murray & I wended our way in easy stages to a village called Racquingham. We met Geo. Watson on Ebbm station, who was on his way to Blighty, & he directed us to the Farm which are our H.Q. It was good to be among the old faces again. The sections are billeted at farms about ½ a mile away from each other. B sec. are at a Farm, in a big barn. After Tea we sat around & had a good old yarn, then I went to Bed, sleeping between Snowy Atherton & Archie Deed. I was jolly tired & soon went to sleep.\n","285":" Slept in this morning & did not appear on Parade. Weather very rough, raining heavily & cold wind blowing. There is a little girl at the Farm named Marie. She dodges in & out of our billet & is a great favourite among the boys. Yesterday I got quite a big bunch of mail. 4 Letters from Lill, 1 from Mother, 2 from France & one from Nell. Everybody well, thank Goodness, but surprised to hear that France is going to one of the Fronts.\n\nWrote Letter No 31 to M.S.\n","286":" Orderly Corpl. Wet, miserable day. Had my meals in the Cookhouse. Tomorrow \"Doug\" Haig inspects the Division & the crowd are busy polishing their gear. Fierce, cold wind blowing. Quite a lot of trees blown down, & stacks upset.\n","287":" Still raining & the wind stronger than ever. Some of our chaps had to go out & clear away trees that had fallen across the road. My word the crowd did look well as the marched away for the Inspection. As my gear was not cleaned up I was excused, so stayed in the Billet & wrote Letters. Read a good yarn \"The Amateur Gentleman\". After Tea went for a stroll through La Belle Croix & several; other villages with Payney & F. Woods.\n","288":" Gas Helmet drill & Route March. We have no duties after Dinner. Sent \"Anzac Bully\" & P. Cd’s Havre & Rouen to Lill. We should have been paid today, but it didn’t come off. We are hoping it will happen tomorrow as everyone is broke. Jack Daunt & Bluey Stanton got their passes for Blighty. They leave tomorrow.\n","289":" Pay Day. drew 20 Fs. Paid 15 to Billy Williams, that left me with 5. I thought well this is not much use, so I played \"nap\" & tried to swell it - & lost it. Now I’m stone – motherless broke, & doing my best to kill time till next Pay day. Received Letter from Ruth B. Daunty & Bluey went on leave.\n","290":" Got Letter from \"Oriss\". He has had a very rough time, but is marked for Blighty. Lucky Beggar. Bill Lancaster got marked P.B. & is also in Blighty.\n","291":" Fine sunny day. Had Church Service in the Barn. Wrote Letter No 32 to M.S. After dinner went for walk to Roqueloire about 4 kilos away. The Portugese troops are billeted there. They wear a grey uniform, very similar to the Germans. The village is very pretty, each house has its garden, & the flowers & fruit are looking well. We arrived back in Camp about 9 pm. It was almost as light as day as we turned into our blankets, owing to a very bright moon & we quite expected to hear some Taubes over. True enough they did arrive. We could hear the whirr of their propellers, & the explosion of their Bombs shook our poor old Barn. Our A.A. Guns banged away at them & for a time there was quite a fierce bombardment. One of the A.A. nosecaps & several pieces of shell dropped quite near our billet. Of course Snowy & Billgy May & a few others had to go out & gape at the shells bursting.\n","292":" Some of our fellows went into St Omer on leave. When they returned we questioned them severely on the amount of damage that was done by Fritz’s Bombs. They said that it caught an Officer’s Mess & killed 2 airmen officers, but did very little damage considering the terrific row they made. Weather still good. After Tea Towny, Shag, Miles, Woodsy & I played a quiet game of nap for a few hours & I actually won 12 Fs. The Taubes came over & dropped a few more Bombs, but did not do much damage beyond breaking a few windows.\n","293":" \nGas drill\n Route march in marching order. We marched down to H.Q. & were then informed that we were to return to our billets & put on all our Gear. This kept the Parade waiting half an hour, but of course, they could not blame us for it. It was quite warm marching & we were always glad of a spell. One good thing about this country, there are plenty of trees to give shelter. We passed through several villages, the largest of them was Heuringhem which is 6 K. from St. Omer. The farmers are busy getting in their crops, mostly women & girls & old men. One must admire the French women for they way they carry on the work during the absence of their men-folk. They have very old fashioned appliances. Most of the crops around here were cut by hand, & the wheat & oats thrashed by a Horse Power machine.\n","294":" The weather is glorious this last few days. Nice blue sky & plenty of sunshine. We spent a quiet day, just cleaned up our billet & finished for the day. After Tea a combined A & C section Team played B sec. at Baseball. B sec. came second. Stan Wright & I walked into Roqueloire after Tea. This afternoon the Engineers were experimenting with some new explosive for cutting wire. If noise counts anything towards success, then it was certainly a great success, as it nearly deafened us. Things are awfully slow, one hardly knows how to put in time.\n","295":" Did some washing this morning. I job I detest. The weather is great. Quite a treat to be alive. Received Letter from Mrs. S Bacup. Heard today that Bill Lancaster was marked P.B. & sent over to Blighty. Lucky Beggar.\n","296":" This morning the Div. Gas Officer gave a very interesting Lecture on the new Gas that Fritz is sending over. We formed a square round the manure heap in the yard at H. Qtrs. After the Lecture he gave us a Tin to smell at containing some chemical, so that we would recognise Fritz’s Gas, if he sends any over our way. It is very similar to the aroma of mustard.\n\nReceived Letter & very welcome Parcel from Mrs Sam, containing Cakes & Cigarettes. Quite a treat, & we enjoyed Cake & Tongue for Tea. Wrote to Bacup. Our Rugby Team played 5 Mac. Gunners & won, 17 - 7 \n","297":" Herford, Hand, Sullings & a number of others returned from Leave. They stayed a number of days over time & this morning they paid the penalty. Herford & Hand lost their stripes & Sullings got 7 days 2nd F.P. Bad Luck to get caught. Gas drill. After Tea Jacko & I went for a stroll. We passed a very fine chateau, so on our way back to our Billet we walked through the grounds. It is a beautiful building & the grounds are very pretty. A stream runs through the grounds & is crossed by a number of quaint little bridges. Two bonnie little girls were playing on the Lawn & near them was a Fountain sending up the water in a fine spray. A lady & gent drove up to the front door while we were seated in the grounds. Evidently they were the owners. Sight of it made us both feel quite Homesick.\n\nWrote Letter to M.S. \n","298":" Fine sunny day. We marched down to Wardrecques to attend Church Parade. The Battns. were already there & the Band was in attendance. We were kept waiting for about ½ an hour for the Padre, but he failed to turn up, so the Band played \"God save the King\" & we returned to out Billets.\n","299":" Dave Fry was down at \nAire today at the Aerodrome, & the Flying Corps S.M. asked him if our Concert Party would go down there & give ‘em a show. We are without a Piano, & cannot give Concerts to our own crowd, so we decided to go down there as it would keep us in practice a bit. We shall miss \"Oriss\". In his last Letter he said that most likely he would be returning to Australia. Lucky Beggar.\n","300":" Today we got our N. B’s gear out & overhauled it. We put everything ready to go to the Flying Corps, but they failed to send a Conveyance & we had to abandon the proposed Concert.\n","301":" Football Match V 31st Batt. B. Coy. \"Old Kit\" made arrangements for us to give a Concert to the 55 Batt. at Lynd, & we have got everything ready for tomorrow night. We are getting our Photos taken, so even if this Concert doesn’t materialise, we won’t have wasted time in looking over our Gear. After Tea our Rugby Team wandered down to the Paddock where \"Doug Haig\" reviewed us & played the 31 Batt. B Coy. We were quite a large party of Barrackers & the Game was most interesting. We came Home winners 19 to nil.\n","302":"\n\nConcert at Lynde \n\nQuite an eventful day. Pay day. drew 30 F. Mail came in. Got Letters from Mother, France, Cis, Arthur, & 2 from M.S. Hooray!\n\nThe photor. came along & took our Photos. \"The Nightbirds\" & \"B sec. Botts\" Then we left in 2 Cars for Lynd. Jack Edgar & Ted Jane left earlier in the morning. When we arrived we had to search around the village for something to make a stage with, & also erect a Tent. Good Job we brought Jacky with us, as he worked like 3 men. Snowy Atherton made his maiden appearance, also Bert Overett, & both of ‘em did very well. The Piano arrived in the nick of time. Although it rained & a cold wind was blowing, our crowded audience stuck right to the end, & we class it, as one of our greatest successes.\n","303":" Payney & I spent a busy day flying around after the Photos. The Film that we used at Senlis turned out very well. 6 photos were taken in all & we got orders for nearly 400 pictures. The photographer promised to have them finished by Sunday morning, but I’m thinking he will have to get very busy. The proofs turned out splendidly. Commenced Letter 34 to B.E. \n","304":" There is a big Trench Mortar Stunt on over in the Paddock & there are scores of General’s & Staff Officer’s about. Finished Letter 34. \n\nMadame’s little Girl was sick this morning so I took the poor kid down to see Maj. Bond.\n","305":" Busy day packing up our Gear &am cleaning out the Barn. Obtained 300 photos from the chap in Wardracques. I went down about 10 a.m. & he was it the throes then of bustling to get ‘em finished. His wife also assisted & between us we managed to get them done. We left the Billet & marched down to H.Qrs about 5.30, then we returned to the Estaminet & had a Farewell sing song. We had an almost complete gathering of \"the Botts\" & every man was in good voice. During the business hour, W.O. Kitson, Sgts Mathieson & put in an appearance, so we made them honorary members of \"the Botts\" on them paying for a Round. Madame also contributed 6 Botts of Vin Blanc, & we had a very pleasant evening. Before returning we visit Madame with the sick piccaninny & enquired after her health. We left a souvenir group of the Botts with both Madames.\n","306":" Left Racquingham. Last night we slept in the Orderly Room. Stan Wright & a few more of us. We turned out at 6, & got ready for the Road. Left Racq. about 9 & marched about a mile along the Road till we joined up the Rest of our Brigade. It was quite a warm day & the Juice ran pretty freely. We tried a new idea on this march, forming ourselves into Gun Teams. Instead of carrying our Gear on our Backs, we loaded it on Spiders & hauled it along. \"Shag\" Miles, Woodsy, were among my Team & they were real good Haulers. On the Road, Miles & I dropped out to find the \"correct Time\". Before we started on the march I dashed down to the Photogrs & got the remainder of the Photos. Arrived Steenvoord about 6 p.m.\n\nSteenvoorde\n","307":" Last night I slept next to Billgy May, on the cold hard floor of the Barn. Luckily there was plenty of straw. We left the Farm, where we billeted immediately after Break. & marched through Poperinghe where our Nursing Section have taken over the D.R.S. The Bearers were soon set to work, sorting out poles & Tents & pitching them. \n","308":" I was enjoying a nice sleep this morning. The rest of the chaps in my Tent all got up & had Break. but I though a few more minutes sleep would do me more good. Was just rolling over to sleep on when Serg. Mathieson came into the Tent & informed me that I was Orderly Corporal. Talk about being busy – I was rushed off my legs – & on top of it all I had the Photos to give out. Just after dinner I was sent away in charge of 30 discharged Tommies to report to the R.T.O. at Poperinghe Station. It was a rotten march as we had to thread our way through the traffic - & there was some traffic. Guns, ammunition, Ambulances, motor Bikes & the Lord knows what. We got to the Station alright, but the R.T.O. refused to take them over, so we had to return to the Rest Camp. \n\n \nWesthock Ridge Pill Box\n \n","309":" \n\nThe Bearers moved away on our way into the Line again. We arrived at a nest of dug-outs along side the Ypres-Comines Canal.\n","310":" Had very little sleep last night. For one thing an overcoat only is hardly sufficient to keep one warm. I left my Blankets behind in my Pack. Slept next to Bluey Roberts, the chap who arrived from Base with Roy Wooler. We turned out about 4.15, & had Break. which was brought up in an Ambulance. Tea & Porridge. It was very acceptable. We walked along to Shrapnel Corner & got aboard motor lorries, which took us through YPRES to our A.C.S. It was a most interesting trip, as we saw the remains of the Cathedral & the famous Cloth Hall. They are now only a heap of ruins. From the A.C.S. we came along to the Left R.A.P. with a load of stretchers. There were dead horses & mules everywhere & it gave us a gentle reminder that a War was on. \n\nWe saw 2 Aeroplanes brought down, one of ours & one of Fritz’s. The general opinion was that they banged into one another. \n\nAfter fossicking around for a while we got orders to send \n26\n 16 men out to relieve the Reg. Bearers.\n\nPill Box R.A.P. 28 Batt. Capt. Harper. We had to remove about a dozen dead Germans before we took over the Pill Box. It is very strongly built of re-inforced concrete. The walls are about 2 ft 6 thick. It is about 18 feet square & about 6 ft high. The roof is built of iron girders & about 4 feet of concrete on top of that. Visited various other Pill Boxes in the vicinity in search of souvenirs. Found a few, but a crowd of Infantry got in before us & had their pick.\n\nFriday. Sept. 21st Fritz is shelling like Hell & our chaps are getting knocked all over the place. Bert Berry was wounded in the Head & back. Smee got a small piece of shell in the back of the neck. Roy Wooler got a knock in the knee, & Dickson was wounded. Bradley is missing & his case looks serious, as his Pay Book & Steel mirror were picked up with a shell hole through ‘em. We missed him when we arrived at the Pill Box, but thought he had only lost his way. \n\n22 Batt. M.O. relieved the 28th \n\nCapt. Orr. About 7, the 22 Batt. Med. Off. & his details changed over, & made this as uncomfortable as they could for us. \n\n We put in a couple of hours trying to clean up the place. It was in an awful mess. There was about 2 feet of water on the Floor & it stank awfully. The dead Fritz’s outside were beginning to \"pong\" & we were very pleased when the Pioneers came along & buried them. There was a German Red x chap went through, wounded. He was in the dug out when we took over. He gave me his Medical Outfit, which I was going to bring back as a souvenir, but somebody got down on it, as they also did to a trench dagger I got from a Pill Box away over from ours. We were well supplied with rations, but it was hard not being able to light a Fire & make some Tea.\n\nWesthoek Ridge\n","311":" Misty but fine. Fritz tried very hard to knock our Pill Box in --- but am jolly glad to say he failed. He put 2 shells right on top, but it only shook ‘em off & we are still going strong. A good few wounded came through & we were kept busy. We had Breakfast as well as possible under the circs. About 8 a.m. the 1st F. Amb. came to relieve us & never were they more welcome, as things were getting most uncomfortable around our Pill Box. We marched back along the Menin Road to our A.C.S. where we got aboard motor Lorries & returned to our H.Q, at Poperinghe. It was a very pleasant surprise to go back & we greatly appreciated the good dinner that awaited us. We also had a hot shower & clean change of clothes. After Tea we had an Investiture of the Bottes.\n","312":" Woke up this morning feeling refreshed after a good night’s sleep & the Bath. Had Break. at 7. Fell in at 8 & came away in motor lorries to Ypres, where we now are awaiting orders. Yesterday I got \na\n Letters from Mrs Ibbs & Ruth, containing that postcard of M.S. which I was so anxious to get. As we passed along in the Lorries we met a number of Belgians on their way to Church. It struck me – what a contrast. They were on their way to a Peaceful gathering, & we were on our way to join in the bloomin’ argument with Fritz. We are camped in a big dug-out, which is built near the Town Square. The entrances are cut through what was once the city walls. It is about 6ft thick & built of brick. It has accommodation for about 1000 men. Bricky & I took a stroll round the town, but as Fritz was sending over a few souvs. we returned.\n","313":" Reveille at 6 Break. at 7. A sec. went into the Line last night. B sec. went to the A.C.S. along the Menin Rd. & did Fatigues. Collecting Petrol Tins & burning them out for water. It was a glorious day & there were hundreds of planes about. We had dinner about 1 oclock & after a spell resumed the \"cleaning up\" operations. C section came out to us, but were sent out to the Line with Blankets & stretchers. Fritz put a number of shells over near us, but none of us were hit. Some of our crowd were carting away the clothes of Gassed Patients & Bricky is loaded with souvenirs. They say the stunt is not coming off till Wed. morning. We returned to our quarters in the redoubt about 6.30 & found that B sec of the 15th were all down with diarrhoea.\n\nMenin Road\n","314":" Turned out at 4. Break at 5. Then we went out to the A.C.S. along the Menin Rd. We left for the Line about 6. The road was teeming with Traffic & looking straight down the road was one of Fritzs Balloons. An A.A. Gun was passing along & we were going in single file down past it, when a shell lobbed right alongside it. When the smoke cleared away we picked up poor old Phil Murray. He was riddled with shrapnel & was just alive, but he died just as he reached the dressing station. McGoldrick got a knock in the back, & Mole got one in the arm. Dickson was also wounded. It’s a wonder they were not all killed. After a little delay we resumed our Journey. I must say that most of us \"had the wind up\". Fritz put a few more shells in the road as we passed along, blowing up 5 motor lorries & a number of horses, but very few men were hit which was very remarkable.\n\nMenin Road\n\nTues. Sept. 25 (cont) We got out to Hooge Tunnel without further loss. The motor lorries were all ablaze, & we got past them at the \"toots\" as they were such a good mark for Fritz. & he put his \"big stuff\" over thick & heavy. There were plenty of wounded coming thro & we were kept busy. Just near where poor Phil got knocked was \"Hell Fire Corner\" & never was a place better named. We had to carry about 1½ miles to the A.D.S. past the burning lorries & to add to the excitement, a dump caught fire, & Mills Bombs & cartridges were banging away in all directions. Bullecourt was bad enough, but it was a \"Home\" compared to this sport. One of our squads composed of Bill Hippersley, Lew Ballard, Mat Doyle, & Henry Mercer, got about 50 yds away from out dug out with a Patient, when a shell dropped among them. It blew poor old Mat & Lew & the patient to pieces, \n\n Hooge Tunnel & Crater \n\nblew one of Henry’s legs off, & slightly injured Bill Hippersley. Poor old Mercer died soon after reaching the dressing station. Soon after this \"Towny\" got his right hand badly smashed. \n\nOur list of casualties was getting very high. It was a great relief to get back to our Tunnel as it was very strongly built & one felt fairly safe inside it. It was built by the Germans & runs along for about 5 miles. Fritz used to bring his troops along it at one time. In places it is blown in, & now forms a series of very serviceable dug-outs. Owing to so many casualties we had plenty of rations. Wyn Arthur was the next to get a \"souvenir\" from Fritz. A small piece of shrapnel hit him in the shoulder. It was not serious & after they had dressed him at the A.D.S. they sent him back to duty, as we were so short of men.\n\nTues. Sept. 25 (cont) I took his place with A. Butler, B. W. Howard & Ralph Watts. Just after he returned, Arthur Butler made a casualty of himself by drinking about ½ a pint of kerosene in mistake for water, so I still continued to carry with the squad, Wyn taking Arthur’s place. During the day Sgt Mathieson took a number of squads & formed a relay post, down at the crater. This improved matters a lot, as it halved the distance we had to carry. The 60th Batt. went into the Line at midday & we got a few of them through. Fritz kept shelling heavily & we were kept busy. We were \"No 7\" squad, & the Figure 7 will linger long in my memory. At night a bright moon shone, & made things good for us, as it is terrible to carry over shell riddled ground in the dark.\n\nThe 54th & 56 Batt. went up during the night. They were sitting along the road as we passed by with a stretched case. A shell burst among them, killing & wounding quite a number including a M.O. & an officer. Ted Grey, Eli Dodson & a number of others came along to give us a hand. Things got a bit quiet & we had a spell of about 2 hours. \n\nAt about 5 on","315":" we got another carry. Things were very rough & shells were bursting in all directions. We arrived at Hooge Crater safely, but found that it was badly knocked about. A number of dug-outs had been blown in & quite a lot of dead were lying about. Ralph Watts & I were just lifting our Patient into the Y.M.C.A, canteen when a shell burst right behind us. I got a bit of it in my thigh & a chap named West 1745. A. Coy. 31 Batt. who came down with us as a walking case, got a crack on the Jaw. He was already wounded in the chest. \n","316":" (cont) Ralph also got a piece in his leg, but it only grazed the skin. He fixed up my leg & also put a bandage on Westy. As soon as things got a bit quiet I hobbled along to the D.S. on the Menin Road. In the excitement I took the wrong turning & wandered through the wood, where a lot of our big guns were. Just as I was hit our barrage started. It was a beauty, & very quickly silenced Fritz’s Guns. On my way to the D.S. I met a couple of other chaps slightly wounded, & we got aboard the first car we met & went to the M.D.S. Here I saw Sgt. Seymour & Maj. North dressed my wound. From here we went by motor lorry to the Can C.C.S. Our crowd were at the D.R.S. opposite & very soon came to see me. Maj. Wooster, Mac, Brian Aspinall & a whole crowd of ‘em. Bill Gamble brought me Tobacco & Cigarettes.\n\nIN HOSPITAL\n\nAt the C.C.S. they gave us Porridge, Biscuits & Cocoa. Then we were put aboard the Hosp. Train & brought to No 22. Gen. Hosp. Camieres Here we changed our clothes & had a Hot Bath, which was most refreshing. I was very soon asleep, & did not wake up till the Orderly brought round Break. on THURS. 27 \n\nAm in A 10 Ward. It is a big marquee & has 60 Beds. It is an American Hospital & the nurses & staff look after us well. We had Porridge, with plenty of milk, but no sugar, bread & Butter & Tea. At 10 the Doctor came round. He marked me for X Ray. I went down after dinner, but they were too busy, so I’ll have to wait till tomorrow. After Tea the Yanks played Baseball. It was quiet thrilling to watch. Wrote Letter 35 to B.E. also wrote to Mother & sent whizz-bangs to Ruth & Mrs Sam. \n","317":" We get a good view from our ward. There is a pretty range of Hills right ahead. The weather is glorious, & its fine to be able to sit back in Bed & be made a fuss of by the Nurses, especially after Hell Fire Corner. \n\nI went down & got X rayed after Break. They found a piece of shrap still in my Leg, so I’ll be getting it taken out as soon as the serious cases are gone through. 6 chaps went away to Blighty tonight, including West, the chap who shared the shell with me. Hope I get there soon.\n","318":" A number of cases came into our ward during the night. They say that our fellows gained all their objectives & have dug themselves in, so that means Fritz won’t get it back again. Polygon Wood is in our hands. We have heard a lot about that lately. Cis’s Birthday. Weather continues good. A number of cases were marked \"Blighty\" this morning & they are very joyful. The food is pretty good in this Hospital. The doc. had a look at my leg this morning & says it is going on very nicely.\n\nSun.Sept. 30. The Band played near our ward today & made things quite cheerful & lively. Doc. says the piece of shrap. will have to be removed – the sooner the better, I say. The chap in the next Bed to me had his eye (left) taken out today. It was badly knocked about with shrapnel. W.G. Ray. 4152 D31 Bt He is quite cheerful about it.\n\n 22 Gen. Hospital\n","319":" Another month gone & the war seems as far off the end as it did a year ago. The doctor made a thorough exam. of every patient in the ward this morning. After he had looked at my Leg, he told Sister not to give me any Break. tomorrow, so that looks as if he is going to operate. Good Job too. I don’t fancy getting around the country with a lump of shrapnel in my carcase.\n","320":" No Break this morning. At about 10.30 they sent for me to go to \"the Pictures\". I came round just as dinner was on, but didn’t feel like eating any. My leg is jolly sore, but I don’t mind that so long as I get to \"Blighty\". A Sgt. Major Metcalf of the 60 Batt. is in the next Bed to me. His Jaw is badly smashed. \n\n A 10 WARD\n","321":" Gee! I got quite a shock this morning when I saw the Gash they had made in my leg. It gave me L too when Sister Cummings was dressing it. The Doctor happened to come round while I was being dressed & he marked me H.S.B. which means \"Hospital Ship – Bed.\" All I want now are the magical Letters A.P. which is the signature of Sir Alan Perry, O.C. the Hospital; then I’m right for Blighty.\n","322":" Last night the wind blew a hurricane. This morning Sir Alan came around & marked my Ticket, Hooray. Now I must rest my soul in patience till I get over to dear old Blighty. Just after Tea the Serg. brought round my clothes. A suit of pyjamas, a flannel shirt, pair of socks – (one of ‘em I couldn’t get on) cap comforter & sweater.\n\n Bed 54\n","323":" Last night I put on my Blighty clothes & sat up in Bed till about 2 a.m. I heard the motors buzzing around, & thought, \"Oh, they’ll be here for me presently\". After that I dozed off to sleep & was awakened by the night orderly at about 5 bringing round the water to wash. It appears there was no evacuation last night, so now I must hope for better luck tonight. Another big crowd of wounded arrived & the ward is almost full again. After Break. the Charge Sister brought her tray around & dressed my leg. After the operation they put a wad of lint in the wound to prevent it from healing too quickly. This morning this had to be removed. It was a ticklish job, but Sister Sharpe was as gentle as a lamb & it was soon over. They took the Serg. Maj. away for his operation & afterwards took him to another ward. He went crook about it, too.\n\n A.10 Wd. Camieres\n\nThis is the Operation Ward where the chaps are brought after visiting the Pictures. Some of them say very amusing things when they are under Ether, & we get plenty of laughs. Hope to goodness I get away to Blighty tonight. One thing certain, I cannot get any better treatment, anywhere, than I am getting in this A 10 Ward. What a good long letter I’ll be able to write to B.E. when I get over. Our chaps continue to give Fritz Hell, which is certainly good news. And they are holding all the ground they took. -- About 1.30 a.m. on\n","324":" the stretcher bearers arrived to take me away to Blighty. They carried me down to the Orderly Tent & from there they took us away in Amb. Cars to the Hosp. Train. Here I was put in a Bunk. The Train was staffed by V.A.D’s, & they looked after us well. The Train left about 4.30, They \n\ngave us Cocoa & B’d & Butter twice during the trip. We arrived at Calais at about 11 a.m. From the train we were taken aboard the Hosp. Ship. They had a big crowd of Fritzs to unload us. It was quite a novelty to be carried by the Huns. \n\nThe name of the ship was \"Pieter de Cominck\". It used to be a passenger boat running between Belgium & England. Just previous to the war, it was used by King Albert as a private yacht. She was beautifully fitted up. The bunks were quite luxurious. Snowy-white sheets & good warm Blankets. They gave us a good feed of very nice stew which went down well. We left Calais at 2.15 & arrived in Dover about an hour later, after a good crossing. From the ship we were put aboard another Hospital Train. It was quiet luxurious, also, & I began to think that getting wounded was not the worst thing in the world, by any means.\n\n Royal Sussex County Hospital\n\nAs we passed through the various stations en route, people waved their hands. (It is really surprising that after 3 years of war, they can still raise a certain amount of enthusiasm) We arrived at Brighton about 10 p.m. Here we were unloaded by V.A.D’s & put aboard Motor Amb. & brought away to this Hospital. It is a Civil Hospital, & things are much more \"free & easy\" than they are in a Military Hospital. They put me in a nice little Bed. Then 2 nurses came along & washed me & put a clean shirt on me. After that they brought along some Hot Milk & \nkissed me\n wished me \"Goodnight\". \n","325":" This morning the Nurse awoke me at 5 & brought along some warm water in which I washed. At 6 they brought\n\nSun. Oct. 7 Bristol Ward\n\nBreakfast along. We had a choice of Fish Cakes or Sausage Rolls. I had Cakes & with it Tea & Bread & Butter. At 9, they brought Hot Milk & Bread & Butter along. During the morning an old Gent paid us a visit. He came around & had a yarn with each of us, & gave us 6 penny stamps & a writing Pad each. Then a number of Ladies came along & took down our names & Home addresses. Another old gent brought some more stamps, & also gave us matches. Then the Matron brought us 2 packets of Cigarettes. About mid-day they dressed my wound. It is coming along very nicely. At 12.30 they brought Dinner. Roast Beef & Potatoes & Baked Apples & Rice. Very nice indeed. After Dinner an old lady brought us some very nice Home made scones.\n\nAfter Tea they sang Hymns in the next Ward. Matron played the Piano. She invited us all to join in the singing. I refrained, though the temptation was great. At 7 they brought us Hot milk. At 9.30 they put out the Lights & I went to sleep, after a very pleasant day.\n","326":" Since being in Hospital I have written to Stan Wright, Ruth B, Mrs Ibbs, Mrs Pudney & Sister Sharp, so ought to get some replies during the next few days. The Matron is a dear old Lady. She comes round every day & has a little talk with each of us. When the Nurse took the Bandage from my Leg this morning, she said \"Isn’t that Beautiful?\" It was the wound she meant, not my leg. That is far too skinny to be admired. It is jolly cold although the sun does shine at intervals. Wrote Letter 36 to B.E.\n\n Bed 23. Bristol Ward\n","327":" Sausages for Break. this morning, very nice too. My Doctor came round yesterday. He says they must wait till the incision in my Leg is healed & then have another go with the X Ray. The old Gent brought us some Acid drops today & a Lady brought us some small bags of Lavender, which makes the place smell very sweet.\n","328":" Received Letter from Ruth. She informs me that Mary is down here, & will come to see me, which is certainly good news. It is a beautiful day outside, but jolly cold indoors. Today we had Fish for Dinner, which was a pleasant change. They feed us up well at this place. Breakfast is the worst meal of the day. That is decidedly \"young\". Commenced Letter 37 to M.S.\n","329":" The nurses at this Hospital are the biggest lot of women I ever saw. They have arms on ‘em like the \"Village Blacksmith\". Got a Letter from Mary B. saying she is coming to see me, so I must spruce myself up. Yesterday 2 very nice Ladies came to see me. They were from the Red X, & brought me a heap of good things. A Tin of Tobacco & a Hair Brush among them. Just the 2 things I most needed. Mary arrived about 2.30. She brought me a bunch of beautiful Flowers. What a fine Girl she has grown into. I got quite a shock when I saw her. She stayed with me for about an hour, & we had a good old yarn about old times. Of course she wanted to know all about B.E. & I had to produce my Photos. Continued Epistle to M.S. No. 37.\n","330":" Yesterday \"Snowball\", Paddy & 3 others left the Ward & it seems very quiet this morning. More good news in the Paper. Hooray. I’ll soon be able to send home the magic word \"Pyjamas. Our Nurse was sent on duty to another ward, so we have to look after ourselves now. \"Canada\" broke the Phonograph, & things are all wrong. A Lady brought us some Nuts & Fruit, & another Lady played the Piano to us for a couple of Hours. Wrote to Ruth.\n","331":" Another glorious day. Got a \"bonser\" parcel of Apples & Pears from Lizzie. Received Letter & Photo from Ibby. Shall be jolly glad to get my mail from France.\n","332":" Fine sunny day. Wrote to L. Rowley. After dinner the place was overrun with visitors. All the chaps in our Ward are up, excepting \"Smithy\" & I. They pulled us out on the Verandah, where it was very pleasant, basking in the Sun. The 2 Ladies from the Red X came to see me & brought me some Papers. Smithy’s Girl & her Mother came to see him. They brought a Big Home Made Cake, to which we did full justice at Tea Time. There is plenty of Fruit about, & we are doing well. Tonight my Temp. is 101 & I feel rotten. Seems like a dose of Trench Fever. Nurse gave me a dose of Black Jack, which is awful.\n","333":" Spent a rotten night. Couldn’t sleep, & the Bandage slipped off my Leg. The night nurse fixed it up & brought me a Hot drink. Then I managed to drop off to sleep. Things are very comfortable in our Ward. We have a good fire burning night & day. A good number of visitors come around, & most of them bring something for the troops. Crawford went away today, that leaves us with only 8. We smoke & read & write Letters. War is seldom mentioned. After Tea the nurses gave us an excellent Concert in the Big Ward. The inmates of the \"old men’s Home\" were allowed to listen. The last thing I heard before dozing off was the massage Sister juggling with top C’s\n","334":" Bleak, dreary day. What a treat it is lay back in Bed & have one’s Break. brought to one. All the same I’d enjoy it more if the Botts were here to share the Fun. The Sister in charge of this Ward has been here 30 years. Gee! What a Life! \"Capstan\" Tobacco is very rough of late. I cannot smoke the Tin I got from the Red X, & I’m not very fastidious. It’s about time some mail arrived from France. I’ll be mighty glad to get it. The House doctor’s name is Holmwood. He comes from Essendon. We had a great old yarn. He asked if I had any \"Bulletins\", but I’m as anxious to get one as he is. Glory: Alleluia, the nurse gave me another Pill tonight. I’ll be posted \"missing\" one of these fine mornings. Wrote Letter 38 to B.E.\n","335":" Wet, dull day. Had a good read \"Smoke Bellew\". Doctor came round after Dinner, & marked me for X Ray. Red X Ladies brought Cigarettes & a \"Bulletin\". They stayed quite a while & we had a good old yarn. Received Letter from Ruth. They are expecting a Convoy in tonight & the Nurses & maids are rushing about like a Ration Party, carrying Blankets etc.\n","336":" 15 men came in last night. Judging by the excitement I thought there would be, at least, 100. The doc. came in during the night & borrowed my \"Bulletin\". I was X Rayed just before dinner. There is still a piece of shrapnel in my Leg. It shewed on the plate, so I guess that means they will make another cut. The Sister made my visit to the X Ray department quite interesting, as she explained to me the process. Whilst waiting for the lift to return me to the Ward I struck up a yarn with a Girl waiting to be X Rayed, & found out that she had been wounded by a Bomb which fell in London during an Air Raid. She was driving a Tram at the Time, & was injured in 6 places. As it was such a glorious day, they put \"Smithy\" & I out on the verandah. Wrote Aunt Nell & Mrs Pudney.\n","337":" Bit too cold to go out this morning. Received Post Card from Alec Blakeman. Poor old Butler our \"P.B.\" man went away this morning. Smithy & I will suffer for that. Things are much the same in Hospital, one day as the next. It makes one very lazy to be sitting back here & waited on hand & foot. They are a long time sending our mail over from France.\n","338":" Fine day, but cold. An old Lady came in this afternoon & said \"she was sorry she had no cakes left as she had given them all to the wounded soldiers,\" so she must think we are \"swinging it\". Sister Bristol informs us that we are having a Bun Fight & Concert on Tuesday, which is something to look forward to. Lizzie sent me another Box of Fruit.\n","339":" Buckland being away, \"Ginger\", the Generals daughter put Sgt. \"Bismuth\" on to collect the Washing Bowls, which caused a few smiles to ripple round the ward. Maj. Paley visited me yesterday & after seeing the X Ray plates, he decided to leave the piece of shrapnel in my leg. Had a jolly good dinner. Roast Beef & Veg. Baked apples & rice. Quite a lot of visitors came during the afternoon. Smithy’s Girl & her sister among them. They brought a Big Cake, which went down well at Tea time. We all went to Chapel after Tea, those who could not walk went in wheeled chairs. Nurse Jarrett tucked us well in with rugs. It is a beautiful little chapel with Pipe organ, & the service was most enjoyable. Afterwards Matron played the Hymns & we warbled in the ward.\n","340":" Another glorious day. Smithy & I went out on the verandah. Hooray, 4 Zepps brought down in France. That’s jolly good news. They did a lot of damage in London though beforehand. Mary Blakeman came to see me during the afternoon & stayed about 2 hours. Wrote Letter 40 to M.S. We are having a Bun Fight tomorrow & everyone is quite excited.\n","341":" Nurses & sisters & maids are all flying around preparing for tonight’s Feed. Boxes & Parcels of Good things are arriving in Big Quantities. At 3.30 Nurse Jarrett came round & started to get us ready. Packed us up in wheeled chairs & wrapped us well up in rugs. Then we were placed in position at the Tables. It was a great spread & we did full justice to the good things provided. A Lady paid for it all, & after one of our Sergts had made a little speech, thanking her, we were allowed to attack. \n\nThere were Tomatoes, Brown Bread & Butter (2\/11 a lb) Cakes of all kinds, Lollies & Chocolates & a Pkt of Cigarettes & Box Matches per man, & plenty of Sugar in the Tea & Meat Pies. Gee! what a Great Feed it was. The Food Controller would have had a Fit had he seen the Spread. After Tea we had a jolly good Concert. I sang the evergreen \"Spanish Onion\" which always seems to take. Sister Wicker gave us a number of songs in her usual charming style & Nurse Jarrett gave us quite a lot of twiddley stuff on her violin accomp’d by Nurse Wilson on the Piano. A Miss Grimshaw caused a lot of amusement by rendering a number of quaint songs\n","342":" What an exciting day. About 2 am the doctor came round & flashed his torch on each Bed. I wondered what was up. Later on the Nurses came & read out a list of names of men who were marked out. Almost everybody was going. Only Smithy (K.R.R.) & McLean (Niagara Falls) & myself were left in our ward. The Q.M. & her assistants were flying around with Blue suits & Pyjamas & the place was in an uproar. Smithy & I went out on to the verandah. I was just settling down to write to B.E. when Nurse Wilson came along & said \"Come on Moore, you’re next\". Gee! I did get a shock. There were no blue suits left so they dressed me up in a suit of pyjamas & a long blue coat. I look like Chu-Chin-Chow. Just after dinner they put us aboard the Cars & we came away to the 2nd Eastern Gen Hosp. \n\n Queen Mary Ward\n\nWe came right along the Sea Front & got a good view of the town, which is very fine. After a few hours messing around they brought us along to the Queen Mary Ward & we went to Bed again. It was visiting day & quite a number of Ladies came around & had a yarn. One of ‘em gave me a Bunch of very sweet grapes & a Girl gave me a Bun (After a thorough search I found 2 currants in it) At Tea Time they brought around a big lump of cake which one of the Nurses had made so we had quite a good feed.\n","343":" This morning the Doctor came round & had a look at us. Then one of the Nurses dressed my Leg. She was quite sore because I told her the wound was nearly healed. She probed it, & said it was not at all healed. Then she put about 2 ft of packing in it, so it looks as though I’m not going to walk on it yet for a few days. Com. Letter 41\n\n Queen Mary Ward\n","344":" What glorious weather & this October. It’s more like our Spring weather at Home. No mail arrived yet. I can’t make out what’s gone wrong. Nurse irrigated my wound this morning & made quite a fuss of it. We had 3 parsons to see us after dinner. I haven’t much time for them on the whole but these were 3 of the best I ever met. It was quite a treat to talk to them. For Tea we had an Egg, B’d & Butter & Cake, quite a good Feed.\n","345":" An orderly came round & informed Corduer & I that we are going to Harefield on Monday, & took down our sizes for clothes. Nurse Walker who dresses my Leg, got news to say she must stand in readiness to go to East Africa. A jolly fine nurse she is too.\n","346":" This is visiting day, so I gave my Hair an extra few minutes brushing. They brought our clothes around ready for our removal tomorrow. Good Lord! What news in the Paper. 60000 Italians & 400 Guns captured. Another Russian \"sell evidently\". The \"dagoes\" didn’t put up a Fight at all. Later. Very few visitors came. A Lady brought us a lovely cake which we had for Supper.\n","347":" Got into our Khaki again this morning. Went by car to Brighton station & from there by Train to Victoria, London. Here another car met us, & drove us past Buckm Palace to Paddington. Here we had Cocoa & Sandwiches at the Free Buffet. From Paddn we went by Train to Hendon. There we went by car to the Hospital, changed our Khaki for Blue once more & went to Bed. Glory Alleluia Big mail at last. Wrote Letter to Cis.\n","348":" 3y Ward. Yesterday, just as we were bidding the Nurses \"Goodbye\", they handed me a big mail from France. 23 Letters, so as soon as I got settled in Bed, I had a glorious old read. They were from Mother, France, Cis, Kath, Nell, & 6 from B.E. Gee! it made my head whirl to read all that lot. In answer to my Letters from England & about M.M. I’ll be kept busy now with writing Letters. Today I started on a cushion cover for Lill, but I’m wondering if I’ll be in Hosp. long enough to finish it. It is a very pretty design. The Food is pretty good here but they don’t make much fuss of a man. It’s more like a hardening Camp than a Hosp. Cordner. 36 Batt. is also busy on a Cushion. He comes along to my Bed at intervals during the day & we compare the amount of work done.\n\n No. 1 Aust. Aux. Hosp.\n","349":" The weather is glorious, & from what I’ve seen of it, the country is very pretty round here. Yesterday, Sister applied Blue Stone to my wound & it has burnt away all the proud Flesh. They seem to have a Board here about every other day & many get marked for Australia. I don’t envy some of them as they will never be much good. I put in a Busy day at my Cushion Cover. It will take a long time to do, but Gingos is worth it. Wrote to France & Nell. \n","350":" Carried on the Good work with the Badge & wrote Letter 42 to B.E. Also P. Cards to Payney & Stan Wright. Miserable, wet day. Leg not looking too good. 5 weeks today since I got hit. \n","351":" Received Parcel of things out of my Pack from Bill Gamble. My leg is looking rotten the doctor told them to put a tube in it & dress twice a day. They also took away a sample of the discharge, so I’m tipping the next thing will be another operation. Put in a good day at my Cushion Cover. Got Letter from Mary B. Wrote to Mother.\n","352":" The weather is glorious, a bit cold inn the mornings, but warming up towards mid-day. A number of visitors came round after dinner.\n\nSun. \nOCT\n","353":" Received Box of Cigarettes & Letter from Bacup Got up after dinner & went down the villages on crutches. Plenty of visitors flying about & a convoy of patients arrived. The village is pretty but awfully quiet. A chap came round & took Photo of ward. I gave him Polly Mincher trio to take copies from.\n","354":" Wet, windy day. Stayed in Bed & carried on the Good work with Cushion Cover. Wrote Mrs Ibbs. Bacup.\n","355":" Weather brightened up. Went out on crutches again, but my bloomin’ Hat is too small & it makes my head ache. Wrote Mrs Pudney. Chap brought postcards of ward, not Bad. What the dickens to write about I don’t know but this Book must be filled up somehow. There was a Concert on tonight, but I had to wait for my Leg to be dressed, & by that time it was too late. Another new doctor this morning, that makes 3 now, in a week. I don’t like this Hospital at all & shall be mighty glad to get away. The doctor said there was only one thing to do with my Leg, & that was to remove the piece of shell.\n","356":" Things are kept going in this Ward & the sisters certainly earn their pay. As soon as a Bed is vacated, another patient comes along & fills it. The photor brought along the enlargets of the Polly Mincher photo, & they turned out real good. Wrote to Aunt Nell. If Mrs A.J. doesn’t appreciate the good work I have put on her cushion cover then she ought to.\n\nThur. 8. Was X rayed again this morning for the 3rd time. So now I can look forward to the Pictures again. Four chaps in our ward were operated on today. I got up quite early & dressed, but it was too wet to go out. After Tea went to Concert which was most enjoyable.\n\n","357":" Anniversary\n","358":" Col. came round & examined all Bed Patients. Told sister to remove Tube from my Leg. Put in a good few hours on cushion cover. Received Amiens Photos & parcel of post cards from Ted Grant also Letter from Maj. Payne.\n","359":" Two years ago today since I bade them \"Goodbye\" on Melbourne Wharf. 8 months in Egypt, & 16 months among the mud & shells of Flanders & Belgium. Considering the number of men who are dead, I really should consider myself lucky to be alive. Let us hope that it won’t last another year or we shall all be old men before our time. Went to Concert after Tea, which was pretty good. Sgt. Fowler, 20 Batt. in the next Bed to me got a parcel today, containing a Home Made Loaf & some dairy Butter, which was quite a Luxury.\n\nCommenced Letter 43 to M.S. \n","360":" Finished off Letter 43. After dinner went for stroll. Met Charlie Whitaker. He was gassed at Ypres, & has been here about a week. It is quite a coincidence that we should be in Blighty together again, as we came over on leave last May. A good crowd of visitors are here today. \n","361":" Letter from Bill Gamble. Another new M.O, that makes 3 since I’ve been in this Hospital. He looked at my Leg this morning & said the same old thing \"Oh we will wait till that wound heals up a bit\". Yesterday the Surgeon came round all wards & looked at every case a good number were marked out. This afternoon I attended the Picture Show & Bun Fight in the Concert Hall. It passed the time well & we had a good feed of Cake etc.\n","362":" Got Letters from France & Mary B. My wound is looking a lot better this morning. The Lady from the Red X saw my cushion cover today & said I must put it in the Comp. which comes off next Friday. Charley Whitaker came in to say \"Hooray\". He went away on Furlough. The Lights are rotten in this ward. I intended to write Letters, but went to the Concert instead, which was very good.\n","363":" Well what the deuce am I going to write about? I’m hanged if I know. It just seems a matter of eat, drink & sleep. The cushion cover is almost finished. The chap (Bandy Joe) came round & took our photos. All my money goes on Photos & stamps. I’m broke again now & haven’t got a writing Pad otherwise would write some Letters. Have got quite a lot to answer.\n","364":" Finished off my cushion cover for M.S. Hope she will appreciate the many Hours I spent on it. Got Letter from Rex Herford. 14 more Military Medals. Our unit will soon be all M.Ms & N.C.Os. After Dinner, donned my blues, struggled into a Collar & Tie & went for a stroll down the village. Met Steeley & we went for a walk along the Road. The Trees are shedding their Leaves & they make quite a carpet of the Roads.\n","365":" This afternoon there was an Exhibition of Needle work done by Patients. Some of it was beautifully done. Mr Leek, to whom this House & Land belongs, presented the Prizes. Afterwards we all had Afternoon Tea with him in the Rec. Room. My cushion cover was on view, but did not gain a Prize.\n","366":" This morning the Col. (Shaw) came round & probed my wound for some minutes. Then he marked me for X Ray again. Received Parcel from Mrs Pudney containing Letters & a number of Photos of Lill & Nell at various ages.\n","367":" Was X rayed. They painted a big black cross on my Leg, so if I don’t pull through the Op. I’ll be alright for Christian Burial. After dinner Steeley & I went for a stroll down the village Lanes. There was quite a crowd of visitors but no one came to see me. After Tea, Sister gave a dose of oil & shaved my Leg in preparation for the \"Hop Over\" tomorrow.\n","368":" Glory Alleluia. Got a mail from Home this morning & a Letter from France. She seems to like Egypt. A good long Letter from Mother & a 9 Page Epistle from Mrs A.J. Great Kid that. Had Break at 4 a.m. It is 10.30 now & I am awaiting the Arrival of a stretcher to convey me to \"The Pictures.\"\n\nLater Feeling very weak & dopey. Vomited. Had 2 Inj of Morp.\n","369":" Still very dopey. Can’t eat or sleep.\n","370":" Ate Chicken & drank milk Leg looking rotten & feeling so too. Steeley sat on my Bunk & related a few Experiences. Very amusing, made me feel better. Received Photo of France. A Beauty.\n","371":" Cracked Joke with night sister. Feeling bit better. Leg a bit easier. Enjoyed dinner. Chicken not so springy as usual. Some days it is almost too much to handle, single handed.\n","372":" Got another Letter from M.S. 9 more Pages. Good old Girl. My hand is too shaky to write but I must certainly make up when I’m a bit stronger. They must have taken the piece of shell out of my Leg with an Axe, judging by the way it feels. Sister Davies was to have gone on leave, but I’m glad she did not, as she has looked after my Leg real well.\n","373":" Nothing exciting to write about. The crowd who are returning on the Hospital Ship are busy getting their Gear together.\n","374":" What a night last night was. Wind blowing a Hurricane. The Hospital ship party had to turn out about 4 a.m. & have Break. Only 3 are going from this ward, Wilkie, Hill & Garland. They are all badly knocked about, & much as I long to get Home I prefer to wait a bit longer & go back in one piece. It snowed & hailed & rained all day. At times the sun would break thro’ buy not for long. Wrote Letter 44 to Lill.\n","375":" Sister Davies went away on Furlough today. My Leg is coming on well, but I still feel confoundedly weak. Am putting in some good work at my Cover for Writing Pad. We have a very nice Sister to look after us now, & the tucker has improved a bit this last few days. Steeley brought me some Jelly which went down very well.\n","376":" What the dickens to write about I don’t know. Am afraid my diary is getting rather a Farce, as nothing happens nowadays to write about. After Tea write France\n","377":" Gee! what’s gone wrong? Sister Williams gave me a glass of Port Wine today. Our poor old Kangaroo is showing signs of the times. He lays about all day near the Steam Pipe at the Laundry. No doubt the poor beggar is longing for the Sun just as much as the rest of us. After Tea wrote to Mother.\n","378":" This time last year we were on the Somme, up to our necks in mud. It is very pleasant to lay back in Bed & think about the rough times we have had. My Leg is healing up well.\n","379":" Got an awful shock this morning when Georgie brought me a Bottle of Stout. I ought to soon get well now, what with that & the chicken. Serg. Fowler got marked for Furlough today. Stan Wright did not turn up. I guess London is proving too attractive. Com. Letter 45.\n","380":" There is a lot of talk about another Hosp. Ship returning shortly & it is causing much excitement. Capt. Fox our M.O. is flying round making out Board Papers. He’s got everybody guessing. Finished Letter to Lill.\n","381":" Capt. Fox made out Board Papers for nearly everyone in the ward. He marked me B2b, but I am not holding out much hope. Sgt. Fowler is going away tomorrow.\n","382":" Fowler went away this morning & Sailor went to London with him. The Board came round & examined us. Capt. Fox pushed my Case a hard as he could, but I only managed to get B1b, which ought to mean a few months in Blighty, so I must consider myself Lucky as I never expected to get a Board at all.\n","383":" Things much the same. Weather jolly cold. We sit round the Fire & tell yarns, & smoke. My Blotter Cover is nearly finished.\n","384":" Serg. Rolfe, Woods & Watkins went away to Weymouth today. Finished my Fancy Work. Com. Letter No. 46.\n","385":" Fearfully cold. Another Air Raid over London. Not much damage done, & two Gothas brought down. Wrote France & Sam Ibbs & finished Letter 46 to B.E.\n\n F. S. S. M. T. W. T.\n","386":" 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 \n\nThings about the same.\n","387":" Sister Cummings went away today & Sister Davies came back. She will no doubt shake things up. The first thing was to mark a number of us to have our meals at the Mess Hut, which is rather hard this cold weather. Capt. Fox continues in good humour. He has nickname for us all. I am \"The Professor\".\n\nCom. Letter No 47 to M.S.\n","388":" Great excitement in the Ward. 9 of our family were issued with their Khaki, in prep. For going away by the hospital Ship tomorrow.\n","389":" Packed up cushion cover & Photo & gave to Rex Rodd, to take back with him on the Hospital Ship; for Mother. Also sent Photo to France. Went down to Mess Hut for my first meal. It is not at all Bad, nice & warm & cheerful & we get the tucker hot. Old Bandy brought the Photo along. It is really good. Now I have to raise 15\/- to pay for it. Spoke to Capt Fox about getting a trip on the transport back Home. He rushed down to the Registrar’s Office where he put up a good argument, but they informed me that only C class men were taken on for those Jobs, so my chances of seeing Lill are again at a very low level. Anyhow I finished Letter 47 & posted it\n","390":" Cold, wet, snowy day. Very few visitors. I sat in the Canteen eating Cakes & drinking weak Tea. Old \"Bandy\" brought the Picture along of Lill & I, but I didn’t have the money to pay for it, so he will have to wait till I’ve seen the Registrar.\n","391":" One of the Red X Ladies promised to sew my Blotter Cover, so I took it down to the Sewing Room & left it. She didn’t have enough material to finish it, but promised to do it for Wednesday. Jolly good Concert in Hall. \"The Cheer-ohs\" All Girls.\n","392":" Got another Letter from France, also Snapshot. She looks well & seems to be enjoying Life in Egypt. Weather awfully cold & frosty. We sit round the Fire like a lot of Sick Fowls.\n","393":" They finished Lill’s Blotting Pad & it looks fine. Felt in a writing Humour so wrote to Mother & Mrs Pudney. Last night the Lights were switched off about 8 p.m. as a number of German planes came over, but the papers say they did no damage.\n","394":" Tom Effie, Steeley & I walked as far as Denham station. It is 2 ½ miles from Harefield, the furthest I have walked since I got hit, & my leg ached somewhat.\n","395":" There are prizes offered for the best decorated wards & competition is keen. The nights are moonlight & Fritz ought to be pleased.\n","396":" Most of the fellows are busy getting holly & other Green stuff with which to decorate the wards. We got in a good supply.\n\nComm. Letter No 48\n\nGot Letter from Aunt Nell. What an exciting diary this is. Main items: Eat, drink, sleep & dressings.\n","397":" Few visitors out today, but very few. Weather too cold. Some of the wards have commenced to decorate for Xmas. There is a Prize of £ 2 for the best decorated ward. Finished L 48\n","398":" Busy day decorating Ward. It looks very pretty. A gang of Kids from the village came round singing Carols, but they made such an awful din, that we we glad to give them a few coppers to get rid of ‘em. Capt. Fox has left our ward & Mendelsohn has taken his place. He gave us a thorough overhauling & marked about a dozen of us for Furlough. I am marked to go out next Thursday so will spend Xmas in this beautiful place.\n","399":" Sausages & Bacon for Breakfast. Started the day well. During the morning we were all given a neat little leather writing Case from the Y.M.C.A. Got a few letters from Ruth, Lizzie & Mrs Sam Ibbs, & some Cigarettes. At 12.30 we had Dinner. The Dining Hall was very nicely decorated & cloths on the table. We had Turkey & Ham, & plenty of Vegetables. Plum Pudding, very nice too. Champagne & Cider to drink. Fruit, Nuts, Chocolate & Lollies. I felt too full for words when I left. As we left the Hall we were each handed a Box from the Red X, containing Pipe, Tobacco, Cigs, H’d kerchief, Choc & Match Box. During the afternoon there was a Jolly Good Concert.\n","400":" The Fancy Work Exhibition took place today. There were a good number of entries. My Blotter got First Prize for the Best Original Work. Col. Yeatman the O.C. presented the Prizes. Mine was a Writing Case, with Ink Bottle, Calendar, Scribbling Block attached. Quiet a nice present if a man was at Home, but useless to a soldier. I gave it to Sister Davies. My marching papers came not in today so I won’t be going out tomorrow.\n","401":" Enquired at Registrars about getting away tomorrow & also about drawing some money. Fixed things up alright. Sent Wire to Ibby to say I’d meet him at Liverpool St. at 3.30\n","402":" About a foot of snow on the Ground. We had to stand in it for about an hour waiting for our Kit to be issued. Went by car to station. Train left about 10. Arrived London about 10.35. Went by car to Horseferry Road. Here we were lectured on various topics & after a long wait at the Pay Office we draw our few pounds. I had a note from the Registrar to draw an extra £ 5, but the Paymaster would not hear of it. I drew £ 4 out of my Pay Book & £ 2.16\/- Ration money. It is not much for 14 days Furlough, but I must make the best of it. We had a cup of Tea & Sausage Rolls before leaving H.Q.\n\nFri. 28 (cont.) After leaving the Pay Office Syd Hodges & I went over to the War Chest Club, where we got a good 3 course meal for 1\/-. Then I went down to Liverpool St Station to meet Sam Ibbs. Had to wait some time for his Train to arrive, so went for a stroll. Purchased pair of Gloves 10\/6 & attache case 7\/6 one £ gone. Met Ibby. He looks very well & the uniform of the R.N.A.S suits him. Went & had a Feed, then caught the Train to Stone. We had a great old yarn coming down in the Train. 11½ years since we saw each other so we found plenty to talk about. \n\nArrived Stone about 8.30. Sam’s wife & Kiddy & sister were there to meet us. Sam’s Mother greeted us warmly & after a warm by a roaring Fire, Sam’s wife dished us out a good Feed of Tripe & Onions, which went down well. Then we sat around the Fire, & had a good old yarn. Ibby’s wife is a very nice person, & a thorough Business woman. She was very much interested in Lill’s picture & said I was lucky – why, of course I am. We went to Bed about 11. Here I discovered a hot water bottle which made good company, & I slept peacefully by its side till about 8 on \n\nSat. 29. when I was awakened by Fanny Buckley bringing me a cup of Tea. After that I got up & had Breakfast. Then we all went\n","403":" For a stroll until Dinner Time.\n","404":" Spent a quiet morning by the Fire telling yarns. After dinner we went for a walk to Ern Harvey’s. At night we went to Church, St Michaels. Ibby & I paid a visit to Mr Clough’s where he showed us St. Michaels Roll of Honour, on which Sam’s & my name appeared. Wrote Letter 49\n\nMon. 31. Ibby had to return to Felixstowe this morning, so his wife & I saw him off at the Station. He only had 3 days Leave. His wife is staying till Wed. morning, so I am staying on to keep her company. Mrs Ibbs, Fanny Buckley, Jenny Ibbs & I sat up & saw the old year out.\n\n","405":" New Year’s Day. Last night, at about 10 to 12, I went outside, so that when the clock struck 12, I could walk in, & wish ‘em a Happy New Year\". Stayed outside about 20 minutes then they came & told me that the Clock did not strike after 7. Good Joke.\n\nThis is Market day in Stone, but very quiet to what it was in the old days. Stone is very quiet. Mrs Ibbs & Jenny & I went to a Whist Drive & had a most enjoyable time. At every table I met someone I knew. There were some jolly nice Girls there. I never dreamed that Stone had so many Girls. They all called me Jack till they found out that I was married, then it was \"Mr Moore\". B.E. will always do me anyhow.\n","406":" After Break. I went all over Stone in search of a horse & trap, so that we could go for a Drive, but there was not one in the Town. We went into Hanley to see the Pantomime \"Tommy Tucker.\" It was rotten. We sat in the Orchestra Stalls, & it was awfully cold. To make matters worse I sat near the Trombone Player, & every time he played a loud note he nearly blew me out of my seat. We returned to Stone about 5.30. Called in at Pat Astbury’s & had Tea. Then we got the Phonograph going & stayed on & yarned till about 9. Then we had Supper & returned to St Michael’s Lodge. I was jolly tired & glad to get to Bed. Bywe I mean Mrs Ibbs, Harry & I. This for B.E’s information. No doubt I’ll hear about it later.\n","407":" Went to the Potteries to Harry Ibbs’ place. Meat was unprocurable in the Town so we had a \"makeshift\" dinner, a thing I enjoy more than a set meal. Said \"Goodbye\" to Mrs Ibbs, Harry & Fanny & returned to Stone. Met Ern Harvey & went Home with him. Mrs Harvey was very nice & made me feel quite at Home. Slept in a big double Bed with only a Hot water bag for company.\n","408":" Paid a visit to \"Crown & Anchor\" Saw Fred Collier & his wife; & of course many other identities. Harry Jones & his wife among them. While Ibby was in Stone, we had our photos taken together but they turned out failures. There’s no doubt about it, I take a rotten photo. At night had a Game Cribbage & a Sing-Song up at Ern’s place.\n","409":" Got Mr Jacks to take a few copies of the enlargement, as it is too big to send Home to M.S. I don’t get up in the morning till about 11. The weather is too jolly cold. Ern & I went to a Dance at St Michael’s Institute but I got too giddy & had to give up.\n","410":" There was a procession to St Michael’s. All the soldiers & Council attended the Intercession Service. I intended going, but got up too late. After Dinner Ern & I paid a visit to Father’s Grave. It is well looked after. There are quite a lot of new Graves near, that were not there when I was here last May. All the Hotels were closed all day..\n","411":" Went visiting. Saw Mrs Hambleton at the Brewery Stable, who enquired after France, & said that my wife must be a \"lovely person\". Fancy calling B.E. a person\n","412":" Train for London. Ruth came with me to Station. Arrived London about 8.30. Slept at War Chest Club. Good clean Bed for 1\/-.\n","413":" Furlough ended. Boarded Train at Paddington at 12.20 & came away to Sutton Veny on the famous Salisbury Plain.\n\n"}}
