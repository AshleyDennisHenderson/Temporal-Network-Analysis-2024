Spent","60":" days at Durban the first day unfortunately as Ship's Orderly Officer\ns\n. Practically everything done by Kaffirs & coolies. Zulus are Rickshaw men very powerful and well built. Native police very big & have a high opinion of themselves. Seem very effective, the Zulus & other natives seem afraid of them.Zulus men got great harvest from the Australians. Men scrambled considerable money among kaffirs- throwing water upon themwhile in a bunch on the ground.\n\n \n\nTram-carselectric on same system as Sydney but all single cars & \ndouble deckers\n. All soldiers travelled free upon invitation of Municipal Council which also provided free admission to Zoo, Baths Botanic Gardens.Municipal control of trains & all abovementioned. Beach Parade very fine with Children's paddling bains& large opensea baths barred in. Durban notorious for sharks. (water)\n\nDurban people have given Germans a bad time, having burned down practically\n\n\n\nevery German shop on an organised system even the marines called out to protect the property assisting in its destruction. Natal very loyal, but Durbanites report great disloyalty among the Dutch all over the Union.\n\nY.M.C.A. & Methodists especially good to our men, the YMCAproviding eg. 2 eggs, bread, butter & tea for 4d & the Methodists providing free tea & cake etc.\n\nWe had 3 route marches & were enthusiastically welcomed. Many ladies\n\n\n\nthrew hundreds of oranges & nachis(mandarins) onto the boat both on our drawing in & pulling out. Ostrich feathers cheap. I bought 3 for Jess for £1 & a boa for 25\/-. Registered them home.\n\nI visited Zoo by rickshaw with Petteson, paid 5\/- Dined at Durban Club - very fine club - as guest of local commandant - Colonel Wylie - with two other local colonels Col.

Singing rather poor & acoustic qualities of the Town Hall bad.-\n\nVisited Umbilo, Bentley's sister - Mrs. Eaton - lives at Durban. Natives in every trade except plastering which Australian workmen run & will not instruct natives in\n\nTram-Parcel delivery a good idea. Buy a penny ticket & place on parcel & pay another 1d on Delivery at second parcel depot, ie a shop where arrangements have been made to reserve such parcelry.\n\nAnother good idea new to Sydney - Children's paddling basins, also enclosure for surfing safe from sharks. \nAnother\n - Penny in the slot machines for stamps.\n\n10pm\n","61":" Just dropped anchor in Table Bay off Capetown\n\nEntry","62":"\n\nAfter a very calm & pleasant trip arrived at Capetown at 9pm on","63":"Drew into wharf next morn - no welcome at all from the townspeople.
