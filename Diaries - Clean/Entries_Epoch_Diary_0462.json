A few shots were fired across the town.\n\nThey regard the \"Flamands\" with very little love - calling them Germans rather than Belgians. \"A \nWalloon\n Flamand comes with a prayer book in one hand and a knife in the other\" said a madame to me.\n\nI have a very comfortable clean bed and have enjoyed a long conversation with M.

It rained for most of the journey. The 14th & 15th Bns stayed at Phillipville . Along the track were a great many German motor lorries & transport gear. Here we have comfortable billets but the men are somewhat cramped for space\n\n- quite different to our very large billets at Sains. There is Electric Light everywhere, quite free apparently, as no house has a meter. The men have it in their billets. I rode on horse ambulance today on account of my sore face. I have a comfortable clean room with clean sheets - the third time in my three nights in Belgium. The people are very courteous & desirous of doing all they can for us. Madame here has 2 children of her own and two nieces from Flanders who are living with her to learn French. She is a \nWalloon\n Flamand but dislikes the \nWalloons\n Flamands of Flanders - from Ghent, Bruges, Ypres - and said the people here were afraid of the \nWalloons\n Flamands working in the district. The only union between the two races in Belgium is the one of Religion\n\n\n\nboth races being R.C.\n\n17\nRemained in bed until 11am as my face is still ugly & sore. Asked Lt McRae to look after the Company's Xmas Dinner arrangements.\n\nThe Belgians in the three places I have been in tell me that they were better treated than the French or English by the Germans, that the Germans hated the English above all other nations, & that they had repeatedly spoken of the wonderful colonial troops of England. At Sivry they paid the Belgian prisoners and fed them but starved the French & English.
