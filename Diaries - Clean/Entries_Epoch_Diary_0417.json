1916\n\nNew Years day, played cards all day & won about 10\/-. Stayed at home all day, had a very quiet time.\n\nSunday \n\nHad a very quiet day, lay about & read & went for a walk in the afternoon.\n\nMonday 3 January, 1916\n\nWent out to Pieta in the afternoon & had a good time. Left early & went to the Olympia Club & met a Marine Corporal named Baseby. We had a good few drinks & a game of billiards. After that they asked me to stay out of camp overnight so we went across the grand harbour in a dicer but I could not get a bed so I had to make my way back to camp, about 6 miles & across two harbours. I eventually arrived home safely at about 12.30.\n\nTuesday 4 January 1916\n\nLeft All Saints camp at 11.30 a.m. to embark for Alexandria. Embarked on H.T. \"Bornu\" at 3.30 p.m. She is rather an old boat & looks as if she will roll a lot.\n\nWe expect to sail early in the morning.\n\nWednesday 5 January, 1916\n\nSailed at 6.30.\n\nThe \"Bornu\" is a bad sea ship & had made a lot of the boys sick. I am all right so far.\n\nWas on Night Guard, on guard from 8 to 10.30 p.m. & from 2.30 a.m. to 4.30. So I did not get much sleep.\n\nThe weather is very calm.\n\n","1":"\n\nFeeling a bit tired. The weather is beginning to get windy with a promise of rain.\n\nRain came on late in the afternoon & the sea got up a good deal. It is a pitch dark night & the boat is rolling horribly. We have as escort a little trawler which carries two light guns. She is rolling all over the place & shipping a lot of water. We have to have our lifebelts with us all the time & are all told off to certain boats in case of being torpedoed. I am in No 13 mess & 13 boat so according to anyone of a superstitious nature I don't stand much chance of pulling through if anything happens.\n","2":"\n\nThe wind & rain continues, the sea is getting very rough & it is nearly impossible to stand on deck. Most of the chaps are seasick, I am not feeling too happy myself but I am not at all ill.\n\nIt is becoming a juggling trick to eat your meals nowadays, you dare not take your hand off your plate for a moment & have to eat with the other.\n\nIt has been raining on & off all the morning but after dinner the wind went down & the sun showed up a bit though the sea is still rough.\n","3":"\n\nThe sea is calming down a great deal & things are almost normal again. Our escort, the little trawler is having engine trouble & this is keeping us back.\n\nWe play a lot of bridge it is about the only way of putting in the time.\n","4":"\n\nThe weather was dirty early in the morning but during the afternoon it has been lovely, even the birds, we have some canaries on board seem happy & all singing away.\n\nThe air is warm & the sea is a lovely blue, it is a delight to be on it even if you are in an old tub of a transport.\n\nWe came in sight of land towards evening but did not go into harbour.\n","5":"\n\nWe were cruising around all night & ran into Alexandria at about 9.30 a.m.\n\nLay in the harbour all day, we are very anxious to get ashore which we won't do till tomorrow, we are lying near the entrance to the harbour & have some fine scenery to look at.\n","6":"\n\nWere towed up the harbour to 28 wharf, the Tommies got off in the morning but we had to wait till afternoon.\n\nWere taken to \"A\" Camp Gabbari at Alexandria, our officers left us standing & went off. We had neither food nor bedding, we managed to get something to eat off some kind hearted Tommies & had to put on as many pieces of extra clothing as we could to bunk amongst some horse fodder in the Veterinary store. We were pretty cold & uncomfortable.\n","7":"\n\nStill at a loose end nobody loves us & nobody wants us. The camp adjutant has turned out a brick & is trying to get us bedding & money. We got 8\/- each &our bedding so we are all right. No leave has been given but we have taken a look round Alex, we have no time to do the thing thoughly but from what I can see it is a much finer place than Cairo though not as large.\n\nWe got unspecified orders to be ready to move off at 11 p.m., most of our boys were the worse for the 8\/- but we got away all right, 130 of us with no one in charge & are now on our way to Cairo. Hooray, I will soon be back with the boys.\n\nThursday 13 January, 1916\n\nArrived safely at Tel-El-Kebir at 8.30 a.m. Mac was O.K. I went straight on duty. It is great to be back at it once more, 5 brigades are here with Artillery & Light horse.\n\nReceived 6 parcels, had more than I knew what to do with but you may be sure that nothing was wasted.\n\nWent & saw Bob Dryden, he is well.\n\nBest of all I received 25 letters, I had a gay old time reading them.\n\nThe Dervish trenches are only 5 minutes walk from the camp where the battle of Tel-El-Kebir was fought in the Egyptian War of 1882.\n\nFriday 14 January, 1916\n\nGot some more letters today, I am in luck. The dainties out of the parcels are going fast & are highly appreciated.\n\nWe do our work on the desert wich is much harder than that round Cairo & all covered with stones.\n\nThe country here is very flat looking away towards the canal & all hummocky towards the desert. We get it cold here in the morning but it is lovely & warm later on.\n\nSaturday 15 January, 1916\n\nBig things doing. Brigade inspection in the morning, by the afternoon all the troops were inspected by Sir Archibald Murray. He was very pleased with our turnout.\n\nSunday 16 January, 1916\n\nChurch parade in the morning. Went to see Frank Isaac & the boys after dinner.\n\nMonday 17 January, 1916\n\nPassed standard tests in Machine Gun school.\n\nTuesday 18 January, 1916\n\nRaining on & off, going on to more advanced work with the guns.\n\nWednesday 19 January, 1916\n\nDrilled in the morning & had a half holiday in the afternoon. Young Gribble came up to see me & we both went to see Mr Wright but he was busy so we didn't bother.\n\nThursday 20 January, 1916\n\nHave been out at the range all day, fell in at 7.15 & got home about 7 p.m. We had to march 3 miles there & back, I came back half way on a limber as I have been crook lately.\n\nFriday 21 January, 1916\n\nPretty tired after yesterdays work nothing much doing, fooling round signalling & cutting out time.\n\nSaturday 22 January, 1916\n\nVery slack day, fooled round all the time. We heard that we are leaving here tomorrow but do not know how true it is.\n\nSunday 23 January, 1916\n\nMess orderly today.\n\nAll the G'burn boys had their photos taken with Major Fitzgerald.\n\nGot orders to move. Struck tents at 4.30 p.m., lay in our overcoats till 12.45, moved off 1.20 a.m. went by train to Ismailia. Marched from there to Ferry Post about 4 miles.\n\nOur Pack was 250 rounds of ammunition, 2 blankets & waterproof sheet & all spare clothes etc something like 120 lbs.\n\nMonday 24 January, 1916\n\nWe marched on to our camping ground dead beat & fell down where we stood. About an hour later the tents came so we pitched tents & had some breakfast. After that I payed a visit to the canteen & bought a few eatables.\n\nWent to bed at about 6.30.\n\nTuesday 25 January, 1916\n\nWent down to the canteen for bread, nothing doing so I went into Ismailia, had a very fine time, arrived home at about 4.30 p.m. with 3 loaves of bread.\n\nWednesday 26 January, 1916\n\nI have struck some tough goes out here, but today has been about as bad as any. The only thing in its favour was that it was sharp & short. It was a 6 hour nightmare.\n\nWe left Ferry post at about 9 a.m. & struck out in the desert towards the trenches with a full pack & from then it became a ceaseless struggle through the sand & rain till 4 p.m. I was at my last gasp several times but I managed to keep up with the column, through the ankle deep sand & ended dead beat like every one else. We are now camped in the sand with the prospect of stopping there till after the Turks have made their dash.\n\nThursday 27 January, 1916\n\nOur position is in Pinchgut Hollow, in the 2nd line of defence. There are 14 men in our tent.\n\nIt is wet & miserable, only half the Battalion is here the remainder are at Tel-El-Kebir.\n\nFriday 28 January, 1916\n\nWe have had to live on bully beef, biscuits & cheese all the time & very little of that. I wrote a letter to the mater telling her all about our getting here but it was returned by censor who will not let us say anything about being this side of the canal.\n\nA chap from the A.M.C. went into Ismalia with sick & we have given him some cash to bring us back something to eat & some cigarettes.\n\nThe bad tucker is bringing on my old complaint again.\n\nSaturday 29 January, 1916\n\nAm crook with Dysentery.\n\nOur extra tucker came today so everybody is happy.\n\nSome of the chaps say you are better off in gaol as you do get bread there & they are not far out; it is worse here than in the Peninsula both for water & food.\n\nSunday 30 January, 1916\n\nChurch parade in the morning.\n\nPlayed the Signallers football & beat them 9 to nil. Too much of a crowd in the tent so I slept outside.\n\nFinished all our extra tucker, are waiting for the next man to go into civilisation. Feeling O.K. again.\n\nMonday 31 January, 1916\n\nAm tent orderly today, have had some very interesting work on the guns, doing \"tactical handling\" in the field; taking up positions without being seen.\n\nWe are all a bit stiff after the football yesterday.\n\nTuesday 1 February, 1916\n\nFeeling better today.\n\nIt gets very monotomous in this hole. We have to drill just for appearances sake & we are all heartly sick of it as the tucker is very scarce & extremely rough.\n\nStew & biscuits being about the most apertising dish we have served up to us & when there is not a sign of vegetable in the stew & the biscuits refuse to submit to mastrication till they have been thoroughly soaked you may guess it is no first class hotel out this way.\n\nWednesday 2 February, 1916\n\nDrill in the morning, half holiday in the afternoon, we played a draw at football with the signallers. Mac & I were not playing. Mac had a crook leg & a bad eye & I was too shaky from Dysentery.\n\nOur mail arrived today. I got about 8 letters, one batch being mail that has been following me round for some time.\n\nThursday 3 February, 1916\n\nThe two companies, C & D, that were left at Tel-El-Kebir arrived here today.\n\nThey had the same march as we had & were pretty tired & many had left their blankets behind.\n\nFriday 4 February, 1916\n\nAm off duty today.\n\nThere was a bit of a mutiny in C. Company today, the men refused to put on their packs to go out on parade, it ended up by the men going out as they were ordered with 13 left behind in the guard tent.\n\nSaturday 5 February, 1916\n\nWet day.\n\nTucker no good. Could not even get a biscuit to eat, have never been so short since I joined the army.\n\n4th Reinforcements arrived today. Holloway came with them.\n\n\n\nSunday 6 February, 1916\n\nTucker getting very scarce. 1\/4th tins of jam & 1\/6th of a tin of bully per man with biscuits & about¼ lb of meat for one day.\n\nAn aeroplane flew over the camp this morning. She was a big British machine & was flying very low, evidently scouting for Turks.\n\nMonday 7 February, 1916\n\nSadness in the tucker line. Dinner 1½ biscuits each, 1 tin of jam between 11 men & 1 pannican of tea. (Indigestion is very scarce in this camp.)\n\nAnother aeroplane came over today & scouted round for about half & hour.\n\nThe railway is right up to us now & timber & matting is beginning to come in for the trenches.\n\nWe had our tea tonight listening to the strains of music produced by the band. We would rather have them put a little more sugar in the tea or make it an extra tin of jam per day if they are trying to make our meals more pleasant; music is so unsatisfactory as an item of your diet.\n\nTuesday 8 February, 1916\n\nWarm day, was tent orderly. Stayed in in the morning. Went out in the afternoon & hurt my back lifting the gun & tripod.\n\nWednesday 9 February, 1916\n\nThe day is cold, wet & miserable & so am I. I am out of humour with everything & everyone, it is because I am feeling so crook but I suppose it will all come right in the end.\n\nThursday 10 February, 1916\n\nThings are a bit brighter today. I am feeling a bit better. We got ½ loaf of bread per man.\n\nToday is the first day that the heat has had a sting in it. We all had our coats off on the afternoon parade.\n\nThe Companies have put on an extra spurt with the trench digging & the aeroplanes are up every day. We hear all sorts of rumours of where the Turks are, varying from 7000 yds to forty miles but none are to be relied upon.\n\nFriday 11 February, 1916\n\nFelt very off in the morning but bucked up in the afternoon.\n\nOur tucker was of the starvation order again today, tea & dry bread for dinner & no spuds in the stew for breakfast.\n\nIt has been a beautiful clear day today, from our drilling ground at the trenches we could look over some 10 miles of sand hillocks & desert bush to the dark purple ribbon of the canal, it is most distinct, you can clearly see where it widens out at the Bitter Lakes with the town of Ismailia there still further in the distance. At present there is a cargo steamer lying at Ferry Post while the 4 funnels & tapering masts of a large cruiser peep shyly over the smooth summit of a far distant sand dune while the mutter of her guns floats fitfully to our ears on the heavy desert air. Further to the South on the Suez side the land rises to the nearest approach we can see to a purple line of hills. Such is our piece of desert scenery from pinchgut.\n\nSaturday 12 February, 1916\n\nPay day, drew £3. It has been a hot day with wind.\n","8":"\n\nGot fed up with camp so decided to walk to Ismailia to get a good feed. I covered 26 miles, 2\/3 of which was desert, in 11 hours (some going).\n\nLeft camp 12 midday arrived at Ismailia about 3.30, left for home about 7 p.m. arrivedat 11 p.m.\n\nIn town I met Harry Glover who is a 1st Lieut in the 2nd division artillery. I also met Bombadier Baseby & his friend Ives from the Egmont (for our last meeting see Monday Jan 3rd '16). We had a good yarn & something to eat in lieu of a drink, we were very pleased to see each other again & he invited me on board Egmont.\n\nThe walk I did today is the stiffest I have ever tackled & I feel quite proud of myself. I also met -- Robinson, a friend of Ken Hamiltons. It is a small world.\n\n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nPretty tired today, was tent orderly.\n\nThe tucker is a bit off, no water today or yesterday either so we are pretty dry.\n\nI only got 3 letters this mail so I am feeling rather glum but you have to grin & bear it.\n\nTuesday 15 February, 1916\n\nWet day, the first for about a week. It was not enough to keep us off parade so we stripped the gun in the tent.\n\nDinner was painful today, no tea & no water. Dry bread & jam isn't a sumptuous repast whichever way you look at it, but its all in the game & you're got to keep smiling.\n\nWednesday 16 February, 1916\n\nIt rained a little in the afternoon but it didn't matter as it was our half holiday.\n\nWe had some rather good tucker today, bacon for dinner also a ration of cheese & raisons.\n\nWe are very expectant today. We have heard that that a big mail is due tomorrow & that a lot of stores we ordered from the canteen is coming in the morning. To cap it all we have been told that leave for 48 hours to 3% \nleave\n of the men is being granted soon so we are quite excted.\n\nBob Harris & Andy Luke went to hospital with mumps.\n\nOur canteen stuff arrived tonight. Had a feed on the strength of it.\n\nThursday 17 February, 1916\n\nWent up to see the Doc about a bad cold.\n\nBob Harris\n&\n\nWas disappointed as to the mail, three letters only, I expected a lot more.\n\nFriday 18 February, 1916\n\nHad two trips over to the right half of the 20th Batt for another gun & tripod, we saw some fine desert scenery round Australia Hill.\n\nIn the evening we moved camp & I was put in a different tent to Mac & Bernie, it feels strange being away from them.\n\nTwo of our chaps, \"Sis\" Ellis & Bingham had a fight, Bingham won. It is the first fight we have had in the M.G.S. .\n\nSaturday 19 February, 1916\n\nAm not sure whether I am sickening for the mumps or not.\n\nThis afternoon we were inspected by Genl. Legge who said there was a chance of us going to France. He read us a lecture on discipline which I hope does some good as we are very lax in that respect.\n\nSunday 20 February, 1916\n\nHad the strangest church parade I have ever taken part in. It was in the midst of wind & rain. We sang the first hymn & then had to retire in a hurry because of the rain. We emerged however a few minutes later clad in our great coats & went on from the general confession.\n\nAll our services are held in the open air with the regiment drawn up in hollow square. The Colonel & adjutant sit in the centre with the officers in front in review order.\n\nMonday 21 February, 1916\n\nWe have been living on the fat of the land for the last six days, what with our canteen stuff & the comfort fund we have had a high old time but all our good things have gone now, I finished my last tin of fish today.\n\nLieut Hamilton came back to the section today, he is fatter than ever.\n\nWas mess orderly today.\n\nTuesday 22 February, 1916\n\n\"Hammy\" lead off well by making us carry all our equipment on all parades, needless to say we were all duly pleased. The only way for him to keep our pleasure within reasonable bounds is by leaving us alone for a while.\n\nWednesday 23 February, 1916\n\nStarted digging gun pits. We are digging No 1 Position it is on the left of \"B\" Company's trenches. There are four of us & the Sergeant. We have a mile walk from the camp before we start work - full kit - & a walk of the same distance back. An engineer is in charge of the job.\n\nWe had our half holiday & we needed it, it is hard work shovelling sand.\n\nThursday 24 February, 1916\n\nAt it again this morning. We are hard at it, shovelling sand and filling sand bags. The sun is very warm, we strip to the waist for the sake of more freedom.\n\nSand work is a great trial on the temper. You work hard for an hour & throw out a huge heap of sand only to have it all tumble in again, half burying you. It gives you free play for pure Australian language. All the same we are making good headway.\n\nGot a parcel from the mater & it was most welcome. I was feeling a bit down on it & it cheered me up.\n\nFriday 25 February, 1916\n\nWe put in the finishing touches on our pit but we still have about 20 yards of communication trench to do & 2 dugouts to put in.\n\nWe are getting used to the walking back & forward to the job also to the hard work & my back is beginning to show less signs of complaining than at first.\n\nI managed to get a pair of sox & a balaclava cap from the comforts fund.\n\nSaturday 26 February, 1916\n\nWe haven't been killing ourselves today. We are further advanced than any of the other pits so are taking it easy.\n\nWe are being well fed lately & have plenty of water. We have nooccassion to grumble & yet we do. It is a soldiers privelige. Personally I don't mind it out here now, only that I am anxious to get home again & I don't suppose I shall be decently happy till I get there.\n\nSunday 27 February, 1916\n\nHad to work in the morning. No church parade today. We had a concert in the afternoon. The men came back from the Zeitoun Machine Gun School at dinner time all except 1 man got instructors ticket.\n\nMonday 28 February, 1916\n\nWe are to have the machine guns of the Brigade, are going to be formed into one company. Lewis guns will take the place of the maxims in the Battalions. Tub and I have taken on the job of scouts. We will be on Headquarters staff & big kits. This change takes place from the 1st March.\n\nTuesday 29 February, 1916\n\nPay day (£2).\n\nWe finished off our Gun pit alltogether this morning & went out on another job in the afternoon.\n\nI am feeling very tired. All the hard work is beginning to tell. Thank goodness today is the last time we will be digging.\n\nWe are moving over to brigade Headquarters tomorrow.\n\nWednesday 1 March, 1916\n\nWorked in the morning. We got all ready to move over to Brigade headquarters but had them cancelled at the last moment & we had to repack our gear. The reason that we could not go was that we could not leave the Battalion without guns & had to wait till the new Lewis guns arrived which will be in about a weeks time.\n\nThursday 2 March, 1916\n\nThe sand is everywhere as the wind has sprung up, we were out digging in the morning & were almost smothered. In the afternoon it became so bad that we couldn't be taken out.\n\nThe sand flies about just like rain, cutting our face & hands not to mention filling our eyes & ears.\n\nGambling is going on hot & strong 50 piastre notes (£ - 10\/-) floating about all over the place. All is fine fun. I am going easy myself as I have leave to go to Cairo tomorrow & do not intend to lose that over a game of cards.\n\nFriday 3 March, 1916\n\nGot leave to go to Cairo. We have done no work today owing to the dust storms so the boys have been playing cards all day. I didn't as I want my cash to go to town.\n\nSaturday 4 March, 1916\n\nNow I must say goodbye to my little diary, the recorder of my pleasures & hardships & the times of peace & war through which it has been my lot to pass since leaving my civilian life for the sterner one of a soldier.\n\nI am sending it on a long journey which I hope to make myself ere long but if perchance I am long in coming this little book will tell in brief what my fortunes have been in these distant lands to which the call of the Flag has led me.\n\nGod grant us a speedy victory & a safe return with honour.\n\nL.K.

We left Lemnos at 7.15 p.m.First sighted lights off Cape Helles 11.15, arrived at Gaba Tepe 12.30. Action was in progress which resulted in the occupation by Australians of a hill. Marched with full equipment & gunsto Reserve Gully. Visited early in morning the N.Z. Battery & had some shots at the Turks from advanced shelters.\n\nHave found out that the hill was not occupied last night as supposed.\n","168":"\n\nWarships fired a few rounds in the morning, in afternoon a heavy attackwas made on enemys trenches in the direction of hill 971 covered by the guns of the fleet & land batteries. The Turkishguns were hopelessly out classed & duly made very feeble reply. The shooting of the British was exquisite. They turned about 4 square miles into a veritable inferno using luddite & shrapnel. At times the dust & debris was so great as to resemble a fierce dust storm. We watched the fun from the high cliffs near Mt Camel in spite of the number of spent bullets that came our way, which were calmly ignored by the boys. We are advancing now to man the reserve trenches, it will be our first taste of real fire.\n\nWe slept behind the line of trenches. We were in a bad position, spent & stray bullets fell amongst us while we slept & we lost several men.\n\nThis bombardment was when the English Yeomanry advanced under shrapnel to Chocolate Hill.\n","169":"\n\n18th Battn badly cut up by the M.G. while charging, several companies almost annihilated. We moved into the reserve trenches & had to pass over 400 yards exposed to shrapnel. The enemy had the range down inch & inflicted about 20 casualties on us.\n\nThe trenches so far are very poor, it is just as well there are no snipers about or we would lose heavily, as it is we have lost about 12 by stray bullets. I was sent twice for water & had to pass right in the track of stray bullets fired on the trenches on our right.\n\nOur men are being very roughly handled so are the N.Z. They & the Indians are easily the best regiments out here. They are obeying the officers very well.\n\nWe have many more guns than the Turks but they are well concealed & the country is so broken that it is almost impossible to locate them. We have only lost 1 officer so far. I don't mind this work a bit. The bullets are not so bad.\n\nCapt Fitzpatrick killed in action.\n","170":"\n\nHave been talking to some Ghurkas. We cooked our breakfast in the trenches, water is scarce but we have been well supplied with food so far.\n\nWe have been busy improving our trenches all day. A few stray shots have come our way but no one has been hurt, we have had plenty of food & water.\n\nWe are still 700 yards behind the firing line. We have had several casualties. The enemy have sent a few shrapnel shells against our trenches, severly wounding one man.\n\nThe Gurrkas made a slight advance during the night and\nthe stray bullets have been very bad. We are becoming expert cooks, with the limited utensils at our disposal.\n\n\n","171":"\n\nTrench routine, carrying water, going on fatigues, etc.\n\nWas in charge of a guard of three last night. The Ghurkas attached & made a slight advance. Slept in a dugout part of the night & a trench the rest. Stray bullets kept giving you a cold feeling down the small of the back, as we are right behind the fire trench & as most of the bullets go high in the night our trench gets a rough time after dark.\n","172":"\n\nWas sent to the base for overcoats about 6 miles altogether. We were sniped at more than was comfortable. I carried the coats on the side nearest the enemy, \"just in case\". In the afternoon I had to dig a gun position & deepen a trench.\n\nOur dinner consisted of boiled rice, biscuits, jam, bovril & bully beef, with tea. I was cook for Mac & I.\n\nSlept out in the open all night, was glad of my overcoat. It is considered bad form to run here or to duck - for anything except shrapnel, anything is permissable for that. In fact when we had to go out in the open under shrapnel one chap dropped what he was carrying & beat it for his life. The next day, the general came along & frightened seven years growth out of him. Told him he could have him shot for it, but he said he'd do it again under similar circumstances.\n","173":"\n\nHave had a hot time with shrapnelin the morning. I went to the beach for a swim in the morning, was shelled there & all the afternoon until dark they peppered our trenches with them we had surprisingly few casualties. At 7.30 we had to change our position. 14 of us were separated from the rest & had to sleep out amongst the stray bullets. It is pretty nerveracking for bullets to snick into the ground within a few feet of you, coming apparently from nowhere. We have had a bad time so far, our battallion has lost about 50 men & have not had a chance to fire a shot.\n\nMoving with the machine guns is no joke, all gear & ammunition is carried by hand. I often wonder if they made a mistake in my papers & think I signed on as a carthorse.\n","174":"\n\nWe are holding \"Courtneys Post\" near the extreme right of the Australian position. There are Turkish trenches on every side of us. It makes you a bit shaky for a while to hear bullets thudding into the sandbags a couple of feet from your head or shells shrieking over the hill into Popes Post 200 yards away.\n\nThe Indians out here are very cool customers. It isgreat see them plodding along with the mules taking no more notice of the bullets than if they were flies.\n\nThis place is a regular network of trenches, you could easily lose yourself in them. They are 8 feet deep in the front line & they need to be for they are being fired into day & night.\n\nHad a swim at Hell Spit this afternoon. Expected to be shelled any minute but was determined to have a dip.\n","175":"\n\nShould have been a day of rest but it has been the greatest battering we have had since I have been here. We blew upa Turkish sap a few yards away from our gun pit, we just got out in time. The charge exploded as we came out of the tunnel. Water is the great problem here. We have to carry all we drink for over a mile.\n\nI had Les Payhem over for a yarn today, I was very glad to see him.\n\nShells have been crashing into our position all day. There are a couple of guns we can't locate & they are a veritable thorn in our side, you hear thewhizz bang of shrapnel at the most unexpected times & places. You never know when one will come close enough to put you out of action.\n\nGreat engineering skill has been used in making the valley as safe as possible. There must be 5 miles of saps 6 ft deep & 4 ft wide dug by the infantry at night.\n\nFriday 27th August, 1915\n\nStill lost, I had to go & forage for rations for 14 men. I got 2 loaves of bread, a big lump of bacon, two tins of jam & some tea & sugar & as we have finished them offI feel much more cheerful.\n\nWe found a N.Zlander who happened to be going to the same place as us so he offered to guide us. After tremendous labour we got our guns to their position which was at Popes Post only 20 yards from the\nGerman\nTurkish trenches. We have to do a permanent guard3 hours on & 6 hours off.\n\nWe get well fed here & have good facilities for cooking. We even had some jam & cheese, both on the same piece of bread,\n\nSnipers are bad here. Won't be surprised to get a bullet in the head sometimes when I am going round a corner. There is a telephone here. Our gun is in an underground dugout. There is a dead Turks leg sticking out of the ground 5 feet from my face, not too pleasant.\n","176":"\n\n6 men were sent out to get our kit bags which we had to discard last Monday. Mac & I had a swim. Itspleasures were somewhat marred by a few shells from \"Beachy Bill\".\n\nOur shifts have been changed. Each man does 2 hrs on & 6 off. We go on at night from 6 to 8 & then from 2 to 4. At 4 o'clock all men have to stand to arms till 5, we can then have a couple of hours sleep till 7 so it is no picnic here.\n\nThe Turks are sending the shells closer to our camp every day. This afternoon one lobbed only 60 yards away. We are expecting one through the roof next. We are badly off for news, have not had a letter for over a fortnight.\n\nI hope to have a shave tomorrow, first for a fortnight. I look a regular hero with all that growth on.\n\nSome Italian officers have been floating about here & there is a rumour that they are landing 30,000 men, lets hope so as it will end this all the quicker.\n","177":"\n\nA most strenuous day. Carried water in the morning, sent to base for packs at 2.15 p.m. arrived back 7.15 on guard from 8 to 10 & 2 to 4. I had to stand to arms at 4 a.m.\n\nHeavy firing broke out against our trenches at 8.30 & lasted till 9 p.m. This was evidently a blind to hide operations in the centre where a furious fire was heard. We have not heard what happened but presume it was an attack by the Turks. The demonstration against our trenches took the form of a heavy shower of bombs. Both sides used flares as it was a very dark night. We spent a very tense half hour, expecting to have to bring the gun into action at any minute but things died down without the enemy taking the offensive.\n\nMet Nev Hodgens, have to see him tomorrow afternoon.\n\nA lot of our chaps are crook none serious but those who are well have a lot of extra work to do.\n","178":"\n\nNothing much doing. Camp routine.\n\nWhile on watch from 4 to 6 p.m. I witnessed a lively little bomb throwing match between our chaps & the Turks at Quinns Post. Our chaps won on points but I don't think much damage was done on either side.\n\n\n","179":"\n","180":" & 18th Batts came to Monash Gully to relieve some of the Regiments who have been here for a long time.\n\nTurkish aeroplane flew over our trenches reconnoitering in the evening.\n\nThe enemy kept up a heavy rifle & shell fire all night knocking our parapet about in places.\n\nWrote to Mater & Mignonette.\n","181":"\n\nHave been crook today.\n\nExpected an attack at night. We have no supports at all & only 4 men to each post in the firing line, we would have had a bad time if they had given it a fly. As it was they opened up an exceptionally heavy rifle & machine gun fire which had no effect except making us a bit more watchful.\n\nSaturday 2 September, 1915\n\nStill off duty, for talk of a Turkish attack. 18th Batt came up as reserves, nothing eventuated.\n\nHave heard that Capt Fitzpatrick is not dead but is suffering from nervous breakdown. Bob Dryden is safe, have been having a yarn to him, he has had a pretty exciting time.\n","182":"\n\nOne man killed in trenches. It is now getting very cold at night. Aforetaste of what we may expect later on.\n\nThe usual bombardment by the enemy. We aregetting quite used to this now & take no notice.\n\nAm well again today.\n\nRoast meat for dinner a rare treat, makes you think you are back at home.\n","183":"\n\nHave been taking things as easily as possible.\n\nMade pancakes for all the boys today which were duly appreciated.\n\nAre beginning to feel quite old soldiers now & take bombardments & stray bullets very calmly indeed.\n","184":"\n\nReceived letters from home & papers.\n\nLetters from Gibby, Mrs Parish (2), Jessie Chilsholm, Ollie Turner, Phyllis Floden, & Mater & Ida.\n\nWent down & had a yarn to Bob Dryden. Cheered his heart by giving Tobacco, Matches & Cigarette Papers. His battalion are having a rest down Monash Gully.\n\nThe 24th Batt arrived last night as support to the","185":"who are so weak in numbers that no man has a chance of being out of the firing line day or night\n","186":"\n\nHave made a seperate dugout for ourselves. Mac, I & Bernie Norris. Mac is pretty crook in the stomach but seems to be improvong. The 21st Batt relieved the 24th. They are very raw men & allowed a Turk to get into our trenches early in the Morning.\n\n21st Batt were torpedoed outside Lemnos & lost the Brigadier & about 40 men.\n\nThursday 9 September, 1915\n\nWrote to Mother, Ada & Gibby.\n\nMac has been crook all day but thinks he is getting better.\n\nWent down for water & lay about the rest of the day in our dugout, which is a regular little home.\n\nThe Turkish guns have been very quiet lately. I think they must have been located. Only one of them has fired at all during the last few days.\n","187":"\n\nNamed our dugout. It has the distinction of being the first place on \"Courtneys\" to have a name. It's monica is \"Kangarooma\"\n\nTwo men of the 8th collected last night. It was their last watch before going away for a rest, a case of \"stiff knees\".\n\nHave been doing a bit of cooking today. I got hold of a tin of milk. Breakfast, bread & milk, Dinner, boiled rice & tea rissoles. Quite an elaborate diet for here.\n\nA bomb burst just outside our gun pit last night & a piece came through the opening passing between myself & the chap who was on with me. You don't seem to be safe here anywhere lately.\n","188":"\n\nWatches changed, have to do 18 hours on & 18 hours off.\n\nHeavy firing during night. It is reported that Hill 971 & the railway have been captured. If that is so we may safely anticipate an early move from here.\n\nScored a tin of concentrated cream & made some rice & milk which was very acceptable, am looking forward to a repitition if I can get good with the Quartermaster Sgt who has a couple of cases.\n\nIt continues cold, especially at night. The artillery on both sides was very active during the afternoon, several shells landed on Courtneys.\n\nWe find our dugout a great blessing you get a bit of peace & quietness.\n\nOne of our men, Gibson, has been sent to Lemnos suffering from Dysentry. This is the first man we have lost.\n","189":"\n\nHad a shave, made a great find in the shape of a pair of socks, I only had those I stood up in before.\n\nScored another tin of milk & had some more rice & milk. Mac had some & reckoned it was all right.\n\nThe weather is cold & dull, would not be surprised to see some rain.\n\nMac had a \"chat\" hunt & got 13, he expects to have a comfortable nights sleep tonight.\n\nVery light shower of rain during the night. Heavy bombardment by the fleet on the right.\n\nWrote to Mrs Ray, Mr Maguire & Mr Chauvel.\n","190":"\n\nAnother man sent to Lemnos, Pte Simpson.\n\nA very hard day, two trips to the beach, shelled both times, the second time the shells were going all round me but most of them went in the water & failed to explode. I had only been back from my second trip & hour & a half before going into the gun pit all night.\n\nMet Paddy Matthews & Les Payton down on the beach & had a yarn to them.\n\nWater has been very short lately for some reason or other & what we do get is very salty.\n\nIt was very cold on watch on the gun during the night but I managed to get a fair amount of sleep so do not feel too bad this morning.\n\nThe artillery on both sides has been very lively. Pte Halfford, one of our men got a slight graze from a bullet on the head, the first man we have had touched.\n\n\n","191":"\n\nVery dull & cold. Very lively artillery duel, our guns firing about 6 times to the Turks one. We got a burst of shrapnel on our hill from goodness knows where as the Turks can never get a shell there, it must have been a badly timed shell from our own guns.\n\nHave had a long guard to do, have been on duty 4 out of 18 hours it is too much as we have to go on fatigue work, carrying water when we come off.\n\nWe are getting all this extra work because so many men are sick.\n","192":"\n\nSlight shower of rain during the night made everything sloppy & uncomfortable.Had to go off sick today just a touch of dysentery, I hope to be well again tomorrow.\n\nThey are putting a fourth man in our happy home, it will be a bit crowded.\n\nHave been put on a rice diet. Wrote home & to Jessie Chisholm, Tom, Mrs Parish & Phyllis today.\n\nHave been pretty crook & off duty, had a good nights sleep.\n","193":"\n\nLetters from home. Mater, Dot & a very nice one from Beryl.\n\nAm right once more & will go on duty next watch. The watches have been changed from 18 to 24 hrs.\n\nThe chaps in the big shed started to mend the roof & had half of it off when the rain came on & gave them a bad time of it.Had a sharp shower which however did not last long.\n\nThe Turks turned their attention to our post last night, one shell which failed to explode landed very close to our quarters. About a dozen others landed on the crest of the hill.Stray bullets occasionally fall about our humpy, one came very close during the night & made us feel a bit uncomfortable.\n","194":"\n\nOn duty again.Very hard work carrying sandbags up the hill & finishing the mending of the roof of the big shed. Finished that & am building a shelter for the cook.\n\nScored one egg. Great rejoicing. Very slight shower of rain.\n\nWrote to Ida.\n","195":"\n\nCarried water. Four of us built a shelter for one of the gun numbers. I had a pretty rotten job emptying sandbags over the side of a steep hill in full view of the enemys trenches, was sniped at but they were rotten shots & couldn't get within a foot of me. Anyhow the officer made me get down.\n\nThe Turks opened a furious artillery & rifle fire at 5.15 & lasting for 20 minutes. The air seemed alive with bullets & the concussion almost made one sick. They got one of our poor chaps through the head & another was hit by a shell.\n\nI have to go on watch at 6 p.m., one of the men has just gone sick.\n\nThe Turks made a big attack on the left but were beaten back with heavy loss, that was the reason of the demonstration against this post.\n","196":"\n\nVery tired only had about 3 hours sleep. It was a lovely moonlight night, one bullet hit right in the opening of our pit & a piece of cut the boot of a man I was talking to in the trench.\n\nReceived a letter from Mrs Parish with some little trinkets from Australia Day which I was glad to receive. Had to go & get the mail with the O.C. It was a long climb & I had quite a lot to lug about.\n\nHad to move to another shed but we have fenced off and have the little home which has the same name as before.\n\nCigarettes issued today. Amate of Bernie Norrises came into our new house, his name is George Ball.\n","197":"\n\nCrook again. Had to go down & bring about 40 lbs of meat up the hill. This finished me.\n\nTwo men killed & 6 wounded by one of our own bombs.\n\nThings were very quiet, it has been a lovely warm day & a bright moonlight night.\n\nOne of our destroyers lay out in the moonlight, right close to the shore, trying to tempt Beachy Bill to have a shot. As soon as he had he would have been blown sky high by a monitor carrying a 14\" gun & lying right out to sea waiting to locate it by the flash but Mr Turk is too shrewd to fire at night & give the position away.\n","198":"\n\nStill off Duty.\n\nReceived a letter from the mater.\n\nArtillery is very active lately, fleet as well as land batteries.\n\nRum was issued.\n\nThe Island of Imbros is a beautiful sight just before dark. The sun goes down just to the right of it & it looks a very dark blue & eventually fades away, growin the same colour as the sea.\n","199":"\n\nStill off duty.\n\nIt continues cold in the mornings.\n\nLay about all day.\n","200":"\n\nLeon Ferguson wounded.\n\nThe big shed caught fire, several chaps were burnt out of house & home i.e. their rifles, equipment & overcoats went.\n\nThe ships were very active during the night & sent a number of heavy shells into the Turks.\n\nWe are building a new cook house for the cook to keep out the weather.\n\nIt was very cold during the night & windy in the evening.\n","201":"\n\nOn duty again.\n\nCarried up rations.\n\nThere was a demonstration by us at night together with the guns of the fleet & land batteries. The Turks made a very spirited reply.\n\nThe two machine guns were going we had a cross feed in No 2 gun which took a good deal of fixing. Flame absorbers had been made for both guns but collapsed after a few rounds. The Turks exploded a mine, trying to destroy one of our saps, which they failed to do. The Turks use a very fine flare for night use. It gives out a pale yellow light lasting about 2 minutes it floats right down in front of our trenches making every part of them show up. They are only used in case of a demonstration by us.\n","202":"\n\nOn guard.\n\nHad a talk to Lieut Wright. He is acting B.M.G.O. . He is looking well.\n\nHad a shave & a wash. Feel a new man.\n\nBread & cigarettes issued today. It is nice & warm in the sun today.\n","203":"\n\nWent to church & Holy Communion.\n\nTwo friends of Bernie Morris came up in the evening.\n\nI received G'burn papers. They were very welcome and I did not know what to do with myself so I had a good long read of G'burn news.\n\nToday especially in the afternoon, has been the quietest that I can remember, it was just like a Sunday afternoon at home.\n","204":"\n\nOn guard for 24 hours.\n\nVery good war news is coming through from the European theatre, also things are pointing to a big move here shortly which will be eagerly welcomed even if it does mean some hard fighting as we are all fed up with doing nothing.\n\nThe weather continues warm much to our satisfaction.\n\nA very ingenious musical instrument has been constructed by one of the stretcher bearers. It consists of about a dozen empty condensed milk tins which he has tuned up. He uses a couple of little sticks to play them with. So far I have heard him play Home Sweet Home, The Swanee River, On the Mississippi & God Save The King so they are not too bad.\n\nI was given a few lollies & a couple of books today. Truly a glorious haul.\n","205":"\n\nFatigue work getting wood. Had a real good wash in fresh water, first decent one I have had since goodness knows when.\n\nThe Turks have rigged up some new guns & gave one of the guns of our mountain battery hell, about one hundred shells in all. Their shooting was excellent. They have also raked up a heavy gun from somewhere. It sent shrapnel down Monash Gully & got a couple of our chaps.\n\nThere is a constant growling from the guns of the fleet on the right & we are expecting big things to happen there shortly.\n\nWent & had a yarn with Capt Fitzgerald. He is well. Found out that Harrison & Maxwell are both wounded. Also that Capt Fitzpatrick made a very poor showing.\n\nHad bacon & two eggs for \nbreakfast\ntea. It was First Class.\n\n\n","206":"\n\nOn guard again.\n\nIt is a glorious morning. Just like a morning in December at home only not so hot. I am thoroughly enjoying it.\n\nThe rumble of the warships guns on the right is now incessant. They are miles away from us & yet the ground seems to tremble when they are fired.\n\nMac took some papers to Capt Fitzgerald & in the goodness of his heart gave him pretty near all we had in the place. So we are stranded for spare paper till next mail, I'll see that he isn't so kind hearted next time.\n\nWe have been told that we will be out of here by November but in the words of the Scotchman \"I hae ma doots\".\n\nThe 17th Field team of siege Artillery gave \"Abdul\" a surprise. They landed about 12 very high explosive shells in the Chess Board. They were just like young earthquakes.\n","207":"\n\nI had come to the end of my envelopes & had been promised one by one of the 21st​. Last night he had an eye knocked out by a bullet so I went up to his mate & told him about it & said as the chap would not be coming back he would have no further use for them so he could give me a few. I got 8 altogether & some writing paper. \"It's an ill wind - etc\".\n\nChanged my sox today, I have worn them day & night for six weeks. \"This is the life\". The fun of it is that I would not have been able to have a change yet only that I picked up a dirty pair that someone else had thrown away.\n\nBread issued today.\n\nIt is my 24 hrs off & I am taking things easy.\n\nThe fleet continue to keep up a heavy fire on the right.\n\nTwo new aeroplanes recconoitred the Turkish positions under a heavy shrapnel fire.\n","208":"\n\nAnother glorious morning. We are truly in lucks way as far as the weather is concerned. At 7 a.m. there was a great cloud of mist over the completely hiding it.\n\nAm on guard again.\n\nMr Wright came round & was examining the gun position.\n\nMac went to see Capt Fitzgerald in the afternoon.\n\nThings in general have been very quiet today. The artillery in particular has been very light.\n","209":"\n\nHave been crook all day, feel to weak to do anything, have had only Bovril & as there is no bread with it, it is pretty thin tack.\n","210":"\n\nHave been given clearance certificate which will take me off the Peninsula. I am sorry in a way because I don't like leaving my pals but I am too jolly weak to do anything. Mac & Bernie helped me down to the beach hospital.\n\nMail came in today. Had a letter from Beryl & Hilda. I am very disappointed at not getting one from the Mater.\n\nAs soon as I got to the beach hospital Beachy sent a shrapnel along which spattered all over the cases that we were behind & hit one man in the arm, just a few yards away & later killed a man in swimming.\n\nWent aboard S.S. Hospital Ship Assaye.\n\nHad a bit of stiff luck, lost my watch, may be lucky enough to get it back.\n\nMet Bunny Abbot & Arthur Taylor.\n","211":"\n\nVery heavy bombardment in the Anzac zone by both sides.\n\nAm very comfortable here. The food is first class & everyone tries to do all they can for you. Have had a shave & bath. I hope I don't catch a cold (?).\n\nAm just lying about all the time yarning & reading.\n\nI am sorry in a way at being away from the firing line but I was not much use there as I was.\n\n\n\n\n","212":"\n\nLeft Anzac for Lemnos at 5.45.

The rain cleared off by dinner time & the things soon dried off.\n\nAm getting a bit tired of the ship & will be glad to get ashore.\n","216":"\n\nArrived at Malta at 5 a.m. The town is very picturesque & is built more on the Moorish style than anything else. Went right across the bay for orders then came back to Valetta harbour. It is all artificial work & is very picturesque though dirty.\n\nThere were 6 big French ships of war in the harbour, we gave them a cheer as we went past.\n\nI got some fine photographs of the harbour. The usual bumboats came round the ship selling chocolate. All the little pulling boats in the harbour are like the Italian Gondola, only smaller.\n\nWe expect to disembark in the morning.\n\nWe started coaling but stopped again almost immediately.\n","217":"\n\nDisembarked at 11.30.\n\nTook some more interesting snaps & saw a submarine in dry dock but couldn't get a photo of it.\n\nCigarettes & matches were given us as we came ashore also some milk.\n\nWe were put in a motor ambulance & then followed a drive of about ¾ of an hour right across the island to St Georges Hospital. It was a lovely spin & all the roads are perfect so we were able to go at a good pace. The hospital we are in was formely a barracks & it is very comfortable. I am in Ward B2.\n\nThere is some great scenery here & I am anxious to get loose amongst it with my camera.\n","218":"\n\nMet Norm Matthews, he has been here six weeks & is going to England, lucky chap.\n\nLord & Lady Methuenwith their daughter visited the hospital. They were very decent & we were very pleased to see them.\n\nManaged to borrow a bob off Norm, the first money I have had in my pocket for 2 months, it was truly the \"Breaking of the Drought\". We get paid 2\/- per week here but we can get more when we go into the convalescent camp.\n\nThe situation in the Balkans is in a pretty serious condition. By the way things are going there will probably be a big upheavel there shortly. I hope that it turns out all right.\n","219":"\n\nLord & Lady Methuen with their daughter visited the hospital.

Had to give it up till next week.\n\nSome of the prices in Malta are worth noting. Shave 1d., 100 good cigarettes 1\/-, a decent cigar 1d., Haircut 2d., beer 2½ pint. It is a big contrast to Egypt.

After that we took a ride on hired bikes about 3 miles out, at a wayside pub we patronised with the Maltese. I took photos of the mob & gave out \"picture cards\" to a lot of school kiddies. On the way back all went well till we were nearly home, then Sid ran into a donkey & almost immediately after, into me. There was a terrible mix up. The police took a whole host of names.

I will try & get out of it.\n","266":"\n\nTerribly cold have been doing a shiver all day, it is the coldest day we have had here yet.\n","267":"\n\nThe weather is much warmer now.

In the morning everything is fresh, just like spring. There is nothing much to do here except play cards. Just at present I have gone broke on the game. I had some good games of handball today, the first time I have tried it, my hands are pretty sore. This place is a veritable gambling hell, wherever you go you see little crowds round a bed & hear the clink of coins.\n\nI played till about 1 a.m.\n","273":"\n\nDid not go to church, played cards instead, am very stiff from handball.\n\nKnocked of playing cards at about 12 p.m.\n","274":"\n\nWe all went for a bit of a route march in the morning, we went about 3 miles all together & had a pint of beer given to us when we got back & it went well, it is the first I have had since I have been on Gozo.\n\nCards again after dinner & right on till about 3.30 a.m. I am beginning to get a bit of cash back which is very gratifying.Every one gambles here & it is very funny to see chaps who have never done any of it before catch the fever, after a very few sittings they are just as bad as the rest.\n","275":"\n\nAm jolly tired from \nbase\nhandball & late hours but am still playing cards, knocked off early, got to bed at about 10.30.\n","276":"\n\nWas pretty tired this morning had a bit of a read & played cards till dinner time.\n\nPlayed handball in the afternoon, also after tea then we had a game of cards for about an hour.

I ended up under someones bed with the police looking for me with matches but he didn't find me although he nearly fell over me.\n\nWe do lead a fast life in the Army - What?\n","281":"\n\nMore excitement, went into the chief village of Gozo - Victoria. We should have been back by 6 p.m. but thought it too early so we did not return till 8.30 & had to climb a 60 foot wall in the semi darkness, was not at all sorry when we were in as the climb is a bit trying even in daylight as one slip means a drop on to hard concrete below.\n","282":"\n\nIt has come up cold & blowy with showers, occasionally it was pretty rough on the water but the boat came all right though we didn't expect it, we had to mope about all day as it was too rotten outside to do anything.\n","283":"\n\nStill cold & wet. I have a bit of a cold & am not feeling too bright.\n\nThe weather was too rough for the boat to come in, it is the first time it has missed since I have been here.\n","284":"\n\nGot a letter from Bill How from All Saints. He was a New Zealander who was in the same room as myself & we got rather chummy.\n\nI was speaking at a debate this evening & I won the decision. We had a very enjoyable evening.\n\nStill no boat, had to have bully beef for dinner & it was pretty hard to tackle.\n","285":"\n\nPay day. I owed 5\/6 & had 1\/- owed to me.

We left Gozo at 2 p.m. arrived at Malta at 4.30, put in No 1 Section.\n\nMac had lef All Saints today. I said things.\n\nThe rules have been made more stringent here now but I hope to find a way of getting over the difficulty.\n\n\n","289":"\n\nPut in isolation because smallpox had broken out at Gozo.\n\nPinched into Valletta without a pass. Went out to Pieta & came back to camp at about 12.30 a.m. I brought a flask of Cognac back for the boys & it was duly appreciated.\n\nThey are very strict here now & it took me all my time to beat the pickets.\n","290":"\n\nLoafed about all day, tried to get some warm clothing but couldn't.\n\nWe had our Christmas concert at 7 p.m. Lord Methuen was in attendance & it went off very well.\n","291":"\n\nDrew our pay.\n\nI went into Pieta to see Paula.

Weare living in anticipation of our Christmas dinner tomorrow for which great preparations are being made.\n\nThe weather continues very pleasant so we have nothing to grumble about.\n","293":"\n\nHad a first class dinner & a beano in the tent after. We got a bottle of \"Scotch\" from the Sergeants Mess for 5\/6. At about 4.30 we decided to go out so we took a trip to Mesieda , we were all nice & merry when we started to drive home, about 4 miles, I was up on top of the Garry with the driver & while we were going up a hill the horse slewed round & upset the whole bally show. I had the farthest to fall but luckily nobody was hurt but I am keeping a bit of the broken garry as a suvenir. After that we had a real good supper & half a dozen bottles of beer for luck. We had a real good time.\n","294":"\n\nStayed at home, had a good rest & a game of cards, DeMattos & Sheen went out so I went to bed at about 7 p.m. I had a good nights sleep which I needed badly.\n","295":"\n\nWent out to Pieta to see Mrs Grundy & Paula.

I got to bed at about 10 o'clock & slept like a top. I have a bit of a cold just now but otherwise I am very fit.\n\nIt is very hard to get winter clothes.
