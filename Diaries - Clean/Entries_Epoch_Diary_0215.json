Well we were marched to Audruic station a distance of 5 miles and then had to do another perish for 3 hours \n\nwhen at last the train pulled in and left at 7.45AM.\n\nBeing in an open truck did not add to our warmth in any way but eventually landed us at Pont Remy at 5PM. and being pleased at the prospects of a walk my mate and I found our own way to our destination which was Aeo a distance of 9 miles\n","223":" – 16\n\nWe left Aeo – (?) \n\n next morning at 8AM per lorry and in a very heavy fog and proceeded to Bellevue Farm a distance of 45 miles arriving here at 1-30PM. We are stationed at a farm which has not been damaged in any way, while \n\nall other surrounding buildings are wrecked. We learnt later the reason for this. The farm was formerly run by german people. When we arrived we had our dinner cooked by some Fritzy prisoners who are kept here for odd jobs.\n","224":" – 16\n\nI received orders this morning from Hd Qtrs to proceed to Artillery Hd Qtrs.

We laid in shell holes for an hour and\n\nthen proceeded forward but 2 minutes later a beaut lobbed about 30 yards away and a spent piece of shrap hit one of my mates on the foot but did no damage He was sorry because it would have been a nice \"Blighty\" one for him. We had half a mile to traverse to our snug dug out \"the chamber of Horrors\" which we did in double quick time.\n","238":" – 16\n\nLast night about 11-30 PM the farthest end of our dug out fell in and we all woke and felt like saying our prayers. We found it to be a weak spot where nobody was sleeping.\n\nThe incessant rain we are having made the soil very loose. But before long we examined the remaining part and being satisfied it was alright turned in again\n","239":" – 16\n\nWe all set to work this morning and made a first class staircase (with the aid of sandbags) where it had fallen in night before.\n","240":" – 16\n\nAn event happened today which must have its place in this book:- The SUN shone for 3 hours.\n","241":" – 16\n\nThis home of ours is the Chamber of Horrors with a \n\nvengeance.

We found a similar dug out to our \"Chamber of Horrors\" not far away and proceeded to make the best of a bad job in the way of getting comfortable. Everything went well until myself and another chap decided to tuck in for a snooze and not feeling\n\nto comfortable on account of something sticking up underneath our makeshift beds, we had a look only to discover the half covered skeletons of a couple of unfortunate Fritzs. needless to say we returned to our previous home, preferring the water to these weird bed supports\n","254":" – 16\n\nAll day yesterday and today (New Year’s Eve) we have been draining our dug out and now that is is finished we have just heard we are to move out in the morning \n\nEXIT 1916\n\n1917\n","255":"\n\nThis morning we were ordered back to DAHQ which was a great relief for us as we leaving the \"Chamber of Horrors\" behind.\n\nHere at DAHQ it is almost in comparison with our last possie a \"Home\" away from Home although the mud is equally as bad, we have duckboards to walk on from one door to another\n","256":" – 17\n\nExperienced a heavy supply of Fritz’s high velocity shells which were falling in all directions\n","257":"\n\nExperienced another heavy\n\nsupply last night but instead of shells it was snow which lay about 8 inches deep and when looking all around on the far distant hills, one saw a very picturesque country although the larger shell holes and trenches showed very prominently\n","258":" – 17\n\nLeft Pommiers Redoubt and proceeded to Albert for 19 day rest.\n\nhere we are billeted in a slightly damaged Chateau under the name of Chateau Lamont Hurtic called after the recent tenant who was a great \n\nFrench mechanic.\n\nAfter leaving our underground world 40 ft below the surface of terra firma, we come here and are obliged to accommodate ourselves in the top attic room of the Cheateau \"THE ICE CHAMBER\"\n","259":" – 17\n\nWell this is the first DINKUM rest I’ve had since joining the army as for the last 7 days we have had to ourselves but although this place is dead and alive hole and nowhere to go we appreciated the loaf. But O Lor! the \n\ncold is just about the limit. Every thing is frozen hard and stiff\n\nAll the same we have derived one good benefit from these heavy frosts which have made all the mud \"imshee\" (go away) and the ground frozen hard to a depth of 12 inches\n\nIt is the coldest winter experienced here for 22 years according to reports. The only amusement we have been able to partake of is a picture show twice a week. This show is run by the Army in the battered and shelled Cinema Hall\n\nin Albert and is much enjoyed by the troops\n","260":" – 17\n\nFor the last four days we have done overtime in the walking line. We have had to walk from our Chateau in Albert to the lay lines for the different batteries to be ready, when they come into action and of course this necessitated a return journey home each day per boot. This meant a distance of 16 miles a day besides the extra walking between the battery positions over snow and frozen undulated ground which made our legs rather weary, likewise\n\nour bodies and we were ready for bed each night after our usual supper of good old porridge which we are lucky enough to be able to supply ourselves with.\n\nI might mention although we are some 12 miles behind the line, it is a common occurrence for taubes to come over every night and drop from 20 to 40 bombs all over Albert.\n\nThe nearest that dropped to the Chateau fell on the second night after our arrival. It landed about 25 yards from our cookhouse, which had it hit, \n\nit would certainly have meant that we were to go without our rations for 24 hours\n","261":" – 17\n\nWith an early start we proceeded to our next position in action which happened to be at Fricourt Farm\n","262":" – 17\n\nWe have now been here at Fricourt for several days and are still looking for the FARM. About the only remaining landmark left identical to a farm is the stone wall of a room and an ancient well where a stagnant pool of water rests\n\npeacefully in its depths\n\nwell, we are a little more fortunate with our abode as we are in a large hut, which puts our recent dwelling place in the shade for comfort.\n\nStill very cold but two of us were lucky enough to take possession of a French stove which I daresay had belonged to the owners of the vanished farm. This stove had also been used in the cook-house by the unit we relieved. On the stove, which gives out a good deal of heat, there is almost a keen\n\ncompetition between ourselves as far as our cooking abilities are concerned.\n","263":" – 17\n\nNothing extraordinary exciting to report only that the weather is increasing in warmth each day, which we are mighty thankful for.\n","264":" – 17\n\nTo our immense relief we are to move back to a rest area tomorrow which everyone is thankful for as it is some time since our last spell\n","265":" – 17\n\nThree others besides myself were told to leave a short \n\ntime before the main body as we had to walk on account of shortage in transports\n\nIt was a very tiresome walk in mud and rain but eventually we reached our destination at Laviéville a small quiet village about 5 miles from Fricourt Farm\n","266":" to","267":" – 17\n\nDuring this week when not on duty we spent most of our time walking from village to village. There is really not much of interest in these villages and it’s a case of see one \n\nand you see the lot\n\nBut the walking was much appreciated and made more enjoyable by the pleasant surroundings of green vegetation which acted like a doctor to one’s eyes, as all we left behind was nothing but a chaos of mud, tree stumps and shell holes.\n","268":" – 17\n\nFive days ago the brigade returned into action while my unit (DA) remained behind, but we go in tomorrow\n\nBy recent reports the batteries seem to be having a lively time I have just heard of Billy \n\nMcDougall being severly wounded in the head\n","269":" – 17\n\nBilly died from wounds last night.\n\nAt 6AM this morning we proceeded on our way to take up our new position about a mile past Bapaume\n\nOn account of shortage of conveyances, 5 of us came along per boot which we were only too glad of as the cold wind was very severe and the snow falling heavy so we were able to keep ourselves warmer.\n\nIt was a weary journey towards the end as the icy winds were against\n\nus all the way and everywhere was mud and water.\n\nWe managed to hop into a motor lorry about 5 miles from our destination which was a great relief as we had already walked 10 miles. On our way up we passed by all the mud and eyesore portions of the country which we endured for 6 months and in coming through Bapaume till we were about a mile the other side, we found ourselves surrounded by beautiful country, stretching in a flat for a distance of 10 miles\n\nand covered with green vegetation. Here & there were small woods which dotted this great expanse of greenery\n\nThese woods are on the average of two miles apart and each have its own hamlet.\n\nWell we arrived here about 5PM and to our disappointment found no place of abode, as we were told we should. This necessitated our getting to work at once in the snow and constructing a residence from all miscellaneous material collected from Fritz’s old dug outs and \n\nStables\n\nThis when finished presented quite a respectable haven of cover from the snow but it was some draughty believe me, hence our Home\" is called \"BREEZYVILLE\"\n\nIt is a very funny but interesting fact to see how the Australians can make the best of a bad job. It is noticeable all over the Army. It would not surprise me, if say, the Australians were put into hell in the morning, they would have the hide to be selling ice-cream in the afternoon\n","270":" – 17\n\nAs Spring is fast advancing today is perfect and a few of us taking advantage decided to have a look at what was once Bapaume \n\nWell to put in a few words of description of the shattered town, is, it is one huge heap of debris with just the faintest trace to show what a grand and pretty place had been brought to ruin. It is almost heart-breaking to see some of the places. It is just a case of pulling down what remains standing and building up a new town\n\nThere is not one building that has a roof to it let alone 4 walls, even the cellars have all been blown in and all wells and watering places poisoned\n\nAll intersections and crossroads blown up by mines without leaving room at either side for the smallest of traffic. The tall trees planted at equal distance apart years ago on both sides of the streets would prove a very pretty picture in Spring. But all these have been cut down 2 feet from the ground and left \n\nwhere they fell. Likewise all orchards have suffered in a similar manner.\n","271":" – 17\n\nToday we have heard that we move again tomorrow and just as we have settled down after a fair amount of toil in making ourselves comfortable.\n\nFor the time we have been here it has, comparatively speaking, been very quiet as far as shell are concerned, but this quietness was made up for in air-duels which were a daily occurrence.

They are mostly\n\nbuilt of mud & straw, faced over with a thin coating of cement and appear to have been done years ago.\n\nThis particular Chateau is very old but its appearance almost denies the fact.\n\nWe have our signal office on the third floor overlooking the front of the Chateau with lawns and gardens and an abundance of trees.\n","276":" – 17\n\nWe have just been informed that all signallers in the Artillery are being transferred over to the Engineers Unit, which means, in\n\nreality, that we are now attached to the Artillery but come under the orders and administration of the","277":" Div Sig Coy.\n","278":" – 17\n\nOn leave to Blighty.\n\nLeft Belencourt by motor bus at 11AM and called at Ribemont Lavieville, and other villiages for other chaps proceeding on leave.

This was the result of gas shells which refused to go any further and stop with us.\n\nOf course our helmets \n\nwere promptly brought to light and adjusted over our dials.\n\nWell we sat for an hour like this when it was said the gas had floated, so we heaved a sigh of relief to take this disfigured facial apparatus off, but were no sooner off when we were greeted by a loud voice from downstairs proclaiming the approach of a second lot of unpurified air only in a stronger dose.\n\nAnyhow we adjusted our helmets and sat down looking silly at each other for another hour and a quarter when this \n\nsecond lot had passed by enabling us to turn in and resume our doss. Only 2 others besides myself were sick at once, but if I had my choice next time I would sooner have a hard boiled egg.\n","303":" – 17\n\nThis morning at 3-50 I felt rather sorry for anybody on the other side of our front line for at this time the push started for the capture of Pashendale Ridge\n\nTo judge by the flares Fritz began to send up one could tell he wasn’t happy.\n\nOur batteries of all calibres\n\nwhich cover the ground like flies round a honey jar, opened out at the precise moment and with the combined noises of reports and screeching of shells it was terrific. We could hardly hear each other speaking without exercising our lungs to some order\n\nThis noise was reported to have been heard in England for 200 miles The guns continued all the remaining part of the day and everything turning out successfully when, at night it began raining heavily, thus holding up operations\n\non account of mud etc\n\nIn most places our guns were up to the axle in mud and the gunners up to their waists.\n","304":" – 17\n\nAs the weather is still wettish, things are quiet except for an occasional counter attack of Fritz’s in all of which he has failed.\n","305":" – 17\n\nFor the last two weeks the weather has been very unsettled and our front has been held up by a very strong resistance by Fritz but we are pushing forward steadily\n\nAs for aireal activity it is\n\nvery busy and becoming a common occurrence to see Fritz’s planes being brought down and now & then 1 of ours would crash.\n\nAlso at night we get our usual issue of bombs. Last night Fritz dropped one on DA billet killing 1 man and wounding 7 others besides killing several horses.\n\nSid Wilson was among the wounded, but not seriously.\n\nI have only heard this morning that poor old Alec McLennan was killed with a machine gun bullet through the \n\nheart on 31 July.-17\n\nThe batteries here are having their worst time up to date\n","306":" – 17\n\nLast night we had more than our share of bombs.

Every thing at a standstill, all quiet, but there is generally a storm after the quite so they say.\n\nWe are beginning to get an oversupply of rain again. It seems the clouds, which are constantly hovering in the sky, are relieved of their wetness by the vibration of the numerous guns which are incessantly coughing as if they suffer from colds. Some are worse than others and it would take more than a bottle of \"Bonnington’s Irish Moss\" or such like\n\nto cure them.\n\nBut we don’t want them cured, we can put up with the rain and treat it as a joke.\n","311":" – 17\n\nHere we are back again in the same possie which we vacated on the","312":" Inst \n\nOn our arrival here we were accorded a warm reception which goes to point out Fritz’s feelings towards the Australians He certainly does not love them, nor they him.

This forest is said to hold good sport in the way of pheasants, deer etc. During our stay we took a stroll through this large thickly wooded enclosure with its dense undergrowth\n\nIt is a very pretty piece of scenery and the walk was very enjoyable, likewise the cool breeze, which blew gently thro the leave, we found very exhilarating.\n\nThese French woods with all their greenery have a picturesque view of their own, but as we made our way along\n\nthe faint tracks we could not help notice how they lacked the profusion of wild flowers and the scent of the gums which one comes in contact with in our own woods\n\nThe botanical varieties that exist in the woods of France seemed to have been served by Nature quite differently to our native land.\n","315":" – 17\n\nLeft Clarmarris at 8.30 this morning and proceeded per bike to Ouderzeele and arrived at 1.30 PM.

This wall as may be imagined was built for defensive purposes years ago and no doubt the people who built would be surprised to know that it is serving to exceptionally good purposes in this world wide conflict.\n\nThe only available description of the town of Ypres as it stands today after 3 years bombardment, is that it represents one gigantic mountain of debris of burnt and broken timber bricks and dust, in fact\n\nall that goes in the construction of a wooden or stone building.\n\nIn many cases one can see complete huge stacks of furniture brought to complete destruction\n\nThe principal buildings are the Cathedral and Cloth Hall which were structures of great work. These facts one can gather by looking at the minute portions which still faintly show where each building was once standing\n","318":" – 17\n\nMuch to our joy we are away from the Ramparts as during our stay there we were subject to lively\n\nperiodical times caused by bombs and the much feared \"rubber-heel\" shell so named and feared as its’ existence is unknown until it hits terra firma and exploded.\n\nThese are shells of large calibre ranging from 6in to 12in.\n\nAnyhow we are mighty glad to back in Reninghelst again.\n","319":" – 17 \n\nLeaving Reninghelst per bike, 6 of us proceeded to Bailleul a distance of 15 miles.

Do me for a week-ender anyway, with its nice green lawn in centre and skirted on every side by huts. It appears more like a civvy’s soldier camp and we are supposed to be in action.\n\nUnfortunately we will be in action for Xmas Day and for this reason, and to celebrate the occasion, we have selected a committee from the boys of our mess to make arrangements for a \"special\" fair dinkum \"eat-up\". One not to be \n\nforgotten\n\nEach man is subscribing his share of Francs (20) which will make a sum so as to enable us to buy all things that go to make a feed such as soup, fish, ham, joints, poultry, The pudding stewed and fresh fruit, Custard cake; biscuits, nuts etc. Also all varieties of drinks, cigarettes & cigars\n\nThe menu being drawn by one of the boys in the field is to serve each man as a souvenier\n\nAnyhow in action or out of it we are out to make the best of it.\n\nIt will be a change from my last Xmas which was\n\nspent down an old Fritz’s dug out which held pretty well all the mud and slush of France\n","322":" – 17\n\nI must mention a word about the weather as it deserves a little bit of a compliment for behaving a jolly sight better than we ever expected.\n\nDuring last winter from Oct to Jan we had nothing but rain snow and mud to contend with, whereas this year we have had exceptionally dry weather but as regards cold it is intense.","323":" recorded our first fall of snow this year and for the \n\nlast five days and nights it has been one continual frost and is still going strong.\n\nOne would think the ground telephone wires & trees had undergone a heavy fall of snow, but such is not the case, it is frost.\n\nOn looking around on either side it presents quite a pretty picture, BUT also a COLD one.\n\nPoor feet and hands especially sitting up all night on duty as I am at present, from 8PM to 9AM. Oh MY! I don’t want to die. I want to go Home. And yet they say \"cold feet\" can be had in Australia\n","324":" – 17\n\nWell re this Xmas dinner which I mention a few days ago.\n\nIt was a splendid success and one not to be forgotten by all who were partakers. The fact which added 75% to our success was our great luck to be situated in such a position which is not only quiet but afforded every convenience such as to help the committee to leave no stone unturned in their arrangements \n\nWell on Xmas Day our mess hut soon showed signs of festivity as by the aid of willing hands\n\ntables and forms were erected, holly and other greens were artistically decorating the roof and tables while the walls were adorned with paintings and sketches fit for any drawing room.\n\nThe hour decided for the feed up was 6.30PM. and at such time all the lads were eagerly awaiting the word to proceed to their appointed places at the table.\n\nWhist waiting one could not help but notice the grand sight presented by the appearance the country which had just undergone a day’s \n\nfall of snow. Now & then the moon shone brightly as it emerged from the clouds as it moved across the intervening space of clear sky\n\nIn fact it was typical weather for Xmas for this part of the world.\n\nAt last all were seated at their respective places and quite prepared to do justice to the task that lay before them\n\nAs usual a start was made in the way of a speech by the instigator of the function.\n\nThen the ball started rolling and the long long trail began awinding headed \n\nby soup followed at once by its successors, and soon until it seemed to me just like a cinema film entitled \"A Restaurant in a Fit\"\n\nNo sooner had one plate finished when another would take its place. Nevertheless the eating apparatus was kept in motion till 8.15 when the last of the trail had come ∧ gone and with everyone content with the satisfaction of having done good work\n\nIt was just on midnight when we dispersed and made our way to our respective bunks.

Did we welcome 1918 last night? Too True we did. Last nights’ enjoyment, like Xmas night was a great success. The 4 remaining hours of 1917 were passed away to the satisfaction and merriment of all who were able to listen to and appreciate a programme of miscellaneous items bringing out some splendid talent which had been hidden amongst the boys. Added still was the help of a \n\npiano, cornet, violin, mandolin and clarionette to say nothing of mouth organs and bones tin whistles and foghorns. The latter 4 articles being supplied by the Comforts’ Fund\n\nNo doubt it seems surprising to read of such musical instruments being in our possession, especially while we are in action, but with a little running about we secured them and they more than paid us for our trouble\n\nAt any rate did you hear the hullabaloo we made? If not, you should have done so.\n\nJust as the clock commenced ticking of the first few\n\nseconds of 1918 all the aforementioned instruments were promptly brough into action and soon were sending forth numerous lively tunes intermingled with variations and accompanied by some half dozen empty tins bellowing low grunts as the result of continuously coming in contact with heavy sticks. Then again all this melody?? was strengthened by the weird and discordant notes which burst forth from the voice boxes of all present.\n\nNevertheless 1918 WAS welcomed believe me and every one having satisfied himself as to giving his share, sauntered off to\n\nshut- eye until it was time for the first meal of the New Year\n","327":" – 18\n\nRumours are floating around that we go out for a spell in a few days\n\nDuring our stay here at Dranoutre we have had an exceptionally good time in every way\n\nThere is always a show to see at the YMCA any night given by parties from the different divisions, Bdes, or Companies.\n\nThen again by calling on your pins to carry you a further hundred yards you can pull up at a music hall which was \n\nerected by the troops and run by same. Here you can see a cinema show followed by a concert given by one of the many permanent entertaining parties such as the Kookaburras, Anzac Coves, Sentimental Blokes, Cooees, and Wallabies etc\n\nThese opportunities are made full use of providing a chap is not on duty, as it is not often we are favoured with such good chances\n","328":" – 18\n\nMet Tom Reeves whom I had not seen since leaving Egypt.

It is a well known fact that Fritz has more respect for the Colonial troops, especially the Aussie, than he entertains for any other part of the army.\n","364":" – 18\n\nAt 4AM this morning our rumours were all fulfilled by the uproar of gun firing which commenced instantaneously on a front of several divisions\n\nThis, I presume, is the start of a rough time\n\nfor Fritz Hans & Co.\n\nHave just heard that Fritz being quite unaware of anything that was likely to disturb the quietness of last night, was caught and surprised while one of his reliefs was in progress.\n\nSuch was the situation when the Aussies and the other Col troops hopped and now are reaping in prisoners in large numbers. It was even a case of waiting for some of the germans to get out of bed and dressed before being taken prisoner \n\nAlso guns and material were being commandeered \n\nwith great rapidity.\n\nExtensive help was given by the tanks, armoured cars and cavalry, each doing marvellous and almost impossible work. Now & then you could hear a dainty piece of 15 inch \"iron-jelloid\" whistling its way onward through the slight fog, being coughed up by a large French gun stationed on the railway a few hundred yards from our billit.\n\nThe history of this particular gun is more prominent that others of its own size and calibre as it has the honour of being awarded the Croix de Guerre on\n\nbehalf of the gun crew for putting out of action \"Big Bertha\" the big gun with which Fritz shelled Paris.\n","365":" – 18\n\nA few hours after the commencement yesterday the boys were gathering great booty in the way of material & guns and all in good order as Fritz had not time to damage anything.\n\nPrisoners by this time were almost more than could be coped with, so were at once made use of to carry ammunition and rations from the starting point of advance\n\nto the ever forward moving front line and also were given many other urgent jobs which were all necessary for an advance\n\nDuring the afternoon all the prisoners cages were full and it was also an interesting sight to see a long line of german transports wending its way down the main road. Each lorry being driven by a german were captured intact and now were carrying prisoners to cages further back. All being escorted by our cavalry.\n\nSome 5 minutes later our attention was drawn\n\nto a german motor-car also full of prisoners but this time staff officers. \n\nFollowing closely behind keeping guard was an armoured car.\n\nOur cavalry also captured a full train full of germans which had been rushed up to the line to oppose our boys but the cavalry took possession before the germans could detrain\n\nWell now a well earned word must be said of the aerial part of the stunt \n\nFrom the start off the planes controlled by Aussies have been\n\nflying backward and forward across a clear blue sky, each performing its own special duty. \n\nSome taking photos, others serving out an abundant supply of bombs, while others again are conveying machine-gun and rifle ammunition to our boys in the front line.\n\nThe planes on reaching the line swoop low to within 25 or 30 yards and drop the ammunition to the boys who do the necessary with it.\n","366":" – 18\n\nAt 10.30AM we were ordered to proceed to our advanced position, incidentally the \n\nstarting point of the \"push\".\n\nAfter an eventful ride over the shell torn road in the pitch dark we arrived at Villers Brettoneaux and soon learnt that Fritz was still going back at the \"tout\" and also that 4 of our boys had captured the big gun & crew that had been shelling Amiens\n\nThis villiage as may be expected has been somewhat shell torn, with not a building standing. A piece of wall 3 ft square is all that remains of the church.\n\nHere we are living in a cellar which only a few hours previously was \n\noccupied by Fritz officers\n\nWe are very comfortable with dinkum civilised bed, Axminster carpet on the floor and Brussels on the stairs\n\nI might say that Fritz had collected all of this luxury from the surrounding houses. There are also 3 fine pianos here.\n\nWe can certainly rest our carcases on these nice beds but cannot sleep at night after hard floor.

We also got ashore but only for a short time as we are leaving again at midday tomorrow\n","463":" – 19\n\nAfter a run through a heavy storm we steamed into Melbourne at 12 Noon where the majority of the boys were leaving us.\n\nAnyhow the boys from \"Our ‘arbour\" and Bananaland were allowed ashore till midnight.\n\nI had no sooner got off the boat when I met Cliff Kennard. who left us in Belgium 12 months ago and was invalided Home last Nov\n\nWe to Cliff place for tea and after a very\n\npleasant evening returned to the boat at 11PM.\n","464":" – 19\n\nLeaving Melbourne at 7AM it was some 5 hours later when we cleared Port Phillip and got what we expected, some very dirty weather\n\nThe boat having no cargo and only 300 odd boys on board it naturally does the cork act with interest and at present we are tossing to beat the band, but Sydney is only a little way off. \n","465":" – 19\n\nVery little time was spent at the dinner table today as we are just off Kiama and travelling very slow so as to arrive at the Heads by 4PM.\n\nIt almost breaks our heart to be travelling at such a slow pace.\n\nRight on 4 o clock we passed through the heads with excitement running higher than ever it did before.\n\nWhat a glorious picture the harbour presented to us who had not seen it for so long\n\nWe could not have \n\narrived at a better time to catch it at the heighth of its beauty.\n\nI can’t describe our feelings on entering the harbour, or perhaps I was too excited and happy at the thought of seeing Home again.\n\nAnyway we were back at SYDNEY in AUSTRALIA.\n\nBefore I went away I had an idea that Aussie was a good country but now I’m \nam\n certain about it. It will do me to live and die in.\n\nWell at 9AM we pulled alongside the wharf\n\nat Woolloomooloo and a short time after I was being whisked away to the Anzac Buffet and was soon greeted by all the Home Folk and Friends with great excitement.\n","466":" – 19\n\nHere I have been in my own home in Manly for 3 days, but its hard to realise it. It seems too good to be true. But I suppose it will come to me gradually.\n\nThe last 4 years seem to me like a dream of yesterday but when I know of the thousands of boys who will never \n\nreturn and I see the hundreds of returned boys maimed for life or suffering from some severe sickness contracted while away, I feel I have got a lot to be thankful for in not being wounded or having to go the hospital with sickness while away and I am truly thankful\n\n"}}
