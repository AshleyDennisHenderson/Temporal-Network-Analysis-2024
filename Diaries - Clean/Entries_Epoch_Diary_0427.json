The boat has been surrounded by boats containing musicians playing for what they can get & natives selling\n\nDec 3rd\n\noranges, tomatoes, Turkish delight, cigarettes etc. but they are not doing a very good trade as most of the lads are stony broke, myself included. Stan bought some however & I took half of 6d tomatoes & 6d of oranges.\n","105":"\n\nI was on duty last night from 6 till 8 with Hobson & from 12 till 4 this morning with Howard; we lifted anchor at 7.30 last night & had a good reception coming through the town, as we passed the French quarters some girls were singing the Marseilles shortly after we passed an English cruiser the band played Brittania & we exchanged cheers with them; a little later we passed two French cruisers. the band played the Marsailles & I do not think I have heard heartier cheering in my life; I also heard on the bridge\n\nDec 4th\n\nthat General Sir Byrd-Wood was to be over us in Egypt & that we would bring the forces around Cairo up to about 45,000 men. We arrived at Alexandria at 9.30 this morning & found the new Zealanders here at the quay. the Hororota & Omrah are also here at anchor. we put the morning in getting horse rugs, blankets etc ready to send ashore also all our kits are packed on deck ready to land; \n\nStan & I received two letters apiece from Jessie & they were very acceptable (even though they made me feel a bit homesick for an hour or two) being the first mail we have received since we left Australia;\n\nas soon as we dropped anchor here, native boats came out selling oranges 15 for 1\/-, also cigarettes are very cheap, we get a box of cigarettes here for 3d & the same cost 1\/- in Sydney.

The lads were celebrating the last night on the Star of Victoria last night & there were a good many rather the worse for beer; during the night one of the lads either jumped overboard for a joke) or fell over, his name is Anthony Dawson or some such name) \nhe swam around\n \n\nI just heard his mates hat was blown overboard & he jumped in after it & swam around to the gangway & brought in on board. he must have been pretty merry to hop overboard with the water as cold as it was.\n\nI was rash enough to give 1\/- for 4 handkerchiefs at dinner time. also to buy 5 packets of cigarettes for 1\/- so I have been splashing. it is marvellous how cheap articles can be bought here & we derive a good deal of sport cutting prices with the natives. I believe we will be proper jaws when we get home. I speculated 6d on \n\nDec 5th\n\na dozen oranges this morning, tomatoes are also very cheap. we can buy papers here at 3d each & we gave it willingly. Tomatoes, & very good one cost 3d per doz. & nearly every lad on the boat had tomatoes for tea; \n\nSome of the lads also squared the natives to come out to the boat after dark. Slater Tapp managed to get into one down a rope at the stern of the ship before tea & went ashore; after tea several boats were rowing about us & two or three boat loads of lads managed to get away before the game was noticed. 4 or 5 was caught in the act & put in the guard room by Regimental Sergeant Major (Lindsel) he also put an extra guard on & had all ropes & ladders rolled up on deck so the lads will find it a tougher job to get on board than it was to get off. \n\nI believe the Colonel & a boat load\n\nDec 5-6\n\nof officers went ashore to-night, the Col. said he was going to try & get leave for us all to-morrow, but I suppose we will have no chance now. \n\nby tea time we had barracked the natives down to selling \"Alma\" cigarettes 9 packets for 1\/-; 10 cigarettes to the packet. I also bought 4 dozen matches for 6d that is better than paying 9d per doz for them as we do at the canteen.\n\nSun 6th\n\nWas on duty from 12 till 4 AM it was very amusing to see the boat loads of lads returning to the boat. they would all come up on the port side of the boat & then ordered around to the gangway & had their names taken as they came on board; eight came up the gangway at one time, an officer & a sentry was at the top of the steps; the officer turned back for a moment & six of\n","107":"\n\nthe lads jumped over the side of the boat & made themselves scarce, only two names out of eight were taken, one or two boat loads managed to get on board after 4 oclock, up a rope hung over the stern by a guard, there was no officers about so the guard helped them up; McGregor was the only signaller to get ashore but was caught on the way home. \n\nThe \"fall in\" went half an hour early this morning & we were marched up on the boat-deck before the Colonel who said that a lot of men had broken ship & that he would not allow any man leave in consequence & that the innocent men had to suffer for the guilty. I think the idea of the innocent suffering for the guilty rather appeals to him, but I am afraid that it does not appeal to the innocent very much.\n\nDec 6\n\nI think he is a very poor man to be charge of a regiment & his men hate him like poison. I believe a mistake was made in not putting Col. McKie in charge of us; but the lads will not stand being treated like dogs much longer. We were not the only ones to break bounds however, as boat loads from several \nboats\n ships managed to get ashore.\n\nhad some motor launches sailing around to day with some fine looking girls on them. I was on the bridge from 12 till 4 P.M. & had a good view of them.
