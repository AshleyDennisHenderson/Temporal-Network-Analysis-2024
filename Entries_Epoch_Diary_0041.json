Eric Parker & self went up to battery to go over front line. Parker went in morning. Warren, Eric Harding& self had an early lunch, & then went out after. We went up to the O.P. & then after we went down & had a look over the front line. The thing that strikes you most is the absence of men there. We only saw about half a dozen all the afternoon. Saw a party of about 20 Fritzes working at their trenches through a telescope at an infantry O.P. Then saw the Stokes guns having a go at them. We had a shot at them ourselves later & blew all their works down. Fritz hardly sent any back, only a few \"pineapples\" & whizz bangs.

Cleaning harness all morning & I went to Stenwerck for a bath in afternoon. Got another letter from Linda. There was a battery turn out at night but I did not have to go. We heard that Russia had declared a separate peace with Germany, which is the worst piece of news since the war began. I hope its not true, & can hardly believe Russia would be such a cow. Lord it will mean another five years war, & the best part of a man's life in this Godforsaken place. Anyway we have got to win & by Jove we will.\n","131":"\n\nA beautiful warm day. Cleaning harness all day, but I got all mine finished & wrote a few letters. The 26th Battery played H.Q rugby in evening & we won by 26 - 5. Fritz doing a bit of shelling all day.

We packed up & moved off at 10.30 AM & arrived at our new quarters about midday. The horselines are in the open & I have rigged up a bit of a fly & half a dozen of us camp there. Took ammunition up at night. Altogether it is not a bad joint & we have been in a jolly side worse. I saw a lot of the preparations made for the push shortly for Messines & they are marvellous.

Fritz blew up a dump just behind our line & made a hell of a splash.\n\n\n","146":"\n\nFine. I went up to the battery with a working party all day & was moving amunition all day. Old Fritz sent a few over & we sent about ten times the number back. I walked home in evening. I heard the big stunt was starting a week from today & is to be the biggest of the war & there is to be 9000 guns under the one G.O.C. The Tommies are going over first then 4thDiv then 3rdDiv. That is the roumer & lets see how true it comes out.\n","147":"\n\nFine. I went for a bath in Steenwerck in morning, & cleaning harness all afternoon.

We were sniping at an aeroplane in afternoon & went very close to him.\n","156":"\n\nFine & hot. Working about the pits all day & had a good sleep.Just as we finished tea Fritz lobbed a 10 in. shell about 10 yards away & we all got covered in mud getting cover. We evacuated the position then & got in some drains about 50 yards to a flank & he poured the 10 inchers in wholesale till he started lobbing them in our drains when we beat another strategic retreat & wherever we went he followed us. Just on dark he had us penned up in an angle of a creek & he started putting gas shells in & kept at it all night & we camped on the grass in our shirt sleves with our gas masks on till morning & it was the worst night I ever spent.\n","157":"\n\nFine & warm. Walked up to Romarin in morning to try & get out of the gas & although it was lighter there we were not out of it. It was a relief to\nknow\nget out of my gas helmet after being in it for 9 hours. Fritz put about 12000 shells over last night they say the most since the beginning of the war. He was throwing them over all day as well. He threw a lot of big stuff round the pits in evening but did no damage. As I write I am wearing a gas mask & 5.9& 10 in. shells are lobbing round & Lord knows where the next will land. Hundreds of gas shells as well. I have spent a few happier birthdays in my time I was on pit guard with Slade & Warren.\n","158":"\n\nFine & warm. Lying about in the paddock having a sleep in the morning & dodging 5.9& 8 in. shells in afternoon as Fritz sent them over. He lobbed one big one (the only one near the battery) right in B sub pit & killed Cliff Gentle, one of the best fellows going & wounding Anderson in the head. He put a lot into the 25 battery & their& our officers mess, but did no damage. He skittled B sub gun though. It was our turn in the evening though & we made the most of it.\n","159":"\n\nFine & hot. Working round the gun in morning getting amunition ect. into the pits. Fritz started lobbing them round pits in afternoon & we had to clear out. He lobbed them all round where we were, & seemed to follow us wherever we went. He lobbed one near Warren Hogarth &wounded him in head & leg. Poor Warren has to go away & he does not like it. I am glad for his sake, but the battery loses the best man in it. Stimson was killed by same shell & Carver & Shepherd got shell shock. The big stunt starts tonight & everybody is glad. Lets hope all goes off all right & that there are very few casualties. In case anything happens\n\nback toPAGE 32.\n","160":"\n\nFine & hot. We started about 3.10 AM by blowing up a few mines in Fritz's land & then we opened fire & kept at it all day, firing about 1500 odd rounds a gun. It was hell allright. I hear our infantry got over all right, but as usual started singing Australia will be there & ran mad & into our barrage. They got their objective anyway I hear & are hanging to it. Fritz did not send many back today, except a few gas shells in evening. He poured the gas shells in last night like rain & it was rotten working with your helmet on. It was an interesting day but a very hard one. Alf Kay got hit in the eye by a piece of gas shell during the night which exploded in our dug out.\n","161":"\n\nFine & hot. I slept all morning. We were firing all day & towards evening it was the biggest bombardment I ever imagined. They say it must have been hell to be in it. We still hold all our gains. Fritz put a few over near us during day, & late at night one of his planes was over & he started into us with 5.9 in. at day break. He killed one of our \"tommies\" & wounded Jack Coyle & John Astill.\n","162":"\n\nFine & warm. Slept most of the morning and working round the pits all evening, & on pit guard at night.

Working about the pits all day, packing empty shell cases ect. I was one of a party that was going up to get a German gun in front of our trenches. It is about six hundred yards from our front line & about 200 yds from Fritz's line. Anyhow it was off, & I was not sorry. Sent in Bill Slade's name as doing the best work in F Sub. Fritz throwing shells at an old dump in front of us all day, otherwise the line was fairly quiet.\n","164":"\n\nFine & warm. A very quiet day with practically nothing doing. Loading & packing empty shell cases in morning, & I went up to Romarin in evening with Tom Williams to get some supplies. We went to a picture show afterwards & it was great to get away from the noise of the guns for half an hour. It seemed funny to see all the fellows up there laughing & joking without a care in the world & only a few hours ago they were facing HELL & killing men as hard as they could. To see them there though you would not think they could hurt a fly though.\n","165":"\n\nFine & hot in morning, & we had a thunderstorm in afternoon, which made the place very muddy. Working at the pit all day, getting a 60° left switch for the gun as we are going on to another sector. Fritz sending a few back, & we sent a lot of heavy stuff over to him.\n","166":"\n\nFine & hot. Making the pit up all day & got it good again by the evening when we were told we were to move again tomorrow night to an open position nearer the line. Bill Hunter & I got a lot of gas shell nose caps. Heard Spes Wharton was about somewhere in a howitzer battery. Our heavies sent a lot over to Fritz but not much coming back.\n","167":"\n\nFine & hot. Had a sleep in morning & then finished building our pit. We were paid after dinner then we had to go up to 1500 yds of the trenches behind Lawrence Farm & dig new pits. We got the best part of them finished by 8 pm & went back. Our fellows put up a barrage while we were there, & it was a wonderful sight & how anyone can live through it I dont know. We packed up & shifted our gun about midnight & after a lot of trouble got her fixed up by 5 pm. Carrying ammunition & pulling waggons & limbers out all night. The new position is in the open & no copulas or anything only camel fly over us.\n","168":"\n\nFine & hot. Working about the pit all day getting things in order.
