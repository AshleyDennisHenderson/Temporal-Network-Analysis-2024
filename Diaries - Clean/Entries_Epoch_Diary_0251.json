After a short spell on the grass we returned to the ship which was reached at 12.30 without further incident. Had Dinner. Went on deck. Saw gun put on poop deck. Fell in again at 1.45 & marched from the quay to the Police Courts in Durban without the other units which followed at intervals. Dismissed after picket had been fallen in, and Woolley & I hired a Ricksha from there to the ocean baths which cost us 1\/- each. Got to baths at 3 p.m. Had a nice surf swim & a shower which was\n\n24 the first time I had felt really clean since leaving Sydney. After leaving baths we took a Ricksha again to town to the Royal Hotel where Tim Woods, Woolley, Geo. Mathison, Cameron, Tom Peters & I all had afternoon tea. First decent cup of tea since leaving Perth. After having our afternoon tea we all had a roam round the City looking at & buying souvenirs etc. Curios quite out of question as regards price. In fact it costs 5\/- to open your mouth in Durban almost. After posting letters to Flo & Souvenir also at G.P.O. we caught a Marriett Rd tram to the Zoo Gardens & enjoyed the run out on the top of the double decker. After reaching the garden we all had a drink at the Kiosk & returned by another route giving lovely views of the city from the heights at the rear of the city. Came into town again to Police station & met Herb Larsen & waited an hour for Norman Walker but not turning up we all went to the Royal for Dinner for which\n\n24. We were all ready. & after a wash we all sat down & had a great feed. After leaving the Royal, Herb & Woolley & I went round the town while Herb bought Xmas Cards to send home & there being none worth buying I decided to leave mine till I got to the Cape. Met Walker at 8.30 in front of G.P.O. & arranged to meet him again at 9 after he had a bath. Met him at 9 & got into a cheap restaurant- which was the best our tired legs could find- & Norman & Len Bowkett had their & I had 2 glasses of milk & felt fit to bust when we emerged from the place ready to make our way to the boat. We then had a final Ricksha Ride for 1\/2 an hour & after Herb buying some fruit which was greedily disposed of we caught a tram to the \"point\" & reached the steamer again at 10.40 turned in & went to sleep ere long after a most happy day’s fun on the whole.\n","24":" Still in Durban. No leave. Sat on poop & watched coaling till noon. Had dinner & when we had finished went up to find we were making for sea. Got out & found a very heavy swell running. Watched pilot leaving. Sighted the Dutch steamer \"Sonors\" off Durban.\n","25":" Swell still running but fine. Went to Church service morning & night.\n","26":" Sea calm, sighted steamer on coast side\n","27":" Fine day, sighted S. African coast & mountains. Entered Table Bay before breakfast. Tied up at wharf at 9 am. Took water & provisions on. No leave granted at Cape Town. Picket sent ashore. Larsen & Walker went with them. They had a swim. Walker went in with his watch on. We all sat on deck & watched proceedings on wharf & looked round & had a bird’s eye view of the city at a few miles distance. Struck with the beauty & rugged grandeur\n\n28 of the city of Cape Town’s background which rises straight up as a range of rugged peaks to a height of 3-4000 ft. 2 pm. Pulled out from wharf into stream. Coal lighters came alongside. Watched man catching young sharks from the ship’s side. Found the day warm & balmy but a great improvement after the heat of Durban. Had Tea & after T the Colonel gave a Concert to some of his friends from shore. Gave \"Gung a Din\" & \"How the Chestnut Horse came Home.\" Well received. During Concert H.M.S. Kent (our convoy) & \"Argyllshire\" arrived in port. Then turned in on the deck as usual & went to sleep. Reason of leave not being granted was that men from the \"Boona\" played up while there & sickness on board our vessel.\n","28":" Fine & lovely day. Cape Town looks very pretty especially with all the vessels in 1 stream. Argyllshire steamed into 1 quay for water. Rose 6 am as usual & looked around until 7.30 when we went to breakfast.\n\nHad throats swabbed as a precaution against\n","29":"\n 29. Meningitis & other troubles. Also a Formalin tablet 3 times today for the same thing. Did not get leave today & stayed on board. Our Coy did guard & supplied fatigues. I was on Baker & got a cake & some bread. Also saw sports on deck. Supposed to go into the apple-bobbing race, but not being on the spot the race was run without me. \"Kent\" moved to Docks for Coal. \"Argyllshire\" pulled out into stream again. Bought Souvenir of Cape Town & peninsula for Floris, but not being allowed ashore, unable to post it.\n","30":" Still in Cape Town in the stream. Nice day. Rose as usual at 6 am. Did jerks. Had breakfast. No parades. Did jerks & physical culture under Bill Allan’s direction for about an hour. Then read \"Ginger Mick\" to the boys on the deck at the Group’s request. Much speculation & thousands of latrine wirelesses as to leaving. Fed up of being in port & not going ashore. Hope to sail in the morning on our.\n","31":" ‘16\n\n30 last long spell of travelling. Big storm coming at time of writing this. Cleaned up knives & scissors with emery etc on account of rust. Got an orange in a scramble on the deck this morning which were given out by the Y.M.C.A. George Ravell made a defaulter through handing a letter to a coal lumper which contained information which were contrary to Military Orders. Given 10 days C.B.\n","32":" Rose 6 am. Ship weighed anchor at 6.15. On our way at 6.30 am with H.M.S. Kent as our escort. Glad to leave Cape Town the more at not being allowed ashore. Argyllshire, Boonah, Marathon all in the one convoy.\n\n2. Nothing unusual. Sea still moderate. No concert. Travelling at night in darkness. Sub. warning in morning. Gun fired first time & shook hell out of the ship.\n","33":" Church parade. Service conducted by Walter Willey. Nothing of any consequence. Sighted the \"Ayrshire\" on starboard side. Kent set out & spoke her & being satisfied to her nationality allowed her to pass on. Caused a little concern on board when first sighted on horizon. Service on Poop boat deck in afternoon. Had sing song. Madden taken ill with Meningitis. Condition critical today- I was awarded most popular entertainers prize of 10\/- for last Concert.\n","34":" Rose 6 am as usual. Spent an hour or two learning \"Comrades in Arms\" Quartette for Concert on","35":" Nothing of importance happened saving that I had a bath (in a bucket as usual.).\n","36":" Rose 6 am. Did Jerks etc. Spent most of morning on practising Quartette. Had Picture on Deck by Lt. Parkinson. After Dinner & the \n","37":" usual swabbing out we had usual jerks on 1 deck. Then had more practise & came on deck to watch sports practice. Duncan Woolley got hurt in wheelbarrow race with Jack L’Estrange. He fell on his neck & face & was badly bruised. After tea went on deck & spent the rest of the daylight in playing Quoits with the boys. Nothing startling happened today.\n\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12} Nothing special. Smooth trip. All sorts of rumors. Received news of fall of Bukarest. with disgust. Entered tropics & felt off from the time we did so. Had touch of heat stroke.\n","38":" Entered port again. Dropped anchor in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Africa 3 pm today. 12 transports in the bay. Some in","39":" weeks. Expect to be here some time. Very hot & sultry in tropics. Long for the\n","40":" cooler weather. Freetown is a very prettily situated place. It is built on the side of very high mountains which come right to the water front & away to the sky line as far as the eye can see.\n","41":" Leave granted 11.30 am to 4.30 pm on shore. Left ship in a barge after standing in the bottom of it – in the boiling sun- & sweating \"till our bloomin’ eyebrows crawled\". Reached & clambered on shore & was glad to catch some dirt again after about 3 weeks on the water. Found Freetown not what we thought it. It is not a modern town at all, as its appearance from the ship suggested but a dirty lot of old hovels infested with blacks of all grades & nationalities- but mostly low & immoral. In fact the natives here have no morals at all even from the children up although it does not strike one\n\n14. as a pity for they seem so black as to be akin to the animal. At midday we hunted for a place to get a feed & not being able to do so went to one of the stores & bought some biscuits.\n\nWe, Tim Woods, Duncan Woolley, Herb & self (we having left Norman on the ship in hospital with a dose of Malaria) made our way to the Gardens, if such they can be called, & on our way thither bought some fruit & repaired- with our guide- into the gardens & had a rest & some eats after which we again made for town. Went to P.O & sent some P\/cards to Flo, Cal & Jim of Freetown which were the best procurable. Then went through native quarter & had a good look round. Had a drink of English Lemonade at a native shop & the funny incident of the kid with the water running to get out of Tim’s road who was trying\n\n14 to get a snap of him. After wandering round till we were full of it we again made for the quay- via the 2’6’’ gauge Railway Stn; Had a look at it. On reaching the quay we saw a Military Funeral of an Australian lad, the native soldier doing all the swank necessary. The coffin was made & supplied by the \"Sympathetic Undertaker\" of Kessiy St whose place we had passed previously in the afternoon. After purchasing some fruit & lining up we marched to the barges again where I took good care to get a side seat & then left the shore again for the ship, not a single man being sorry to leave the place where everything is taught the natives by the Church.\n","42":" Our Coy being on duty no shore leave was given Engineers. Did the usual Bakery work which was all I did that day.\n","43":" Our Unit supplied picket on shore for our boat but I was not in it. Did nothing all day except have the usual immersion in the afternoon.\n","44":" Went Church 10.30. Nice service by Rev. Forsyth. The ship’s complement had to coal vessel. Engineers had first go. Made good fist of it. Mr Gray & Mr Dumas in it up to their necks. Was not picked so did not help. Did not feel too good & was rather glad. Day very hot. Men looked like niggers coming from coaling. Took Duncan’s photo while he was in this state. Norman discharged from hospital. Not too well.\n","45":" Helped Coal ship in afternoon. Looked like Uncle Tom’s brother when I was through & felt as if I had \n","46":"\n 18. ventured too far into the hot place. Got a bath & then was informed that a Concert party was to be sent off to the HMS Kent that evening in which I was included- in the Quartette. Left ship at 7.30 pm in Kent’s pinnace & had a lovely spin across the harbor. The party included Rice, Willey, Pates, Wilson, Cameron, Mathieson, 6 Stewards Adjutant & O.C. Troops of our ship. When once aboard we saluted the Quarter Deck & were taken by the Padre to the Officer’s smoking Room where drinks & smokes were dealt out in true naval fashion. After getting some smokes & booze into us we went on 1 Quarter Deck & the concert (program of which I have) began. The Quartette rendered \"Dear Little Shamrock\" & \"Comrades in Arms\". The programme was an excellent one & more cigarettes were put at\n\n 20\n 18. our disposal. After two-three hours entertainment which the Tars enjoyed- judging by the manner in which they cheered us after the conclusion of the program- we were again treated to drinks & cigarettes after which we again boarded the pinnace & set out for \"Home\" again whither we reached at 10.40 & thus ended one of the pleasantest evening’s enjoyment I have ever experienced.\n\n 20\n 19. Still hot. Duncan Woolley went into hospital with slight concussion of brain caused through his cranium becoming forcibly moved into contact with the hard deck whilst engaged in a wheelbarrow race with Jack Lestrange a week or two back. Concert party from \"Kent\" visited \"Marathon\" in return of our visit. Proved to be very enjoyable. Sat on Hatch for 2 ½ hours before it began \n\n 20\n 19 in order to have a good seat & view of the performers. Got program of items. They also showed slides through a lantern. No items by any of the boys. Finale of their bill especially fine. Gave big cheers as they ended their bill at 10 pm.\n","47":" Nothing much doing today. Still no fresh water to wash in. Visited Duncan Woolley in Hospital & found him much improved. In afternoon Mr Gray gave us a French lesson. At Night the Kent’s band paid us a visit. Still as hot as hell itself.\n\n21. Very hot still at Freetown. All on board were hoaxed today when the ship began to move forward under her own steam. Turned out to be only a move further out into the stream. Saw Duncan & found him much better. Had a\n","48":" washing parade. Used rain water from last night’s big storm which I got out of one of the boats. Day went off much the same as usual.\n","49":" Still at Sierra Leone. Very hot & sultry. All sorts of rumours about leaving. Wrote article for book on our Departure from Sydney. Saw Duncan again. Found him much better.\n","50":" Duty Day. On Guard. Kept Anniversary in silence though thoughtful & with a mind full of impossible hope. Scratch Concert on Deck. Did 3 turns.\n","51":" Came off Guard. Very tired. Told we had to go to church. Rather annoyed. Got it over & got into few clothes & had dinner. In afternoon lay on deck. Eat Coconut & oranges. At night Quartette sang Adeste Fideles at church meeting on deck. Did not go round to sing Carols as was intended as we felt too tired after guard.\n\nCoaling won by Engineer party. £2.\n","52":" Rose 6 am. Attended R.C. Service (Mass) to sing in Quartette Adeste Fideles. Had breakfast & then on deck. Church parades 10.30. Sang again at C of E & Other Denoms. Services. Had Dinner. Special- Pork, Peas, Yams. Fruit (shouted by our Officers) & Sago pudding which looked like a gathering storm but tasted O.K. We also had cigarettes given us by our O\/C. Gave 3 cheers to O\/C troops & Captain Jermyn. Also our officers.\n\nH.M.S Swiftsure arrived today. Saluted her as usual.\n\nKing’s message read to troop prior to Church parade. 3 cheers given for His Majesty; on deck. Afternoon . Lay on Deck & slept.\n\nEvening. Sang Comrades in Arms at Sacred Concert on deck.\n","53":" Rose as usual at 6 am. Had Breakfast & on parade at 9.30 as usual.\n\n26. At 10.20 am anchor was raised & with \"Kent\" leading the way the Marathon & 3 other transports sailed out of Freetown Harbor. Met calm & tranquil sea. Nobody on board sorry to leave this hot shop of a place. Had hammock parade in afternoon. Morning & afternoon we had lectures on First Aid by Joe Fern. Very interesting. Had tea & after tea had to get our hammocks out without the aid of lights. Found the job inconvenient & rather annoying. Had game of 500 with Larsen, Mc Nab & Woods in Sergts Mess. \n","54":" Parade as usual. Fine day. Saw tropical sunrise at sea. Very fine sight. Caught up with strange steamer making same way as us. Fell in with convoy.\n","55":" Weather much cooler. Feeling difference in change of \n\n28. longitude. Nothing special. Had lectures on points of the war gained since the outbreak by Mr. Gray.\n","56":" Nice day. On warm side. Getting cooler. Fell in with a big convoy of 6 ships:- French cruiser, Orotava, Argyllshire, Boonah, Afric, Beltana which with us, Marathon, City of Sparta, Borda, Durham Castle & HMS Kent, made up, after much revolution for places, the entire convoy. After 11 am the Orotava turned away again towards Dacca. (Dakaa). Had lecture on General Engineering points in morning. Afternoon did some Morse signalling. Kent sent a party of men off to the Boonah. Evidently some trouble on her as the Kent turned right astern & made towards her. £2 won for coaling devoted towards defraying cost of the Souvenir. Won on a vote\n","57":" Nothing important. Nice day. Still in the race home. Weather cooling now.\n","58":" On Guard. 5th time. New Year’s Eve. Did duty on Officers’ Bar all thro’. They had concert for N.C.O’s in smoke room in evening & all hands there mole-o. In fact I was not impressed with the way things went. Their revels ceased toward 11 pm when I was relieved. Did not want to see the close of 1916. Thought of home & friends & love & all that was far away & went to sleep with a countenance more in sorrow than in jest.\n","59":" New Year’s Day. Came off Guard feeling very tired. Slept on deck part of morning & listened to lecture by Mr Gray the other part. The fact of being in a New Year did not trouble me\n\n1. much but I wondered what all may be doing at home & wishing I was there. Turned in at 6.45 under Decks as we were running into a big storm & feared rain. Slept until 6.30 next morning.\n","60":" Rose as usual 6.30 6.30.

Got hot tea at 10.30 & 12.45 for the guard & then turned in in the orderly Room & slept (brokenly) till morning. \n","66":" Monday, Cold, wet, - windy- in fact everything that is nasty. Not a warm spot on the ship except under decks. Too rough to dismiss the Guard on Deck. Stood on the poop (under the lee, & watched the\n\nantics of men endeavouring to walk the wet decks at intervals between the rolling of the ship. Many laughable scenes here took place. No parades this day. Packed our bags & ordered to make all preparation for disembarkation early on the morrow. Much joy at the thought of our long trip coming to an end at last. Had several strong blows & also sleet & hail on the deck throughout the day. 6.30 pm. Engines slowed down. Much speculation about cause. Re started at old speed in about ½ hour when we were again on our way North. Picked up Eddystone Light about this time on the Port Bow. Got 40 miles out of course this Gale.
