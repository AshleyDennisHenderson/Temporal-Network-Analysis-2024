Poss, Warren, Ken Radford & self went down to 25th Btysports ground & had a few jumps on the horses.\n\nHad a battery sports meeting in the afternoon.\n\nFriday, 22","80":"\n\nFine & sunny. I was orderly officer for the day. I took a gun out & came into action in an open position to get some practice with open sights. I got a good position on top of a hill & practised on motor lorries. The General was round the waggon lines during the morning. I played hockey with the 7th Brigade against D.A.H.Q. & they beat us 8 to 5 but we had a good game. Warren & Poss had a hit at polo in the afternoon.\n\nSaturday, 23","81":"\n\nFine & sunny. I was pegging out a sports ground all the morning to hold a battery sports meeting in the afternoon. I got it all finished & just as it was all ready we got orders to move off at 4 pm. We all bustled round & were on the march by 4.5 pm. If anyone had told us to get packed up & move off in under 2 hours we would have said it was impossible, but we did it. We moved out through Sec-Bois to a place near Morbeque . The horses were out in the open but men have good billets. Nobody knows where we are going, but as there are roumers of a big German push down south, I suppose we are making that way. Anyway we were all sorry to leave our billets.\n\nSunday, 24","82":"\n\nFine & sunny. We moved out of our waggon lines about midday & passed through Morbeque and Aire to Witternesse, where we camped for the night, in pretty rotten billets. We had a perfect day for marching though & the troops rather enjoyed the day. There were grave roumers about Fritz's big push down south. They say he has broken through & got lots of prisoners & guns ect.\n\nMonday, 25","83":"\n\nFine but cold. We moved off at 8.30 AM and marched to Valhuon via Lambres, Furfay & Pernes. We got rotten horse lines but good billets this time. Hear Fritz has done great things down south, but he has got cut about terribly. He employed over 50 divisions. I hear we are holding him a bit now though. The country down this was is very very pretty. It is all rolling hills ect which is a great change from the flat of Armentieres.\n\nTuesday, 26","84":"\n\nFine but cold. We moved off at 8 am and marched to Humbercourt via St Pol. We did not get to camp till after midnight; & it was about the longest days trek we have had (30 miles). The roads were crowded with troops, guns, motor lorries ect all making back. We heard all sorts of roumers about Fritz breaking through ect. Also that we were making a push up north, & had got Ostend and Zeebrugge.\n\nWednesday, 27","85":"\n\nFine, but dull & cold. We shifted out at 9 am for another 20 mile trek. We passed through Mondicourt & along the Amiens road, which was packed with the usual number of vehicles during a retreat. We heard all sorts of wild rumours again about Fritz's push. He mad a big one through all right. As far as we can make out a lot of the Tommies just cleared out & let him come & now they are waiting for us to stop & hold him. This the colonial troops did as soon as they went in. We had to go into action straight away. The position is an open one on top of a hill, with waggon lines a little to the rear. We left the firing battery waggons with the guns & slip alongside. Real open warfareÃ¡ la A.A.T.\n\nThursday, 28","86":"\n\nFine but very cold rained a lot in evening. We did not get up till nearly midday & we were all just about played out. We fired several times during the day. The infantry advanced a couple of thousand yards during the day. All the troops made little dug outs in the bank behind the guns. They went into a couple of deserted villages round about and had a great time. They got fowls, pigs, lambs, pidgeons ect & as they were only issued with a sixth of a tin of bully beef & a quarter of a biscuit each they had a welcome find.\n\nWe shifted again at 1 AM to another position about 3000ydscloser up.\n\nFriday, 29","87":"\n\nRaining during the morning, & cleared up in the afternoon, but a very cold wind blowing all the time. Our position is a pretty good one, & the troops have plenty banks to dig into, which they did & made themselves very comfortable. They had more foraging raids & have plenty poultry ect to eat. I suppose this is the most disastrous thing that has happened to the Allies, yet nobody seems to care a hang;in fact they treat it more as a joke than anything. We fired a few hundred rounds on line targets during the day. Enemy aircraft were active all day, & ours seemed quieter. We have not heard any war news now for days, so don't know what is going on away from our particular sector.\n\nSaturday, 30March 1918\n\nFine & raining by turns all day. I was the orderly officer for the day. Fritz put a pretty good barrage over our right in the morning & attacked, but the infantry cut him to pieces & he retired. A stray shell (4.2) fell about 6 yards from No 6 gun & knocked out the whole detachment. Tom Walker was killed, Bill Hunter wounded slightly, Jack Hunter wounded badly,Jim Gannon had his ankle smashed, & Piper was wounded in the ankle. It was hard luck but could not be helped. I got several letters & a packet of handkerchiefs from Eileen.\n","88":" Battery brought down a Fritz plane with their Lewis gun.\n","89":"\n\nFine most of the day, but came on to rain in the afternoon. I was on battery O.P. all day & had a great time. There were hundreds of Fritzes walking about & I had a great time with them. Also got onto several of his batteries in the open & tuned them up properly. I had a great time altogether. Got a couple of parcels at night.\n\nOur artillery concentrated on Morlancourt in afternoon for 20 minutes & bashed hell out of it.\n","90":"","91":"\n\nFine & fairly warm. I was not on any particular duty so had a real good loaf in the mess, most of the day. The troops found a bat & ballwere playing cricket outside the mess most of the day. I took over brigade O.P. from","92":" Bty at 5 pm. Lt. Heenan & I went down to have a look at a French Chateau in evening & its a shame the way the troops have pulled it about. We were nearly shot by machine gun bullets coming home.\n\nOur C.O. (Col. Churches) the Adjutant (Capt Greenshields) & the orderly officer (Ken Radford) were all killed by a 4.2 shell falling on Bde H.Q. They were all killed instantaneously. The","93":" Bde is attached to the 8th Bde temporaly for tactics.\n\nTuesday, 2","94":"\n\nFine. I was at the OP all day. Fritz has quietened down a lot now & you dont see much movement at all. I got on to a couple of transport columns in the evening though & gave them a good hiding. Major James has the 7th Bde now temporaly and Lt Smith as Adjutant & Lt Bates as orderly officer. I got a parcel from Jo with some socks and jam in it.\n","95":"","96":"\n\nFine most of day, but clouded up in evening with a few showers. I was orderly officer for the day but things were very quiet & I did not have much to do. Cody was at the OP all day & he had some sniping at Huns. I wrote toLinda, Mother, & Mrs Hunter.\n\nThere was a big stunt on the south of us just after dusk, but I dont know if it was ours or theirs.\n","97":"","98":"\n\nRaining most of the day. Fritz made an attack to the south of us, & drove the Tommies back about 1500 yards. We got on to him after with the artillery though & cut him up a lot though. We fired about 800 rounds during the day. I went up to the O.P at night and camped there. Things were very quiet & wet up there.\n","99":"5","100":"\n\nMisty rain most of the day. Fritz put a barrage down to the north of us, & extended it to our front. He attacked to the north and drove our fellows (4th Division) back about 500 yds. but they came to him again and cleared him out. It was the first barrage I had been in & I dont want to be in any more. He was sniping at us all day with whizz bangs & machine guns as well, so we did not have too good a day; especially as the trench we were in was half full of mud. Fritz shelled us with a lot of ourown 18 pounders during the day. A few shells lobbed near the battery in the barrage but no damage done.\n\nSaturday, 6","101":"\n\nFine all day, but came on to rain at night. I was orderly officer for the day, & was up at4 AM firing harrassing fire. There was a very big barrage on our left just at dusk like one of Fritz's practice barrages. Just after dark a big bombardment started to the south of us. There was great aerial activity all day. Our planes brought a Fritz plane down about 100 yds from us in the morning. He crashed & burst into flames when he hit. Fritz got three of ours during the afternoon. I got a parcel of cake from McVitties. \n","102":"","103":"\n\nFine in morning, but rain showers & hail during the afternoon & evening.\n\nWe fired a lot for registration purposes during the day, but otherwise things were very quiet indeed. Fritz's aeroplanes were active again during the day, but ours were very quiet.\n\nCapt. Glover (from 17th Bty) took over command of the battery today & Capt. Colquhoun went down to the waggon lines.\n\nFritz put about a dozen 5.9 shells just in front & to the right of our guns. He had a lot of balloons up all along the front so I suppose he spotted us.\n\nGot word that Fritz was making a big attack on south, but it did not come off.\n\nMonday, 8","104":"\n\nRaining hard nearly all day. I was on O.P. duty, & had to stay in the trenches all day & never saw a Fritz. Poss & I went down to the waggon lines this evening. Watt & Hogarth came up. The waggon lines are not much good as they are just a sea of mud & we have a rotten dug out which leaks like Hell. Nevertheless I got 5 letters from Linda & some from home when I got back, so everything is O.K.\n\nTuesday,9April 1918\n\nFine & misty all day, but came on to rain in the evening. Capt Colquhoun & I rode down to the immobile waggon lines, near Behencourt in the morning to have a look at things. Lay about our waggon lines & read all afternoon & went to bed early. Fritz was shelling a lot in our back areas all day. He shelled a lot at the battery & got C sub gun and Eddie McLiesh (wound in head & leg) and Gunner Lawler (wound in backside). Think they were our own 18 pds he was shelling with.\n\nWednesday, 10April 1918\n\n\n\nDull, with several showers. I was orderly officer for the day, but beyond balkingthe watering parade there is not much to do. Poss went down to the other waggon lines & then on to 27th W.L. for dinner.\n\nThursday, 11April 1918\n\nDull in morning but cleared up to a good day. I left the waggon lines early to get some stuff for the mess in the back area. I went back to Vignacourt about 25 miles back & then hardly got anything.\n\nWe heard roumers of a big German push in the Armentieres sector, but dont know how true it is yet.\n\nThings were very quiet round here today.\n\nFriday, 12April 1918\n\nFine & warm, like a spring day at home. Poss & I & Robinson (27th) went in to Amiens for the day. Fritz has shelled & bombed the town very heavily and everybody has left it. We got some omlettes for dinner I bought some tinned goods to take home. I had a look at the cathedral there & it is a marvelous piece of work. Fritz is trying to shell it & it would be a sin to smash the place up. The ride in is a very pretty one, as the trees along the road are all coming out in leaf.\n\nThere was a lot of gun fire south of us, but our front very quiet. There was a couple of Hun 'planes brought down though. We got an order to have 300 rds per gun at the position and no dump at the W.L.We sent 900 rds up in the evening.\n\nSaturday, 13April 1918\n\nFine all day, but very dull & foggy, & it came on to rain at night. I was orderly officer for the day, and was at the waggon lines all day. Warren came down for the day, & is all O.K. Hear roumers that Fritz has done very well in his push up north.\n\nSunday, 14April 1918\n\nFine & dull & very cold, with a strong wind. I went into Amiens to get some stuff with a mess cart, but all the shops were shut. Fritz was shelling pretty heavily there. He lobbed one in a convent with 32 nuns in it and wounded a couple. I took them to a hospital & fixed up about getting the others away. Got a letter from Mother & a cake.\n\nHeard the French had advanced 9 miles on a 19 mile front.\n\nMonday, 15 April 1918\n\nFine but dull. I went down to the 27th Waggon Lines for a bath in the morning & my word it was good. I had not had my cloths off for a month, so it was appreciated all the more. In the afternoon Poss & I reconoitered the tracks we use in case of a retreat across the Ancre. I came up to the battery to relieve Cody after. The whole detachments changed over during the morning. We did a lot of harrassing fire & Fritz did not return much.\n\nTuesday, 16April 1918\n\nFine & dull. Watt was at the OP all day. Warren & I stayed at the guns & did all the harrassing fire. We also put a lot more dirt ect on our dug out. Capt Glover went up to the OP in the morning & down to the waggon lines in the evening. Albert tower, with the famous figure of the virgin leaning from the top was knocked over at 3.42 pm today. There is a French legend which says that the \n€‹\nworld\n war will end when that falls. Hope its true.\n\nWednesday, 17April 1918\n\nFine till midday then came on to rain. I was up at the OP all day & slept there at night at night. I had some pretty fair sniping during the day, and got one cove that I know of. Capt Glover was up ranging the battery on the zero point. Fritz chucked a few near the battery, & near the O.P. in the evening.\n\nThursday, 18April 1918\n\nRaining in morning & cleared in afternoon, but there was a very cold wind all day. Warren relieved me at the OP in the morning. Camped in the dug out most of the morning and built up the entrance a bit with sandbags in the afternoon. Capt Glover went down to the wagon lines in afternoon. I got a parcel of tobacco. Fritz shelled round battery in the evening. One of our 'planes was circling round just before he fired, & then it circled round some troops & he opened on them. I think it was Fritz using one of our 'planes.\n\nFriday, 19","105":"\n\nFine, with some snow & very cold wind. I did some harrassing fire in early morning & then was in the dug out most of the day. Fritz put a few fairly close to us. The Capt & Warren & I did not get up till late, & the Capt went up to the O.P. in the afternoon.\n\nSaturday, 20","106":"\n\nFine & warm in morning, but very cold in afternoon. I was at the O.P. all day, but did not get much shooting as Fritz is getting very careful about showing himself. Fritz was supposed to come over the bags this morning, but he didnt. He was exceptionally quiet with his artillery also, but his planes were very active in the evening.\n\nThe whole Corps put up a counter preparation shoot for half an hour in theevening & put over about 14000 rounds.\n\nSunday, 21","107":"\n\nFine all day. Warren was at OP all day. We did not do very much shooting during the day. Capt Glover went up to the OP in afternoon. I wrote letters & got a lot off my chest.\n\nThe 44th Btn brought the famous German airman Baron Von Richtofen down in his triplane with Lewis gun fire.\n\nMonday, 22","108":"\n\nFine. I was about the battery all day. The men all changed over at midday and Watt went down & Poss came up. There was a big stunt to the north of us after dark, but I think it was ours. There were plenty of planes about, but bar one Fritz we got early in the morning we did not see any scraps. Capt Glover went down & looked at some new waggon lines. I got a wire from Linda.\n\nTuesday, 23","109":"\n\nFine & sunny. I was at the O.P. all day. There was not much movement to be seen near enough to shoot at, but plenty in his back areas. The Capt came up with me to the OP in the morning & went on to Btn HQ after. I dug another OP for ourselves where we could see our zone from. Saw a German triplane bring one of our 'planes down. He shot his wing clean off. Fritz shelled us twice with whizz bangs during the evening. He burnt all the camelflage off F sub pit & put the wind up the troops but otherwise did no damage.\n\nWednesday, 24","110":"\n\nFine, but dull & misty. Fritz started out to make things nasty at 3.40 AM & he poured the gas shell in good & solid till nearly midday. He put a lot of H.E. further back and got a few casualtys. We thought he was coming over but he did not. We fired on him several times during the day; & he used to blame a group of batteries on our right as every time we fired he used to put it into them. I rode over to HQ in morning & found the C.O. the only man left there, all the rest of the officers & men had been gassed. He quietened down towards evening.\n\nWe shifted our waggon lines back further today.\n\nThursday, 25","111":"\n\nFine, but very misty most of the day. I was about the position all day. Had some shooting practice & a game of cricket in the afternoon. Got orders that we were to be relieved by some \"Pommies\" (105th Bde) & we were to take their places in a \"position of readiness\" the other side of Heilly.\n\nFritz was very quiet all day, except for a few gas shell over us into the valley.

I went up to the OP first thing & relieved Poss. I was relieved by a \"pommie\" at midday. The \"Pommies\" relieved us all right & we took over their guns ect. As usual we had to start & make things ship shape again. They did not even know the point their guns were layed out on. We got back to our old home at the waggon lines again. Spes Wharton came over & had tea with us at night. Fritz was exceptionally quiet all day & we did not give him too much.\n\nSaturday, 27","113":"\n\nFine & sunny but rained a bit at dusk. I was about the\nwaggon\n lines all day fixing up our home. Brigade H.Q. also shifted & dug into a bank alongside us. Poss & Warren went down to the waggon lines, & Warren went on to see Spes for dinner.\n\nThis position is a damn good one. We are a silent battery and only fire on S.O.S. calls. Its about the best time the troops have ever had I think.\n\nI got a letter from Linda, Mother & Cam Williams. I got my second star today but wasanti dated to 28thFebruary.\n\nSunday, 28","114":"\n\nDull, & came on to rain in the evening. We were round position all morning.

Some of them moved very nicely for heavy horses.\n\nThe major & I went round for a ride after & did not get home till late.\n\nFritz was over bombing all round this evening.\n","139":"May1918\n\nFine & hot, with a dashing thunderstorm in the afternoon. I went out to Grandstact with Lt Makey (107th) in morning & then on to Abbeville for dinner. Abbeville is a pretty big place, but he has bombed it so regularly that most of the people have gone. Those that have not gone go out & sleep by the canal at night. The Colonel was round shaking everybody up today & making a damn nuisance of himself generally. The battery held a bit of a swimming meeting in the afternoon and it was a great success. They also ran the finals of the team horses out.\n","140":"May1918\n\nFine but cool. Out on battery manoevures all the morning. The brigade major and colonel ect were all up there making a bally nuserance of themselves. We had a brigade race meeting in the afternoon at Epagne to pick the horses for the divisional meeting on Sunday. We had a jolly good afternoons sport out of it. The 26thBattery came out on top again with 3 firsts & two seconds. Our fellows played the Yankees baseball also & beat them by 18 runs to 1.\n\nOwie Cadell came back to the battery & Lt ABC Laing from 2nd Division T.Ms joined us.\n","141":"May1918\n\nCool & showery all day.

The Colonel inspected the troops at 10 AM & as usual found somethingto rouse about. I wrote letters ect most of the afternoon & played cards at night. The Major & Warren were away at a Court Martial all day.\n","142":"May1918\n\nFine, but dull. We went out on manoevures all the morning. The C.O. was there but did not have much to say, as we got along pretty well. There was a pay parade on in afternoon & after that I went down to watch a signalers contest between the batteries. The 107th beat us by 1 point for the first place. The Major & Poss & I went for a ride in the evening after dinner. Major & Cody at a court martial all day.\n","143":"May1918\n\nFine & warm. We had no parades in the morning except stables, & in the afternoon we all went to the Divisional Race Meeting at Epagne in the afternoon & had a great time. It was an excellent little meeting & very well run. There were a lot of nurses from Abbeville there also plenty of WAACs & french people. The Army Commander (General Rawlinson) & all the Corps & divisional commanders were there. I came out about square on the books but won three sweeps out of four so they pulled me up a lot. All our troops rode down & had a great time. We had a concert in the Chateau grounds at night to finish up a very happy day with.\n","144":"May1918\n\nFine & warm. Capt Colquhoun & I went went into Abbeville for the day, & had a good fly round. Went up to No 2 Stationary Hospital in the afternoon and saw Nurse Macdonald his cousin. Had dinner intown & rode home in the cool afterwards.\n","145":"May1918\n\nFine & warm. Out on battery manoevures all the morning, & the Colonel had an inspection of horses & harness in the afternoon & went dead lousey because it was not clean for inspection. He ought to have known better, as it takes a couple of days to clean harness for inspection not a couple of hours. All the men went through tear gas after to test their helmets after having new eyepieces put in them.\n\nI went for a swim in afternoon, but it was very cold.\n","146":"May1918\n\nFine & warm. I was orderly officer for the day. Took the horses out & turned them out ina paddock all day. Haddrivers cleaning harness all day ready for the C.O.s inspection tomorrow.\n\nI got a bit of a chill yesterday while swimming which sent my temperature up & made me feel a bit crook so I went to bed at dinner time.\n","147":"May1918\n\nFine. I felt a lot better but my temperature was still up so stayed in bed all day. Got word we were moving back to the line at 10 AM tomorrow.\n\nPoss, Serg. Harrison, Cpl Cogle, DorsDear, MaCathy, go over to the R.B.A.A. at 5.30 AM tomorrow for six months.\n","148":"May1918\n\nFine & hot. We moved off from Cocquerel at 10.30 AM & marched to Hangest for the night. We got there about 2.30 & got everything clean & had a swim & camped on the bank of the river that night. We were all very sorry that our spell was over because we had a great time down there. Poss and the others went over to Blighty early. I got Poss's little mare \"Molly\" and the Major took my blue horse.\n","149":"1918\n\nFine but cooler. Moved off at 9 AM & marched to our waggon lines at Glisy via Picquigny and Amiens, arriving in time to get things fixed up before dark. The 38th Battery are in the lines yet but we dossed down beside them. They are great lines, right amongst some trees on the edge of the Somme. This seems a very quiet sector as far as we can see. My word he has knocked Amiens about though, it was about the 4th biggest town in France & now there is no one in it at all.\n","150":"1918\n\nFine. I came up to the battery position early with the Major and took over. Warren & Laing brought our guns up after and our limbers took theirsback. The position is the most beautifully cameflaged one Ihave ever seen, in a ploughed field dug in & covered over with dirt & harrowed over. We have one gun in Villers Bretenaux & I came up to take charge of that with C sub detachment, we live up here altogether & its not a bad place either.\n\nWe shot the guns in on the zero point in evening & they were shooting very well indeed. I did liason in the evening with the right battallion (43rd). Fritz tried to raid one of our posts but he never reached it.\n","151":"June1918\n\nFine. I was knocking about the OP in the morning & then went looking for another O.P. in the afternoon but was not very successful as there was tomuch gas in the village to go poking about much. The Major was up in the morning but had to go back again. The Brigade Major was poking round about lunch time. Fritz was fairly quiet most of the day.\n","152":"June1918\n\nFine & warm. I was knocking about the town all the day. The Colonel, LesCholmey & Rex Money were round in the morning & the Major rode up in the evening. I went over to Cachy in evening to the brigade O.P. & found it a rotten place. Major Irwin was wounded there just before I got there.\n\nFritz was pretty quiet all day & night.\n","153":"June1918\n\nFine. I went straight from Brigade OP to the battery for breakfast & then came on up here after, with W. Snowden & Cpl Cullen & they got my gun into action again for me. I shot it in & got two hits out of two shots on zero point. I went down to Rt. Btn. H.Q. & did liason after tea at night. Fritz was shelling back a good bit all day. He had a lot of baloons up all day & his 'planes were fairly active. S.O.S. went up on Bde. on our left at about 10 pm.\n","154":"June1918\n\nFine. I was about the forward gun & the OP all day. The Major was up in the afternoon & we had some sniping with the forward gun, & had some good fun. Warren got a bit crook andwent down to the waggon lines.\n\nFritz was very quiet till lunchtime when he stirred things up a lot.\n","155":"June1918\n\nFine. I was about the gun & OP all day & had some great sniping during the afternoon& think I got several casualties.\n\nFritz put a few over fairly close to us during the day but nobody hurt. The Major went to finish the Court martial he started at Cocquerel. I went down to liason atnight.\n","156":"June1918\n\nFine & warm. I was about the gun & OP all day. The Major came up in the afternoon & we had some great fun sniping Fritz all the afternoon. Fritz opened out on Villers Bretoneux about 8.30 pm and bashed hell out of the place with guns of every calibre. He kept more to the other end of the town though than where we were. We were all down the cellar. He gassed the town & back country all night.\n","157":"June1918\n\nFine & warm. I was about the gun & OP all the morning. Lt. Laing & a fresh gun detachment came up to relieve us after lunch, and I went down to the main battery position. Fritz put over a few very close to the forward gun about midday but did no damage. We carried out some harrassing fire at night. I got a letter from mother saying she was going to London & was ready to leave at any time, also a couple of parcels from her.\n\nMonday, 10June1918\n\nFine, with a couple of little showers that hardly laid the dust. About the battery all day. Fritz was registering a 5.9 in on a road inn front of us all the afternoon. At 9.45 pm we opened a bombardment (a creeping barrage) on Fritz as a diversion while the 7th Inf Bde made an attack on the ridge between Morlancourt and Sailly-le-Sec which they captured with 2 officers 231 other ranks as prisoners also a lot of machine guns & trench mortars. They advanced 750 ydson a 3000 ydsfront. The","158":" Bde made a raid on our sector as well. I heard my application for special leave had been squashed.\n","159":"\n\nFine. I was about the battery all day andread & wrote letters most of the day. There was to be a raid on our front during the night, but owing to some short shooting it did not come off. Fritz was very quiet all day & he did not retaliate much to our barrage at night.\n\nI got a parcel of tobacco from home.\n\n\n\nWednesday, 12","160":"\n\nFine. I was about the position all day reading. Everything was very quiet during the day. Fritz hardly fired a shot all day. There is a kind of influenza going round amongst the troops and nearly 50% of the fellows here have it. It last for a few days & then goes off. Tim Lamrock was round today. He is attached to the 8th Bde as M.O.\n","161":"","162":"\n\nFine. I went down to the waggon lines for a\nspell\n swim & a clean up. I had a swim & it was beautiful to feel clean again. There was a concert at the waggon lines in the afternoon & it was pretty good. They had a piano and the 33rd Btn band there. I got back for dinner at night. The ride down to the waggon lines was the prettiest I have seen for a long time. The country is just a mass of colour with the wild flowers. Fritz was pretty active with his 'planes and artillery all day. He put about thirty 4.2 in very close to the battery. I got a couple of parcels of tobacco from home & a cake from McVitties.\n\nFriday, 14","163":"\n\nFine, but cloudy. I was about the\nwaggon lines\nbattery position lines all day. The Major went up to the OP in the afternoon and shot all the guns on their S.O.S. lines. Fritz was very quiet till evening when he put down a heavy burst of fire (4.2 in) on gully in front of the position. We got word that he was coming over the bags in the morning so I wonder what will happen, if he does come. He may get through but his losses will be terrible. I got a wire from mother, & a cable & letters from home & Coomoo Coomoo.\n\nSaturday, 15","164":"\n\nFine. I was about the battery all day reading & writing letters. Fritz did not come over as we expected he would & was fairly quiet during the night, & very quiet all day till evening when he put down a very heavy burst of fire on the battery position, & harrassing fire all round it. He lobbed a couple of 4.2 in within 6 ft of our dug out which will just about keep out the rain. Our planes were very active over his line; 40 and 50 being over at a time. He had lots of baloons up during the morning.\n\nI got letters from Mother & Poss Nivison.\n\nSunday, 16","165":"\n\nFine in the morning & light showers during the afternoon. I was about the battery all day & Hogarth came up & relieved me in the evening & I went to the waggon lines. All the men who had been up there all the week were relieved. Fritz was pretty quiet all day, & after the show he put up last night it was about time too. During the night (15th) he put bursts of fire all round us till after midnight, wounding T. Williams slightly and Maddison P.C got shell shocked.\n\nWe put down a barrage for a raidand Fritz anticipated it & got onto the party with 5.9 shells & they never got across.\n\nCody went to the forward gun & Laing came to the battery.\n\nMonday, 17","166":"\n\nFine, but cloudy in evening. I was poking round the waggon lines all day. Went for a swim in the afternoon but Fritz started bursting HE on the bank so I came out & got out of the way. Otherwise he was very quiet during the day. Laing was down for the day; & he & I went up to look at the big French 13.5 in railway gun. My word it is a monster too. Blue Slade came back & camped here for the night. He is looking A1 in his officers uniform. I got a letter & a wire from Mother.\n\n\n\nTuesday, 18June 1918\n\nFine all day but came on to rain at night. I was knocking round the waggon lines all day. The Major came down & had a look around & went back in the evening. Capt Colquhoun went on leave in the morning. He took a shell case (75 mm) over for me. I got several home lettersand some from Linda, so the world is not a bad place at all today.\n\nFritz was bursting shrapnel over us all the morning & H.E round us. Its not such a spell as it seems coming down from the guns, as I think we get more shells here than at the battery, & shells are hell where you have horses.\n\n\n\nWednesday, 19June 1918\n\nFine in morning & came on to rain a couple of hours at midday. I was about the waggon lines writing letters in the morning and I took an N.C.O from each subsection round to look at our 1st, 2nd, & 3rdZone positions if we have to retreat. They are not bad positions, but pretty open.\n\nWatt & I went over to 65th Bty RFA mess & played cards after dinner at night. I got a letter & cake from Mother. Fritz was very quiet here all day, but put a few round the battery I believe.\n\nThursday, 20","167":"\n\nFine all day but rained a bit at night. I was round the waggon lines all the morning.

Both of them are well & looking fit.\n\nFritz was a bit active with his H.V. guns during the day. He got on to the D.A.C. waggon lines in the morning but luckily did no damage. He put a lot round our waggon lines in afternoon.\n\nI got a letter from Linda & one from Mrs Macdonald.\n\nThey expect Fritz over in the morning. I wonder if he will come this time.\n\nThere are great roumers that the Australian Corps are going to be relieved shortly. I hope its true, thats all. But I \"have ma' doubts\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, 22June 1918\n\nFine. I was about the waggon lines all day. There was a half holiday in the afternoon. The 17th Btn held an aquatic carnival on the water hole at our waggon lines, & had a damn good afternoons sport. The landing stage fell in with all the officers on it at the end though, luckily I was on the end near a pontoon & did not get wet. Bob Worthington was there & he came over for dinner at night & we had a great yarn.

His aircraft were very active all day, & he forced one of our observation planes to land behind the battery in the morning. Great news in the paper about the Austrians being in full retreat & the Italians after them as hard as they can go. We may get home in a couple of years yet.\n","171":"","172":"\n\nFine, but came on showery all the evening.

My word, its the most monotonous life anyone could imagine, just loafing about a dug out day in & day out.\n\nFritz was very quiet all day but put down a few very heavy strafes on us during the night. He was very active in the air too all day & brought one of our baloons down. None of our 'planes showed up at all after the hiding they got a day or two ago.\n\nThe tommy engineers knocked off work on our dug out after putting in a hole 10 ft by 9 ft at each shaft & a passage 2 ft 9 in connecting them.\n\nSaturday, 29","177":"\n\nFine & hot.

Both jolly good sorts.\n","207":"","208":"\n\nFine.
