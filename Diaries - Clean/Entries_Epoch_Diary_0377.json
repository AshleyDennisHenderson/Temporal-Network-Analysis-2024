Watched the Diggers box then they had a sing song. The diggers have started a dancing class.\n","219":"\n\nCalm again all day. Played quoits. Did P.T. & played cards. Passed Canary Islands at tea time. Quite a lot of boats in the harbour & two quite decent Towers. More boxing after dinner & a cinema show. It was goodo too. Gee the remarks of the diggers was funny.\n","220":"\n\nChry's & Madge's birthday\n\nBeen thinking a lot about the girls today. Hope they had a pleasant time. Very dull today. Felt like sleeping all day. Played quoits & cards. The diggers had a concert in the evening. It was very poor tho'.\n","221":"\n\nVery warm indeed today. Coy. Orderly Officer today. Had to fill in a lot of forms about deferred pay. Got inoculated against flue. Saw quite a lot of dolphins & showers today. Also on ship. Another cinema show tonight it was quite good.

Had a muster parade in case we had lost a digger but everything was correct. Am on guard again. My hours are 9 to 1 twice. Not at all bad. Bonny breeze all day. Played my tournament game of quoits with my partner. We won fairly easily. I played poorly tho.\n","223":"\n\nNothing to do all day. Fairly windy all day. Played patience & 3 handed bridge. Supposed to be opposite Sierra Leone this afternoon. Am going to bed early 10 pm.\n","224":"\n\nVery windy all day. A little rain. Not much tho.

Should pass the equator tomorrow sometime.\n","225":"\n\nCrossed the line this morning. Colonel caught us playing poker & asked us not to play. We then played sevens & he thinking we were still at poker came over & said 'Gentlemen, I asked you not to play. Am I to call the adjutant' When he saw it was sevens he bolted. Bonny day. My arms & face got horribly sunburnt. Was judge today for 4 fights. They were all good & required just a little bit of thinking out. Didn't give a bad decision at all. Am pleased. Saw the Southern Cross for the first time.\n","226":"\n\nNice breeze today. Read most of the day, but gee I'm some unsettled. Can't be bothered reading for long. Must go for a walk somewhere.

The fancy dress people had their photos taken. Some of the costumes were rough. Particularly the colonels & one or two diggers. Had pillow fighting today. Some of the fancy costumes had a try too. An officer had a good civvy suit pinched last night. This is the third lot. It appears a digger went into the cabin locked the door & passed out the suit thro the port & then got thro himself. All officers were inoculated against flu this afternoon\n","228":"\n\nCold & windy today. The boat is rolling a bit. Had a meeting of officers about the thieving this morning.

The officers team pulled F Coy diggers team in tug of war & won 2 out of 3. The end of the boat won each time. Some 40 odd diggers had a bolshivick meeting & demanded more deck space. Silly old colonel gave it to them too. Think he's frightened of them. Gee its icy cold tonight. The boat is rolling & pitching to some order too.\n","229":"\n\nVery cold again today. Still a big sea. Quite a lot of the diggers are down with sea sickness. Did absolutely nothing all day. Saw another whale. Came third in the big sweep & got 10\/- but was halves with another officer. Still 5\/- is handy any old time. The C. O. received a petition today from 240 diggers asking for the release of the prisoners. It was refused.\n","230":"\n\nOn guard once more. Have only the birds to concern ourselves with all day but in the evening we still have to look after the whole ship. Some more boxing today. Two very good fights. The third was poor. Should be some good ones tomorrow. Quite a lot of rumors flying around as to where we are going. Cape Town or Durban. The first I think. Still a heavy swell on & the boat is moving some. My hours of duty are 11 am to 1 pm. 5 pm to 7 pm. 1 am to 4 am.\n","231":"\n\n2 am Some cold. Still big sea. Old ship creaking some. Went to bed at 4 & up again at 8.30. Nearly crashed for brekker.

Finished my long series of letters to Nettie. Was 24 pages.\n","234":"\n\nWent in alongside No 2 wharf at brekker time. Kept waiting till about 11 am before we were allowed ashore. Got a car from the wharf to the P.O. & posted our letters. Bought some post cards & some camera stuff & then had tea. Wrote the post cards there. Went into a jewellers & had a look around & then round to the Grand Hotel for lunch. Couldn't get any there till late so wandered out & went to some cafe. Very poor. After lunch spoke to a person & he told us to get a car & go to Hout Bay for a spin. We did & it was goodo. Very pretty all the way. Table Mtn. was enveloped in clouds all day. Visited Rhodes house & gee it is bonny. His taste was good. Had dinner at the Mount Nelson hotel & came back about 9.45 pm. The Main was berthed next to us.\n","235":"\n\nThe Main is a family boat & gee it is some rough. Do hope dear old Nettie doesn't strike one of these things.

Our mails left today by the Edinburgh Castle. Took a few snaps. The old boat is rolling some. There is a big land swell. Ate oranges from the Comforts Fund & read some aussie papers after dinner.

We are 10 men short.\n","236":"\n\nStomach upset. Will have to take some Gregory's. It doesn't take much to put a color on my tongue these days. Think I want a lot of football. Read today & did a bit of printing. All my photos of Cape Town turned out well.\n\nFeel upside down tonight. Just can't be bothered doing anything.\n","237":"\n\nSee the coast all day. Saw a few farms. Very little of the ground tho was cultivated. The majority of it looked very bare with trees & shrubs here & there & plenty of rocks. Nice big breeze. Read all day. Played a few hands of rummy & sevens after dinner.\n","238":"\n\nReached Durban about 8 am & went in to the stream about 9 am. Tied up alongside another till 3 when we went in to a wharf taking the place of a departing passenger boat for Blighty. Niggers everywhere. The boys threw down pennies then the niggers fought for them. On guard again. Did my first relief at 5 pm. Everything quiet till 6.30 pm when the Adjutant came along & we found two prisoners missing. Some row then. Sent out search parties but they were missing alright. Never found them up to 10 pm.\n","239":"\n\n5am. On duty again. No sign of missing prisoners. All sorts of theories. Court of Enquiry at 9 am today about it all. Have warned our sentries to be there for it Came off at 9 am. Had brekker & then into the Court of Enquiry. Gave my evidence. Told everything I knew. It was adjourned till Friday. Went up to a few shops in a rickshaw with Fraser. Came back to lunch. After lunch Shelley & I went up to town. It is a big place but don't like it as much as Adelaide. Did some shopping & then went & saw the All Blacks beat Natal 17 points to 3. Was a good game. Ground was fair. Had turf on it but was of poor quality. Came back to the boat for dinner. More than half the officers did the same. After dinner Forrest, Dalrymple & I went to see a show at the Criterion. It was half picture & half Vaudeville. It was very poor indeed. Had coffee at the Royal hotel & then got a tram & came back to the ship to sleep. The Borda from Aussie came in a midday & is berthed alongside us.\n","240":"\n\nNice & bright today. Old Botha is dead. Crossed over to the bluff in a ferry & walked a few miles along the beach to a big whaling Coy's cutting up & melting down station. No whales in. Had a look at the place. Nothing in a whale is lost at all. Oil, bones or flesh. Flesh & bones made into manure. Went back to the boat over the hill. Took the sweat out of us too. After lunch went into town & down to the beach. Had one or two ices. Did some shopping & then came back to the boat. It had moved over to the coaling station. Have to go & come by ferry now. Expect to go to Pietermaritzburg tomorrow. Have two parties.\n","241":"\n\nNo Maritzburg for me today 'cos the Court of Enquiry is on.

Had a race with a train & won. Had lunch at an hotel out there & then rowed to the end of the river. Got out there & walked up a steep hill & visited a few Kraals. Very good. Took some snaps. Every snap we took of a nigger we had to give 6d. Dead funny. Kraals were very clean. Cow & pigs etc. don't sleep with the family but outside in an enclosure. Had dinner at the Marine Hotel (the best in the place) & then came back to the boat. Had a most interesting day. It rained again just after we came back.\n","243":"\n\nLeft Durban about 9 am.
