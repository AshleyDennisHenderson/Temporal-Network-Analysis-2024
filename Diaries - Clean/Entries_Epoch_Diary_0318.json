1st\/18. Tues.\n\nMarked day in Stone. Very quiet to what it was in the old days. Went into Sale Yard with Ern Harvey, but all the stock was gone, although it was only about 2 pm. At night Mrs Sam & Jenny & I went to a Whist Drive at St Michael’s Institute. Met crowds that I knew. None of us won a Prize, but it was a most enjoyable night.\n","2":"\n\nWent to Pantomime at Theatre Royal, Hanley. \"Tommy Tucker\". It was rotten. Had Tea and Supper at Pat Astbury’s.\n","3":"\n\nWent to Burslem with Mrs Sam, Harry and Fanny. Had dinner at Harry Ibb’s place then bade them \"Hooray\" and returned to Stowe. Met Mr Sockett on Stowe Station, also met Mrs Bailey from Tillensor. \n","4":" \n\nPaid a number of visits around the Town. Mrs Ibbs, Newcastle Road, Louie Collier and Fred. Saw Freddy Jacks, Mr Jeffries, the Piano player, and heaps of people, who enquired after Mother & all. The Photos Mr Jacks took of Ibby & myself turned out Failures. At night we had a Sing Song and Cribbage.\n","5":" \n\nGot Mr Jacks to take a few copies of the enlargement of Lill and me, as it is too big to send Home. Ern and I went to a dance at St Michael’s Institute, but I got too giddy and had to give up.\n","6":" \n\nIntercession Day. The Council headed by Mt Geo. Bagot led a procession to St Michael’s Church. I intended to go but got up too late. After Dinner Ern and I paid a visit to The Cemetery where mine and Ern’s Fathers are buried quite close to each other too. All the Hotels closed all day. \n","7":"\n\nHad Tea at Mrs Hambleton’s Brewery Stables. Met Lizzie Wamlow in the Town, who asked me in to Mr John Harding’s to have a cup of Tea. She said the Col. said he would very much like to meet me, as he knew Father so well; but the day I called he was out & I never bothered again.\n","8":"\n\nMarket day again. Went into Town with Ern. Met Mrs Blakeman & Mrs Jack & Sybil Straw. Mrs B was quite put out because I had not paid them a visit, so I promised to go out there tomorrow.\n","9":"\n\nSaid \"Goodbye\" to Mabel and Mrs Harvey and Fred, and wended my way to the Station. Met Ern at the Star. Went out to Shirley with Ruth and Mrs Jo. Abe met me at the station. Stayed there that night. Slept with Frank.\n","10":"\n\nWent to see Lizzie and Joe. Had dinner there. Returned to Ferris Farm. Then caught Train for London. Ruth saw me off at the Station.\n","11":"\n\nLast night slept at War Chest Club. Furlough ended. Caught Train at Paddington at 12.20 came away to \nSutton Veny\n on the famous Salisbury Plains. After fooling around for a time, we were told off to different Huts. I was jolly tired and slept soundly, though it \nwas\n on the hard floor.\n","12":"\n\nBugle blew at 7. How pleasant(?) it sounded. Hopped out of Bed, rushed over to \"Ablution\" Place and washed under the Tap. It is jolly rough, after being used to Mable or Mrs Harvey to bring me hot water.\n\n \nWrote Letter 1 to M.S.\n \n","13":"\n\nSnowed heavily all night and it lies about 6 inches deep. We were all lined up for classification. There must have been nearly a thousand men on Parade. Someone threw a snowball, and that started the Fun. If an officer put in an appearance he was bombarded from all quarters. It got so hot that they marched ‘em away out of the Road. I was exempt from the Route March \nas I was inoculated last Sat.\n.\n","14":"\n\nUp for classification again. After a few hours waiting about in the cold, we eventually got inside. Maj. MacKenzie passed me and marked me the same as I was on Sat. B.1.A.2. At night he sent for me. So I went up to his quarters, where I stayed to Supper and had a good old yarn.\n\n \n","15":"\n\nRain, snow and Frost all mixed up. The roads are in an awful mess. On Sunday we moved from No 10 to No 7 Camp. It is much better here as we have our meals in the Hut and don’t have to crowd into a Mess Hut. Yesterday we were issued with our gear. A load big enough for a Pack mule. I’ve got a rotten cold. Really ought to write some Letters, but can’t settle down to it.\n","16":"\n\nMore Route marching. On parade they called out for some men to work at H.Q; so I hopped out for one, as I’m sick of paddling about in the slush. I reported at 5.30 and was put on as Waiter in the Mess. Plenty of good tucker and it’s \ndry\n.\n","17":" \nFRANCIS’ Birthday\n\nWeather rotten, snow, hail and wind. Doing pretty good at Headquarters. The only draw back is that one has to work so late. They have a formal dinner every Thursday night and it keeps us busy. Wrote to France.\n","18":"\n\nGot a letter from France today. She seems to like Egypt alright. There is a lot of talk going round the Camp about us going to Egypt, but I don’t think there’s anything in it.\n","19":" \n\nI have been sleeping in 8 Hut, No 7 Camp, but it is a fair distance away from H.Q., and is a nuisance if one wants a wash or brush up, so I spoke to the Corp. about it, and today I moved my things up to the Fire Station which is quite near. At night I went to the Canteen and won 6\/- playing House.\n","20":"\n\nWell I wonder if I shall fill this book up with War News. I sincerely hope not, bur I must say that the war news does not look too promising. Today the weather is much better, so I went for a stroll. Met Bucky Howard. He was evacuated from France with Trench Fever. Maj. Mackenzie was telling me about Bob Roberts. He was quite surprised to hear that Bob was dead. I wonder who will be B. Sec Sergeant now.\n\nMon. 21\n\nDick Scholer is on the Staff here, in the Hospital Orderly Room. Mole is in the S.M.O’s office. There is quite a crowd of 8th chaps here.\n\nI wonder where my mail has got to. It’s about time some arrived. Bricky has had Letters dated Nov 21, but my last from B. A. was Oct 19. Weather good. Nothing to report.\n","21":"\n\nGot a Letter from Stan Wright also an old one containing a Picture of the Botts; and my membership card. Also got a Letter from a Lady from Hawthorn, Vic, congratulating me on getting the M.M; and a Xmas Card from Stan’s Mother.\n\nToday the Camp Commandant went to London to be decorated with C.M.G. \n\nJust as we finished there was a Fire, so we went over to the blaze and found it was \"the Blood House\" on Fire. (A place of amusement). From what I make of it the show was rotten and the crowd demanded their money back. This was, of course refused, so they set it on Fire. It was only built of wood and composition Roofing and blazed away merrily. Every man in Camp must have been there. Some officers tried to get the men to return to their Parade Grounds, but their efforts were useless. One crowd got hold of the Piano.\n","22":" (cont)\n\nSome chap sat on a Box and played \"Australia will be there\" and other popular airs, and soon the whole crowd were singing \"Keep the Home Fires burning\" etc. The Fire Brigade arrived when the place was nearly burned down, and were just connecting the hose, when somebody cut it. Just when I left they were talking of putting the Piano on the blaze. There were a number of buglers there and they blew the \"Last Post\".\n","23":"\n\nThe main topic today is last night’s fire. We walked along to view the remains, but these are only a few boards of it left. It is a fine day. No mail arrived yet. Yesterday there was quite good news in the Paper. The \"Goeben\" was sunk and the \"Breslau\" driven ashore. In Austria a million and half workers are on strike.\n\nIt rained heavily after Tea. Stan tells me that our crowd are up near Boulogne.\n","24":"\n\nAnother Big day. It is Guest Night at the Mess and keeps us busy. The Housekeeper and Edgar are at daggers drawn, and \nsomething\n is going to happen. No bloomin’ mail in yet. Weather pretty good.\n","25":" \n\nEdgar got his orders to \"March out\", so that counts a victory for the Housekeeper. The Corp went away on Leave, too. Bob took over Edgar’s job, Williams D.L.S., is working down at the Hospital.\n","26":"\n\nMet Paddy Duffy in Camp, He is looking well. Was in the same Hut as me at Liverpool.\n\nBought a new writing Pad and commenced \nLetter No 3. To B.E.\n The war news doesn’t look too promising. Weather still good.\n","27":"\n\nGlory! Alleluia. At last I got a Letter from Lill. What a Beauty. One of the Best she ever wrote. It is dated Oct. 16, but \nthat\n doesn’t matter, it’s just as welcome. Finished No 3 and also wrote to Nell. Must write Mother tomorrow. \nSun night.\n Must ask Lill if she ever received any copies of the \"Tattoo\". Not much use me being Sub-Editor if she didn’t. Had afternoon off, but having no decent clothes to wear I stayed in Camp and read thro’ some of B.E’s Letters, which are \nalways\n interesting. Wrote to \"Westy\" Harefield. This time last year we were at No 4. Post, in front of Bapaume, and strange to say, my diary for that day, commences just the same as this. I got 9 Letters Mon. and 3 of ‘em were from M.S., and it’s exactly a year ago today Peter Murphy was wounded. Must tell Lill that. \n","28":"\n\nGot paid this morning, drew 15\/-. Also went to Q.M. Store and got a pair of riding strides and puttees. The Pants are too big, so that means I’ll have to change ‘em. The weather is fine.\n\nThere is a very fine Band attached to this Command, and the O.C. is very proud of it. They went to London last Friday and returned today. Got P.C’d from \"Jacko\".\n","29":" \n\nAir Raid in London. They did a lot of damage, but there’s not much in the Paper about it. The nights are quite moonlight, just the weather for Fritz to come over.\n\nStayed in the Hut and commenced \nLetter No 4 to Lill\n; also wrote to Mother.\n","30":"\n\nGood old Lill. Got 2 more Letters from her today and one from Mrs Pudmey. Mr P. has been in Bed for some weeks with a Broken Ankle. Lill’s Letters ate the first I have received from her to say anything about my being wounded. Poor old Girl, \nshe\n \nwould\n be worried. \n\nYesterday I went up for classification but was told that my card was not there and I wouldn’t be wanted. Today I was up before \"the Beak\" for missing classification, but after my explanation the case was dismissed.\n\nAt night went up to the Kitchen and wrote some Letters. It is much warmer there than in our Hut.\n","31":"\n\nAnother busy day. These formal dinners keep things humming. To see the Menu one would never imagine there was a Food Shortage in England.\n","32":"\n\nBig Air Raid over Paris; and a lot of damage done. I thought Paris was invulnerable to plane attacks, but was evidently mistaken. \nWrote Letter No 5 to M.S.\n Got another Letter from her tonight dated Nov 21st. They are the only Letters I have received since being in this Camp, and they were jolly welcome.\n","33":"\n\nBill Beards and I were on this afternoon, but we shall be \"off\" tomorrow. The weather is good.\n\n \n","34":"\n\nFinished up at mid-day and tried to settle down to write some Letters, but the place was in such an uproar that it was impossible.\n","35":"\n\nWent down the Village and had my photo taken. Hope they turn out alright so that I can send one Home to M.S. Received Letter from Mother. \n\nBad news in Paper. Tidal Wave at Mackay, Queensland. Enormous damage.\n","36":"\n\nGot Letters from Stan Wright and Mrs Sam – also Photo of Illy’s group. As usual I turned out a dream. Hope to the Lord the Sutton Veny turn out alright. \n\nHad to turn out of my cubicle to make Room for a new Serg.\n","37":" \n\nMiserable, wet, day. There’s not much to write about in ones Diary. The Papers are all shrieking that we can \"never starve Germany\", and the war news is not too cheering.\n\nStan Wright said his Father mentioned us in his Letter and said he was pleased to hear of my \"narrow escape from death.\" Queer way to put it.\n\nWrote to Mother tonight, but news is scarce, and it’s hard to write a decent Letter. I must write to France tomorrow.\n","38":"\n\nBust day at the Mess, but things went off very well.\n\n \n \n","39":"\n\nBeards went away of Furlough today and Jem Cody returned. Toby gave me a hand in Bill’s place. Went to Concert at Y.M.C.A. \"Perham Stars\", the Camp Concert Party run by Lieut Shemallich. On my return I found a Letter from M.S. it was in answer to my first letter from Brighton.\n","40":"\n\nRotten day. Wind and Rain.

Lill’s Mother’s Birthday\n","41":"\n\nFinished work about 2. Toby, Bob and I walked into Warminster. It is not a bad little Town. It was full of soldiers. It is a very pleasant walk, about 3 miles from our Camp.\n\nA Lovely day, but wind a bit cool. Got back about 6 and had Tea. Then we wandered over to our Hut and had a yarn with the Fire Brigade Sergeant. He was at Serapeum and many other places in Egypt the same time as we were.\n\nI should have written some Letters today, but going into Warminster put me off.\n\nI’m getting my photos tomorrow from Reynolds. Hope they are alright, as they are very anxious to get one at Home. B.E. will be forgetting what I’m like.\n","42":"\n\nGlory Alleluia! 2 more Letters from B.E. and some snaps. I’ll have to get busy now and answer them. My day on. Was kept busy all day. Got my Photos from Reynolds. They are not much good. I wonder what Lill will think of ‘em.\n\nAfter Tea went to Concert at Y.M.C.A. 5th Pioneers. It was their first appearance and they did very well. The \"Anzac Coves\" are showing at the Court Theatre, London.\n","43":"\n\nSent photos to Lill.

To make matters more exciting the Painters are doing the place out and things are upside down.\n","47":"\n\nMrs Draper went away this morning. She gave me some candles before leaving, so I must be in her good books. Had a Bath in the afternoon.\n","48":" \n\nBeards and I are on all day. Our \"P.M.\" day we call it. Lovely day too. Just the sort of day to go for a Picnic with B.E. Got a Letter from Jacko. He informs me that Billy May got the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Good Luck to him.\n\nCommenced Letter No 8 to B.E. Funny thing, I was looking thro’ my diary this morning and find that I wrote last years No 8 on this date. \n\nA good number of the officers are away, so things are fairly quiet.\n","49":"\n\nAnother Glorious day.

Haven’t had a Letter from France for ages. Am beginning to wonder what’s wrong.\n\nThat delightful scrawl of B.E’s is conspicuous by its absence of late, too.

I’ll be mighty glad to get a Letter from B.E., as her Letters are always so cheerful and give a man a bit more interest in Life.\n\nFlanagan went away on Leave yesterday.\n","104":"\n\nWar news look a bit bright and this morning we are holding Fritz back, but the casualties on both sides must be enormous.\n\nGeorge Lawson, the Billiard marker, finished up at his job today, had a few words with the \"Food Controller\". He and I went into Warminster after Dinner. The Depot Band was playing at the Town Hall, and tho’ it was bitterly cold a good crowd gathered to listen to the Music. We had some Biscuits and Tea at the new \"Y.M.\" went for a stroll and had some more Tea and Sandwiches at the Town Hall.\n\nThen we went to the Methodist Church. It was quite homely and I enjoyed it much better than \"the Minster\" services.\n\nSun 14 (cont)\n\nAfter the Service we attended a Sing-Song in the School-Room. I met Sgt Matheson there.\n\nA number of Ladies were present and handed round Tea and Cakes.

A miserable day. Even Minnie feels it. The war news continues pretty good.\n\nWent up for classification before Maj. Mapletow, the S.M.O. He sounded me and said \"Carry on\" so I’m right for another week. \"Toby\" said he felt fit, and was marked A3, so he will soon be leaving us.\n\nLast Sat. the S.M.O. went to London to get his D.S.O. from the King.\n\nI wish the money would arrive from B.E, so that I could go on Leave. I didn’t draw any Pay last Friday, so that’s about 27\/- I am now to the good.\n\nFlanagan returned from leave.\n","107":"\n\nAnother cold, wet day.\n\nThe war news looks serious again this morning. Fritz has captured Messines Ridge and Baileul . The papers are quite confident that Fritz can’t win.\n\nGot Letter from Ruth. She informs me that France is engaged. Well, it’s about time something was doing. I’m sure I wish her the best of luck.\n\nGot Letter from Sam Ibbs, asking me if I can go on Leave with him on Thursday, but it’s out of the question.\n","108":" Apt. 18\n\nBusy day.

We Houp-lade and played darts and had a few little sips of Light refreshment. \n\nWarminster is quite lively on a Saturday night as most of the crowd from 1 C P and O T B get there.

Attended Morning Service at Sutton Veny Church. Bishop of Salisbury preached the Sermon.\n","112":"\n\nBeautiful day. Went on Parade, first time in 3 months.\n\nWent for slow walk with the Hut corporals and D.A.H.s. At night went to Warminster where I met \"Pig\" Johnson.

This is a very fine ward with about 30 Beds. The nurses are most pleasant. Food good and fairly plentiful. \n\nThere is a notice just outside the ward door which says in English and German \"The Sentry has orders to shoot any man crossing this wire\". It appears that some time ago this ward was occupied by German prisoners.\n\nWish I had a Pen so that I could write to B.E. She will wonder what the dickens has gone wrong.\n\nWrote Letter 18 to B.E.\n\nThe chap in the next Bed lent me his Pen, so now I can carry on the Good work.\n","119":"\n\nTwo doctors came and looked at us this morning and one of ‘em told me to knock off smoking.\n\nThe weather is keeping good. No bloomin’ mail for me yet. I can’t understand not getting any Letters. Haven’t had any news since","120":"\n","121":"\n\nOne chap in our ward was issued with Civilian clothes today. Every man in the ward looked on with eyes of envy.\n","122":"\n\nDay opened up fine, but rained towards evening.\n\nThey wake us up rather early in this ward. Make the Beds about 4, and bring water for washing about 4.30. Then they make the Beds. We breakfast about 7.30. About 9 the dope is given out. The doctor comes round about 10. Diner is at 12, and Tea about 4.30. \n\nDropped a few lines to Ruth today.\n","123":"\n\nThe doctor came round this morning and marked me for a Board. So now I must reat my soul in patience and wait for it to come off. Another M.O. came round after dinner and marked me Weymouth.\n","124":"\n\nThe doctors took about a quart of Fluid from one of our chaps this morning. He seems to be pretty bad.\n\nThe doctor says he will fill in my Board Papers tomorrow. I commenced Letter 18 to M.S. and told her all about it. Perhaps I was wrong in doing so, as I am a long way from Home yet, and she will be awfully disappointed if the Board happens to fail. Gee! but I hope not. The very idea of being \nHome\n again makes me feel about 10 years younger. Anyhow I’m going to hope for the Best.\n\nBill Beards and Mic Lean came to see me. They were going on Leave.\n\nNo mail for me yet.\n","125":"\n\nThe doctor said he would make out my Board papers today but he must have forgotten.\n\nGeorge Lawson came to see me and brought some Cigarettes.

Of course we said wib be delightful; and Eggs figured on our menu for Tea.\n\nWrote Letter 19. \n","126":"\n\nCorp. Carr came to see me today and promised to send some Jam and other good things.

He hails from Lancashire. Stands about 5 ft high, and is just as funny as he is short. He is away from Home for the first time in his Life and is always talking about \"house and mother\".\n\nCarr sent down some Biscuits and Cheese and Strawberry Jam and Butter and we had quite a Banquet for Tea.\n\nThere are a number of malaria cases her from Salonika, and tho’ \"heads\" seem puzzled to know what to do with ‘em.\n","128":"\n\nI thought Bill Beard would have been to see me today but he did not arrive. Carr came down from the Officer’s Mess, and brought a good supply of eatables with him, so we had quite a Banquet for Tea.\n","129":"\n\nThey are expecting the Chief Matron here tomorrow and they are flying round putting things straight.\n","130":"\n\nGeorge Lawson came in to see me after dinner and brought his Chess Board down. He gave me an idea how to play, but I am very thick headed and it takes me some time to pick anything up. The Chief Matron came round but did not visit our ward altho’ we were all dressed up for the occasion.\n\nAfter Tea Bill Donald and I had a few Games at Chess. He is just about as good a player as I am, and we had some exciting Finishes.\n","131":"\n\nGlory: Alleluia. Got a Big Mail this morning. 22 Letters, from Lill, Mother, France, Kath, Nell, and Aunt Nell. My head is still buzzing from reading them. \n\nThere were 6 Letters from Lill, but one of ‘em made me feel like a worm. I know I deserve it, so I can’t growl.

I wish they would make out my Board Papers and send me down there.

He came in after Tea and made out 3 chaps papers, but didn’t have time to do Donald’s and mine. We must hope for better Luck tomorrow.\n","135":"\n\nGot Letter from Aunt Alice at Southend. She was mighty interested in the news of Nell.\n\nDonald and I are getting quite enthusiastic Chess Players.\n\nThe Doctor did not make or Papers out.\n","136":"\n\nThe weather has been glorious this last few days.\n\nGot Letter from Mrs Samson this morning. She informs me that Sam is going to be made a Corporal. God Luck to him.\n\nThere is a rather chap in No 1 Command by name of \"Bomber Ball\". It appears that during the fighting at Bullecourt last May, his party captured a number of Germans, among them a Major. This Major stood on his ‘dig’ and said he would not go back to the cage without an escort of an officer of equal rank. \"Bomber\" quite equal to the occasion said \"Right O, you are reduced to the Ranks by Bomber Ball \"Quick March\".\n","137":"\n\nThe doctor came around this afternoon and made out Donald’s and my Papers, so that is one step forward anyhow. The doctor said I was sure to be sent Home as I would not be fit for at least a year. But of course the people at Weymouth have to say the Final word. We hear all sorts of rumours from there. Some say that it is very hard for a Heart case to get thro’, and others say it is just as easy.\n\n3 chaps from this ward are going down to Weymouth tomorrow. Had my Papers been made out I would most likely have been going down with them. I won’t be long tho’ now my papers are made out.\n","138":"\n\nBill Beards came to see me today and brought my Kit Bag. He has left the Officer’s Mess and awaiting a Board for Lung Trouble.\n\nWrote to Ern Harvey and Mrs Sam Ibbs. Must write Nell and Mother tomorrow.\n","139":"\n\nGlorious day. Big crowds passed the Hospital in Char-a-banc and all kinds of vehicles. Picnic parties, and all sorts.\n\nWe celebrated Whit Sunday by having Marmalade for Breakfast and Tea.\n\nWrote Letter 22 to M.S.\n","140":"\n\nWeather continues good.\n\nSutton Veny is quite lively today. Crowds of people about. \n\nBig Air Raid on London. Lots of damage done and many killed. Fritz is a lonf time commencing the offensive.\n","141":"\n\nHeard today that the two chaps who went from here to Weymouth both passed the Board alright. I shall be glad to get down there and get my Board over. Expect to go down this weekend.\n","142":"\n\nI’m hanged if I can settle down to write any Letters. Yesterday I wrote to the Paymaster at Command Depot to enquire about my application to G.O.C. for a withdrawal.\n\nIt’s about time I heard from the Bank about Lill’s cable.\n","143":"\n\nGot cheque from Bank. \"Ooray. Good old Lill. That’s the beauty of having an ideal wife.\n\nIt couldn’t have arrived at a Better Time. Now if only the Board at Weymouth do the right thing \"everything in the Garden will be lovely\". Wrote to Nell.\n","144":" Empire Day.\n\nAfter dinner got my khaki from Q.M. store and went down to No 1 Command. Cashed Lill’s Fiver. Called in Mess and saw Flanagan and the rest of ‘em.\n\nAfter Tea went with Brett and had a good Feed of Eggs.\n","145":"\n\nParaded to orderly room with my kit, and was informed that I was in charge of the party for Weymouth, 8 men and myself. We went to Warminster station in a motor-bus. Left there at 10.58 and went as far as Westbury. Here we had to change trains. We got some refreshments on the station, which were very welcome as we had to wait an hour for a train. Arrived in Weymouth about 2.15. A no. of us went to Westham Camp by motor, the remainder had to walk. I rode. Here our particulars were taken and we were told off to Huts.\n\nSun. May 26. \n\nWeather simply glorious.\n\nWent up for classification and get marked B2A. it was a great disappointment in a way, but its some little satisfaction to know that I’m not quite so bad as the Tommy doctor said.\n\n3 of my party got sent to Hospital and all the rest got B2B or C class. They are all on the Boat Roll. Lucky beggars. Poor old Lill, I’m more than sorry I said anything about coming Home, as I know the poor old kid will be mighty disappointed. I was beginning to wonder what it would feel like to be walking down the gangway and meeting old B.E. But now that dream is shattered.\n","146":"\n\nThe \"Kyarm\" who is now D 10 was torpedoed near Swanwich this weekend. Luckily she only had her staff aboard. Five of the crew were killed by the explosion. The chaps who were on the Roll were to have left here to go aboard on Sunday morning; they had their tickets and everything ready of course they are not \"going sore\" at all.\n\nSun May 26th (cont)\n\nAfter dinner a number of us went into Weymouth. It is about a mile from the Camp and quite a pleasant walk.\n\nWeymouth is a very nice town and has a good promenade. The weather is glorious and the town is thronged with visitors. The prom presents a gay sight at night, when the soldiers get away from their Camps, then the sombre hued khaki mixed with the gay summer dresses of the Fair Sex, with the sea for a background makes quite a good picture.\n\nI met Joe Bolger. He was looking in the park. Is up at Monte Video Camp, where he tells me Shag Shearer and Wally Clarke are also. Had Tea at Y.M. and returned home to Camp about 9. \n","147":"\n\nYesterday they moved us out of the Huts into Tents. It is much more pleasant but we have to walk a deuce of a way for a wash and for meals. The food is pretty light, but what we do get is good. I was put on a Fatigue Party pitching Tents, and it quite knocked me out. \n\nAfter Tea went into Weymouth again and met some of the crowd. That money old B.E. sent me could not have arrived at a better time. It is better down here than it would be in London. Went back to Camp about 8 and com. Left No 23. \n","148":"\n\nGlory: Alleluia. Got some more mail today. 3 letters from Lill and 1 from Mother. Everything going good.\n\nWas up before the S.M.O. today but he left me on the old mark B2A. I may as well give up any hope of getting Home now. Finished Letter 23. \n\nWed 29\n\nIt’s pretty solid here putting a man on Fatigue Party’s after having been confined to Bed for a month. My opinion of the Aust Med Service has fallen very much during the last few months. One quack puts you down for one thing and another one for another. Anyhow it’s nice to know that I’m going to improve. I wouldn’t like to think I was going to be an invalid.\n","149":" (cont)\n\nWas told off to report to Board Room for my Final Board at 10.45, but after fooling around till about 3.30, they said I would not be wanted till Friday. I’ll be glad to get it over and end the suspense.\n","150":"\n\nThings about the same. Most of the chaps I came down here with are on Boat Rolls. The weather is keeping glorious. There are plenty of Yankee sailors about the Town and they are a very likely looking crowd. \n\nThe war news is not looking very cheerful. Fritz is advancing rapidly on Paris.\n","151":"\n\nFinal Board\n\nToday I went for my Final Board. I had a good go at my Faithful Briar and when I went before the Major the D.A. was very pronounced. He gave me a good overhauling and said to the clerk \"As marked\" so that meant B 2A. Oh well, now that is over I can write and tell poor old B.E. about it.\n\nI wonder what they will do with me now.\n\nQuite a number of chaps got marked A class, so I did at least do a bit better than them. \n","152":"\n\nGee: I’m getting quite a lot of mail lately. Today got 2 Letters from France, one of ‘em containing a Pound note for a Birthday present. Poor Kid, I’m mighty sorry she has been sent to Salonika. It’s not too pleasant by all accounts.\n\nShe also enclosed a snap of herself and am glad to see her looking so well. Got letter from Eric Herford. I really ought to write some Letters, but I’m hanged if I can settle down to do anything in this place. Something in the sea side air makes me very restless.\n","153":"\n\nHad a most refreshing Bath this morning and managed to dodge any Job. Went into town after dinner. Met \"Louise\" and a few more of the chaps who came with me from Sutton Veny. We strolled along the prom for a while, then adjourned to the Y.M. for Tea. The weather is simply glorious and it’s a treat to be alive.\n","154":" Tues. Wed. 3 4 ","155":"\n\nThings are just about the same. On Monday it rained for a while but it is quite fine again now.\n","156":" Wrote Letter No 24 to M.S.\n","157":" Presented Medal.\n\nThis morning about 200 men marched from Westham Camp into Weymouth and formed into a square round the King George Statue on the front. It was a beautiful day and quite a big crowd had gathered to see the fun. The Dorset Reg was there with their Band. There were about a dozen men decorated – 2 D.C.M.s, about 8 M.M.s, and 2 long service medals. Gen Schlater presented the medals. Some Staff Officers, smothered in red bands and gold braid, read out what each man got his award for. I was jolly glad when it was all over. Corp Street got the D.C.M. He won it at Fromelles in 1916 so it’s been a long time coming.\n","158":" (cont)\n\nAfter Tea Tamblyn and I went to a whist drive at Arcadia. It is a very pleasant little Hall. There is a good dancing floor, and dances are held here during the week. As soon as we entered the Building some Lady (aged) asked me if I would be her partner, to which I acquiesced. She was a very good player, but we held rotten cards and did not manage to get a prize.\n\nAfter the show my partner asked me if I would care to have a cup of coffee before I went back to Camp. I said I would and she took me Home and gave me two cups of coffee and some Bread and \nreal\n butter and cheese. It doesn’t do to say \"No\" to a Feed nowadays.\n","159":"\n\nToday we got a weekly pass from the D.O.R. for working at the Y.M.C.A. We are still rolling the floor, which is good exercise. At night \"Tam\" and I went to another whist drive. Just a quite affair – mostly old maids attend. I was strolling quietly home to Camp when I met the A.P.M.and his posse of \"Jacks\". He pulled me up and asked to see my pass. I got quite a shock when he said it was twenty to twelve. They took my pass, also my name and number and told me to report myself under open arrest as soon as I arrived back in Camp. Some old \"Romeo\" was warbling \"When you come to the end of a Perfect day\" in a house near the camp. It appealed to me.\n","160":"\n\nMy Birthday. This is the 4th I have spent as a member of the A.I.F. and I don’t care how soon I spend one as a member of the R.S.A. Col. Astbury and I celebrated it by drinking two of the best in the Canteen. I wonder if B.E. is thinking of me today.\n\nAbout mid-day \"Tam\" and I knocked off at the Y.M. and went in for a cup of coffee. One of the other chaps came in and said that \"Mr Opie, the Y.M. boss\" wanted to pay us. It was quite a surprise as we didn’t expect it. Anyhow we drew 5 bob, and very handy it was too. At night we went into Town and visited the market where things can be bought very cheap. \nGot 2 glorious long Letters from M.S.\n \n","161":"\n\nBeautiful weather.\n\nTam and I went into Town after dinner and strolled along the Prom. We went into the \"Popular Tea rooms\" where we had Ham and Eggs, B and B’ter and Tea; followed by custard Jelly and cakes. A good variety, but I was far from full when I left. Went back to Camp about 8.30 and com. Letter No 26 to M.S.\n","162":"\n\nIt’s marvellous the fellows one meets in this place. Today I met Jack Edgar and Bert Pryor. Charley Bowler is also with them. They have been sent over from France as P.U. \n\nFinished Letter 26. I hardly know what to say about Lill’s coming to England. It would be glorious to have her here, but when one thinks of the Food Shortage and Air Raids, and the risks she would run coming over, it makes one think. Anyhow, I’ll wait and see what her next Letter says and see if Nell has anything to say about it, then I’ll cable.\n","163":"\n","164":"\n\nTamblyn went away today on the Munition Stunt, and I feel quite lost without him. He was a very decent chap.\n","165":"\n\nWent to Whist Drive again at \"Arcadia\". Saw \"the Duchess\" in wait, so I asked the first Lady I me to be my partner. We were just settling down to play when a big husky blue-jacket arrived. My partner rushed up to him. Presently she returned to me and said \"Do you mind if I don’t play with you tonight. My friend has arrived and I didn’t think he was coming ashore tonight\", And will you play with Aunty. Of course I smiled, and acquiesced. Aunty was a dear old soul of about 80 summers, but my word she could play Whist.\n\nThe younger damsel was rather charming, and I’m sure Lill would have patted me on the back for changing over with such good grace.\n","166":"\n\nStill pottering around at the Y.M. We are waiting for the stuff to come along so we can finish the floor off.\n","167":"\n\nCol and I and Perce Taylor went to a Dance at \"Arcadia\". It is a very nice Hall and a good floor. The music was very nice, too. I was not game to get up for the first few dances, as it was so long since I danced, but eventually I plucked up courage, and once I got going I was alright. Had a couple of dances with a Land Girl. She could dance, too, despite the fact that she wore breeches and leggings.\n","168":"\n\nWoke up this morning feeling very dry in the throat and a nasty headache, but took no notice. After dinner went to see Col but he was in Bed, and said he felt very sick. I was feeling very rotten too, so instead of going into Town I went back to my Tent and turned into my Blankets.\n\nIt must be this Spanish Influenza we are getting. During the morning I wrote to Mother.\n","169":"\n\nOh dear, I feel nearly dead this morning. My head is splitting and I ache all over. Got some quinine today, but it didn’t seem to do much good. Felt too bad to go to work at Y.M. Crawled up to see Col, but he is very sick too.\n","170":"\n\nWent on sick parade this morning. There was a good muster and most of ‘em were suffering from this rotten dog’s disease. I was just 100°. The doctor marked me for more Quinine, but I haven’t much faith in it. It’s alright as a preventative against cold or Fever, but once you have the complaint I don’t think Quin does much good.\n\nI was going to write such a lonf letter to Lill on Sunday but I feel too bloomin’ ill to do anything; so M.S. must please excuse me. I stayed in my Tent all day, being too sick to move. After Tea I commenced Letter to M.S. 27\/\n\nWed June 26th - The Day\n\nThis is the 3rd Anniversary of the wonderful","171":" It is a glorious day, just such a one as it was in 1915. \n\nI hopped out of my blankets bright and early this morning, feeling almost well again. The Day must have cured me. Went down to Y.M., but there was nothing doing. \n\nGot word to proceed into Weymouth and see Eye-Specialist at Red Barracks. He was a civilian and very nice old chap he was too. It was quite a treat to be spoken to like a man, instead of getting your head snapped off, as our M.O.’s do. He said my eyesight was not bad, but that I ought to wear glasses. He gave me a prescription and said that they would let me know when the \"specs\" were ready.\n\nAfter leaving Red Barracks I took a stroll along the Prom and arrived back in Camp just too late for dinner. \n\nI wonder if M.S. is thinking of me today. Why of course she is. I wrote a \ngood long Letter. No 27\n,\n\nAfter Tea I managed to get back to Town where I had a Feed of Chips, Fish was \"off\". As I was crossing the Bridge on my way back to Camp I passed a very prepossessing damsel who gave me the \"Glad eye\". I was about to respond – but checked myself. Well, I’ve been good so far, I must keep it up now.\n\nAnd I turned into my Blankets about 10 feeling very lonely and longing for a pair of dimpled arms around my neck again.\n","172":"\n\nWent to Whist drive with Col. The Com’t is down with Flu and so are a number of other officers. There was a nice little crowd at the Drive and it was quite enjoyable.\n","173":"\n\nI feel quite lost now not being at the Y.M. I’ll miss my pay this week too.\n\nGot 2 Letters from France today, one containing snapshots. Both of ‘em were in an awful state. On them was pasted a typed slip \"Damaged by Sea water thro’ enemy action\". I could just make out the writing and the pictures and that was all.\n","174":"\n\nWeather continues glorious. After Tea Col and I went down to the Fete in a Paddock behind Greenhill Gardens. It was rather quite, so we went to the Pavilion to see \"Broadway Jones\", which was very amusing. On our way back to Camp we managed to get some chipped Potatoes; which made quite a good Supper.\n","175":"\n\nHad a Bath and donned clean change. Wrote to France. About 3 went into Town. Being such a beautiful day there were plenty of people about. Met a Cpl I knew and we adjourned to the Y.M. for Tea.\n\nAbout 6 met a chap I knew who comes from Yeoval-Josephine. We went for a walk and had a good old yarn. Unfortunately, he goes away tomorrow. A friend of the \"duchess\", Tamlyn’s pal.\n","176":"\n\nGot a pleasant surprise this morning when I went down to the Y.M. to see my name on the Motor School List. The new school is not finished yet, so we are still carrying on at the Cinema. During the morning we had a Lecture, on the motor engine, and from 11 to 12, and about 1.45 to 4 pm we dis-sembled and assembled different parts of a motor. \n\nWent into Town after Tea but did not stay long. Met Perce Taylor and we went and had a feed of chips.\n\nFinished Letter No 28 to B.E.\n","177":"\n\nWent into Eye Specialist again ay Weymouth, and got issued with a pair of Glasses. Attended Lecture before I went, on \"Timing the Valves\". I’m very glad I didn’t miss it, as it is a very particular item. Stayed in Camp at night. Had Supper at Canteen – Fish and Chips.\n","178":"\n\nThe Lecture this morning was \"Cooling and Lubrication\". After that we had a good go at timing the valves, and I do believe that my dense brain has almost grasped the idea.\n\nStayed in Camp and did some washing. A lovely job, I don’t think.\n","179":"\n\nThis morning being Independence Day, the Stars and Stripes floated alongside our Flag. All the companies paraded on the main Parade Ground.\n\nThe Lecture at Motor School was on \"Carburettors\". \n\nIt was Open Camp from 1 o’clock, so we did nothing after dinner. There are a great many visitors in Weymouth now, and the Front is quite gay and animated. Went into Town after Tea and met Col. Spent the evening quietly.\n","180":"\n\nGlory: Alleluia. Got some mail this morning. 3 Letters from B.E., 2 from Mother, and 1 from Ruth. Everything is alright, thank the Lord. B.E.’s Letters are simply glorious, they are the most precious things I get nowadays.\n\nSat Fri July 5\n\nAfter Tea went to see Mr Opie about B.E.’s proposed coming to England and he gave me some sound advice. He said not to dream to her coming as it would be such a serious matter to get her back. He also told me something else, but it won’t do to write it down.\n\nDouglas and I and Mr Kingsbury finished laying the floor in the Motor School. We worked till late, and had our Tea at the Y.M. About the best Feed I’ve had since being in Blighty. Did not go into Town as was too tired.\n","181":"\n\nThere was a presentation of medals today at Monte Video. They tried to drag the Motor School into it, but with the aid of the Serg. M.T. we managed to evade it.\n\nDouglas and I finished rolling the Floor and covered it with sand. Was very much surprised when Mr Opie came along and paid us the usual 5\/-, I didn’t expect it.\n\nDoug and I went back after dinner and worked for an hour or so. Went into Town after Tea. It was quite gay-looking. Flags were flying everywhere. It was the King and Queen’s Silver Wedding Day.\n","182":"\n\nThe weather continues glorious. It is about the finest spell of good weather I remember in England. Had a Bath after Break and donned clean change.\n\nWrote Mother during morning. After dinner wrote B.E. and told her what Mr Opie said about coming over here. Had Tea at Y.M. in Weymouth.\n","183":"\n\nBrought all the gear over from the Cinema to the new motor school. The floor is set fairly well. We were on Parade till about 10.45, so there was not much done before dinner. The Lecture had to be \"cut-out\".\n\nI gave Mr O.P. the particulars he asked for and now I am anxiously awaiting developments.\n","184":"\n\nMany Happy returns Mother\n.\n\nGlorious day. Our floor in the Motor School is getting badly cut up.\n\nLecture on \"Magnet\". Very interesting. The Orderly Room continues to annoy us. If only they would leave us alone we could learn something at the school, but mostly our time is wasted on Parades. After Tea went into Town.\n","185":"\n\nThe Lecture on \"The Magneto\" was continued this morning.\n\nWent into Town after Tea with \"Perce\". It came on to rain, so we took shelter in a Bathing Tent. About 10 we looked into \"Arcadia\" where the usual Wed. night dance was on and I had the last waltz before going back to Camp.\n","186":"\n\nMany happy returns B.E.\n Hope to the Lord I’m Home before her next.\n\nThe School Lecture was on Electricity Accumulators, etc. Dave and I and a couple of others are putting an engine together. It’s very interesting but we waste a lot of time looking for the different parts. We fixed an oil engine to our car, so as to see the working of the Gears.\n\nWrote Letter No 30 to B.E.\n","187":"\n\nLecture on Clutch and Gear Box. I take down copious notes on the Lectures, but I’m hanged if I can understand what I’ve written at times.\n\nIt is raining beautifully, and the Farmers are smiling once more. I did not go into Town after Tea, but stayed in Camp and looked over my gear. It’s a week today since I had that yarn with O.P. and I’m beginning to wonder if anything will come of it.\n","188":"\n\nLecture on Springs, Tyres, etc.\n\nAfter Tea I went into Town but things were rather quiet. I’ve seen scores of chaps here that I know.\n","189":"\n\nRaining again. Wrote to France during the morning, must write Mother tomorrow. After dinner had a good read of \"Motor Manual\" and about 4 went into Town. Had Tea at Soldier’s Club, and went to Pictures in Jubilee Hall. They were very good and the music was fine.\n","190":"\n\nMore Rain. At Motor School we started over the Lectures again and had a little talk about I.C. Engines. Saw Mr O.P. during the day and he says that things are going good. When I sit and think that there’s a chance of getting back to B.E. again, it seems almost too wonderful a thing to happen.\n\nAt night attended Recital in Y.M. which was very good.\n","191":"\n\nHeard this morning that the D 17 was torpedoed and the crowd who were going Home on her are returning to Camp. I believe she was the \"Ceramic\", if so that’s another big boat gone under. \n\nFritz has started another offensive, but he doesn’t seem to be doing much good. The Yanks are in the mix-up.\n\nAfter Tea Perce Taylor and I went out to a place along the Prom. The invitation came thro’ the Y.M.C.A. When we arrived we found five more of our chaps there and the two parson daughters completed the party. It is a pleasantly situated House overlooking the Prom. We had a few songs, played a few Games, then had Coffee and Cakes. Finished up by singing a hymn. It was a very pleasant evening.\n\nWe saw the return of a Train load of the torpedoed party and they did look characters.\n","192":"\n\nThis time last year we were at Senlis, preparing for a Concert.\n\nThe fellows who were on the D 16 and got torpedoed are getting around the Camp in all kinds of rig-outs. Some of them have some startling tales to tell.\n\nAt the Motor School we had a Lecture on Cooling and Lubricating. Most of the School are in 47 Hut and we have some great old arguments at times. It rained all day. \n\nThere was a Thanksgiving Service at the Y.M.C.A. for the Safe return of the men.\n\nWrote Mother:\n\nGee: I must write Nell tomorrow.\n","193":"\n\nMore rain, Saw Jack Edgar, Charley Bowler, and Claude Dundes tonight. They are all on the Boat Roll. Lucky beggars. I’m beginning to wonder if anything is going to come of Mr O.P.’s promise.\n\nWent into Town after Tea, but things are very quiet.\n","194":"\n\nSecond anniversary of the Battle of Fromelles. My first time in action and a lively time it was too.\n\nIt poured in rain all day.\n\nThe war news is good. The French have driven Fritz back 4 miles on a 25 mile front and taken 20,000 prisoners. Hooray.\n\nWrote to Nell.\n","195":"\n\nWent to dance at Arcadia. There was a good crowd there and we had an enjoyable time. I only missed 3 dances.\n","196":"\n\nMore Rain. The War news continues good, and Fritz is being kept \"on the move\".\n\nThe Yanks are \"well in\" it now and doing good work.\n\nFinished Letter 31 to M.S.\n","197":"\n\nStill raining. Lecture on \"Electricity\". Most interesting.\n\nAttended Concert at Y.M. Miss Cooper’s Party. Very Good.\n","198":" - PARCEL from Mother\n\nThe rain cleared away after dinner, and it was quite fine again. Got a Letter from Lill and 1 from Mrs Ibbs and a big, fat parcel from Mother, which was mighty welcome.\n\nManaged to get my boots changed at the Q.M. Store, a thing I’ve been trying to do for weeks. Was warned to parade at Medical Hut at 2 oclock. Thought I was up for another Board, but it turned out to be nothing more than to sign my last Board Papers.\n\nAfter Tea, Doug and I went to Mrs Lancaster’s and spent a pleasant couple of hours. It was a glorious moonlight night and we strolled along the front till about 10.30.\n\nAlright, Mrs A.J. I’m a flat, am I. Right O, I’ll pay you back for that when I come Home.\n","199":"\n\nPouring rain again. Went on clothing parade and changed my Boots.\n\nThere are 36 attending the Motor School now, which in my opinion, is far too many. We are falling over each other.\n\nThe parcel I received from Mother yesterday was jolly welcome, and contained sugar and cake, and various other things which are jolly hard to get nowadays.\n","200":" \n\nIt rained on St Swithins’ day, and it has poured ever since. It’s a wonder they don’t strike Swithin off the Saint list.\n\nWrote Mother. After Tea Perc Taylor and I went into Town. Met Ted Sutton on the Prom. He is down with Papers from H.Q. He works in the office where they fix up the Boat Rolls, and promises to keep his eyes open for my papers. So, B.E., I really ought to get Home one of these days.\n","201":"\n\nFine day. Procession of W.A.A.C’s thro’ the town and very well they looked.\n","202":"\n\nMet Bill Western in town and had a good old yarn. He is stationed down here so we shall see more of each other. There are plenty of visitors and the town is quite lively. Gee: I forget to tell Ted Sutton about my other Board Papers. Must drop him a line to Horseferry Road.\n","203":"\n\nThis time last year I arrived at Rouen. Little did I think I would be in Blighty for so long then. This is our last week at the Motor School. Douglas Duncan, the \"Wool Classer\" and I had half an hours tuition from Peter, in driving. I did fairly well, but might have done better.\n","204":"\n\nThe car in which we were learning to drive id broken down, so it looks as tho’ we have finished driving Lessons. I’ve heard no more about getting on a Boat Roll and I’m afraid my chances are very poor.\n","205":"\n\nThe weather is very unsettled, and the Holiday makers are having a bad time. There are about 40 attending the Motor School now, and it is simply a scramble to get hold of any tools.\n","206":"\n\nAnother month gone, and I seem as far away from a Boat Roll as ever. The war news is good and Fritz is falling back all along the line.\n","207":"\n\nWent into Y.M.C.A. and sat for Exam to see how much we had learnt about motor engines. We had to answer 26 out of 30 questions. Most of us managed to get thro’ them.\n\nPeter took a photo of us in the Motor School.\n","208":"\n\nThe result of the Exam came out today and I was 3rd on the List with 95 marks. Harling was first And Cpl Gordon second. We are finished up now at the Motor School so we are expecting to be grabbed for a Job.\n","209":" Anniversary Day\n\nThis is the Fourth Anniversary of the War, and certainly it is the most cheerful one. The War news never looked better. There are Special Services being held in all the Churches. Crowds of visitors came to Town last night and the Beach and prom are simply crowded.\n\nComm Letter 33 to B.E.\n","210":"\n\nThere is a rumour going round the Camp that D17 had been sunk, but there id nothing official. Finished Letter 33 to M.S. and wrote to Arthur.\n\nWent to a dance in \"Arcadia\". It was a Long Night, from 8 till 12, but we had to \"clear out\" at 11. There was a jolly nice crowd there, and one couldn’t help having a good time.\n","211":"\n\nOh Lord: What a thud.\n\nAll the B2A’s had to go on a special Parade this morning. There were about 30 of us and some staff officer picked out 10 of us to go on Postal duty to France. I don’t know what B.E. will say about it. They say we are going to Le Havre, but I don’t think anyone is sure about it. Col. Astbury has been away on Leave for 4 days, but is expected back tonight. Went into Town for a stroll but came back early.\n","212":"\n\nFossicked around all day trying to get news about this Postal Job, but no one seems to know anything about it or when we are likely to be going. Met Bill Western in Town, and we went for a stroll along the Beach and saw the fishermen putting out their nets.\n","213":"\n\nWent into Town for a walk. The weather is keeping splendid and so is the war news.\n","214":"\n\nThere’s no news about the Postal Job, but I’ve got my things ready for a move. Commenced Letter 34 to B.E. I wonder what she will think of things. It’s certainly a mess-up.\n","215":"\n\nGot word this morning to pack up and be ready to move off. Got my boots from the Bootmaker and drew rations for the Journey. Said \"Goodbye\" to the mob.\n\nLeft Weymouth about 11, changed at Westbury and reached Warminster about 3. 4 mile march to O.T.B. Had a jolly good tea, Bread and Butter and Jam and Lettuce. Best Feed I’ve had for months. Attended Concert in Y.M. Very Good.\n","216":" At O.T.B.\n\nFinished Letter 34 to M.S.\n\nShall be jolly glad to get over to France and on to our Job. This messing about in Camp would drive a man to drink. Went to Picture Show after Tea. Best 3d of pictures I ever had. Saw Enid Bennett in \" Little Brother\".\n","217":"\n\nStill bumming around the Camp. One good thing a man gets plenty of tucker, so things are not too bad.\n\nTues 13\n\nWas issued with gear at Q.M.S. They wanted to put","218":" down in my Pay Book for a Waterproof Cape they had not credited me with at Weymouth, but I wasn’t having any. \n\nThey sent us out on a Job, but every man bucked against it, and we got off. Shall ne mighty glad to get settled down on our Job, as it’s a bloomin’ nuisance this messing around.\n","219":"\n\nPoor old B.E. will get a shock when she knows I’m going back to France. Shall be jolly glad to get some mail to know how things are going at Glebe Point.\n\nWe \"fell in\" about 7 and marched to Warminster station. At least the others did, but I got a lift in a motor lorry with all the birds out of \"clink\". They were a bright crowd. There were about 500 men in the draft, and there was a big crowd at the station to see us off.\n","220":"\n\nBoarded Train and left Warminster about 10.30 last night, arrived Shorncliffe about 4 am, marched from there to Rest Camp; which is a number of big boarding Houses which have been taken over by the Govt. We had a wash and Breakfast and went aboard the Boar about 10.30 am.\n\nThur Aug 15 (cont)\n\nCame over on L.N.W. Boat \"Margaret\", arrived Boulogne about 2 pm. This meant we were back in France once more. We came ashore and marched up the Famous \"One Blanket Hill\" to the Rest Camp, arriving there about 4 pm. After Tea and a wash, a number of us strolled into Town; but Funds being low there wasn’t much doing and we soon returned and went to Bunk.\n","221":"\n\nLeft Blanket Hill and marched to station, boarded Train about 10 and came on to Le Havre, arriving here about 11 pm; at Harfleur station. Marched from there to Camp, arriving about 1.30. We were soon between the Blankets as it had been a very tiring day.\n","222":"\n\nFood is good and plentiful in this Camp. After Tea wrote to Lill. Went to Pictures at Y.M., and Concert afterwards, both very good.\n","223":"\n\nWe are camped with the 3rd Div. The W.O. (Whitelaw) of the Post Office is in charge of us. We are not called on to do any Fatigues. The weather is very hot. After Tea Woodstock and I went for a stroll towards Le Havre but the M.P.’s turned us back before we got very far. There is some very pretty country around here.\n","224":"\n\nGee! talk about being hot, it’s as hot here as it was up amongst the Sugar in Queensland. The sweat pours off one as one is eating one’s meals. \n\nI wonder what B.E. will say when she hears I am back in France. Poor old Girl, that dear white forehead will be getting wrinkled over me.\n\nAfter Dinner Saunders and I got Leave to Havre. It is a twopenny trip on the tram. We had Tea at a Yankee Y.M. which was a fine place. 2 eggs, Bread and Butter, Tea and Custard and Prunes for about 1½ francs. We had a pretty good time. Met Bill Watson who used to work at Ma Kings.\n","225":"\n\nI left my diary behind at O.T.B. and this morning was pleasantly surprised to find that the Hut Orderly had sent it on to me. It was jolly decent of him, and I must write and thank him.\n\nAfter Tea Murrell and I walked into Le Havre. We paid a penny and went for a trip in a car down a hill, instead of walking down about a thousand steps. It was certainly a penny well spent. We met a Canadian on our way in who knew his way about, so he made a good travelling companion.\n","226":"\n\nStill very hot. We got orders to move down the Line today, but it was cancelled. Murrell and I walked into a village about 3½ miles away from Camp. There is a beautiful big park there, which was full of kids, and they quickly surrounded us with requests for souvenirs and \"Un son Messieurs\". \n","227":"\n\nYesterday we got a Cigarette issue. 4 pkts Cigs, 1 pkt Tobacco and 2 Boxes matches. Not bad for one week’s issue. The Food is pretty good here. For dinner today we had Meat Pie and Rice Pudding which went down well. After Tea Murrell and I went into the village for a stroll.\n","228":"\n\nWell there are no news of our moving yet, so they can’t be too badly in need of us. Was having a wash this morning when I hear somebody say \"Hello, Jack Moore\". I looked round and discovered it to be Bert Phegan. He is marked unfit for the Line, belongs to the 24th Batt. They are expecting another draft in today which will just about fill the Camp up. The news from the front continues good.\n","229":"\n\nLoafed around Camp, did some washing. After Tea Harling and I went to the Picture Show at the Y.M. and the Display by a Team of Gymnasts, both of which were very good.\n","230":"\n\nWarned to be ready to leave Camp with a draft. We fell in at 2.15, just too late to get any of the Comfort Fund Cigarettes. Marched to Le Havre Station. On our way in, our party (about 40 strong, B1 and Postal) halted for a spell in a quiet street. A French officer accompanied by a Lady and a little Girl, pulled up near us. The officer got out of the Car and went into a House. Then the little Girl came along, and in a very nice manner shook hands with every man in the Party, including the officer. It was quite a pleasant little episode, and she was a very sweet piccaninny. \n\nWe were issued with Rations, and stacked in cattle trucks \"36-40 Hommes or 8 cheval\". We got aboard the trucks about 5.30, but did not leave Le Havre station till 8. The floor was covered with about an inch of cement, and we were packed like sardines. Whenever anyone moved, the cement flew about and started us all sneezing.\n","231":"\n\nManaged to get a few mins broken sleep last night, but woke up this morning feeling very stiff and sore.\n\nOur train was not an express by any means, and we were quite surprised to reach Amiens about 9.30. Fritz certainly has made a mess of the city and its surroundings but what struck me as very remarkable, he does not appear to have smashed any Bridges. Poor old Amiens, it quite upset me to see it knocked about so badly, as I spent many pleasant hours there.\n\nWe reached Corbie about 11, and here we disembarked. The Town is in ruins, ans everywhere we saw signs of the recent\n\nheavy fighting in the Hun’s mad endeavour to reach Amiens. Trenches and wire entanglements were everywhere. \n\nWe marched into Town and were told off to billet in various houses. We, of the Postal Corps, have a Cottage to ourselves. 2 rooms are intact, but the rest of it is badly knocked about. We \"set to\" and soon made it fairly comfortable. In the kitchen is an enlarged portrait of a smiling little Girl, and lying about the house and yard are several playthings. This kind of thing upsets a man more than any of the front line happenings.\n\nThe stove is in good working order and we heated pork and beans, and made Tea on it. We got word tonight to report to the P.O. H.Q. tomorrow when we shall be told off what our Jobs are to be. Gee: B.E. – I do long for you tonight.\n","232":"\n\nLast night Harling and I intended to see \"the Coo-ees\" Concert Party, but when we arrived at the Hall the \"House Full\" notice was displayed, so we were disappointed.\n\nThis morning I woke up with fearful pains in the stomach, and went outside, where I had a fit if vomiting and diarrhoea. Gee: it was lively. The pains got worse, so Bert Phegan went round for a 3rd Div A.M.C. chap, who gave me some kind of dope, but it had no effect. As I showed no signs of improvement he got permission from the H.Q. Adj to send me to the 2nd F. Amb in a car. Here I was seen by \"M.G. Sutton, Maj\" who told me to get between the Blankets, where they administered into me 1½ ozs Ol Ricini . This very soon had the desired effect and I was \"kept moving\" all aft. and night. I put \"my funny feeling\" down to some rather doubtful salmon I ate for dinner yesterday.\n\nThe rest of the Postal Party went up near Amiens.\n","233":"\n\nHad to hop out a few times during the night, but feel a bit easier this morning. Considering we are so near the Line things are very quiet. There are scores of ‘planes about. The Gassed Patients all pass thro’ here, and there are a few \"casuals\" like myself. I am on \"Light diet\" chiefly rice puddings, a thing I don’t like too well.\n\nLater. The Guns are roaring away, and the sky is black with \"planes\". Evidently there is something doing. A day seems like a week here, and I hope to get away tomorrow.\n\nSaw \"Snowy\" Hargraves today, and we had quite a yarn about the 8th. He tells me George Hill was killed a few days ago, and says I wouldn’t recognise the old unit know.\n","234":"\n\nThe name of the Hospital \"Hospice Fouilloy\", and judging by its appearance it was some kind of Hospital before the War. Last night a big number of Tanks went up the Line, so Fritz is in for a merry time.\n\nI could have spent another couple of days in Hospital, but it was so deadly that I came away this morning and reported to W.O. Spriggins at Rail Head Corbie P.O. Here I saw Harling, who was doing the booking. He made me some Tea which was mighty welcome. About mid-day, after a feed of Roast Beef and Bread and Butter, I came along with the mail van, and reported for duty with 11th Brig. H.Q. P.O. Corp Flanagan is in charge. There are 3 chaps in the P.O. and I make 4. \n\nThe name of this village is Etenhens. We passed thro’ several other villages, all of which are in a terribly battered condition. Fritz is still being kept on the move, and our chaps are chasing him up. \n\nThe weather is glorious, nice sunshine and blue sky. The F.P.O. is situated in the only Farm Building that is intact; and this has only 3 walls left standing.\n\nHad a good Tea of Stew and B and B, and turned into Bunk with a heap of mail bags.\n","235":"\n\nFritz continues to fall back. We are expecting to move up nearer the Line at any time. Had Breakfast with the \"Pierrots\" (the 11th Brig. Con. Inf) who are billeted near us. Things are very quiet. We seem to be about the only ones left in the village. The guns must be a long way forward, as we can barely hear them.\n\nWeather glorious. Yesterday I sent my address up to W.O. Whitelaw, so should get some mail very soon. Gee: it will be great to get news of B.E. again and see those snaps. We live pretty well. Porridge and Bacon and Bread, Butter, Ham for Break. Not Bad.\n","236":"\n\nLast night Fritz came over and dropped a few Bombs around us and swept the Road with his machine Guns. I did not sleep too well. They say our chaps have surrounded Peronne and Bapaume. The weather is a bit dull this morning and it is drizzling with rain.\n","237":"\n\nWe moved nearer the Line today. Fritz puts plenty of shells around and makes things very lively. We passed thro’ \nSuzanne\n where the 3rd Div H.Q. are. Fritz must have made up his mind to stay here for the Winter, as there are some very snug little buildings and dugouts about that he had erected. On some of ‘em the tools are lying about, so it looks as tho’ our advances was very much of a surprise to him. Near our F.P.O. is a Hospital, that he had nearly finished. It was very comfortable. In fact some of the officer’s quarters were almost luxurious. There is a big Tank and Pump, and good water supply. They had commenced to lay the Ground out for Gardens, with cinder paths, etc. Every building had a number of brand new stoves in them, and the labels were still attached. The dugouts all had stoves in ‘em, too.\n\nThe Country round about is very pretty. All the old shell holes are grown over with wild flowers and grass. There are Wine and Beer Bottles, and empty cigar boxes everywhere, and Fritz seems to have a pretty good time in his Camps. His string and sand bags are made from Paper, and he seems to have a substitute for almost everything.\n","238":"\n\nFritz was over again last night and kept us awake with his Bombs. Bridle, one of the chaps who came with me from Weymouth is camped near here. He does the cooking for his crowd. I went over to the A.D.S. this morning. There seems to be a good crowd of wounded coming thro’, and quite a good sprinkling of Huns. Several batches of prisoners have gone by, but they don’t look up to much.\n\nWe moved again after Tea, up to the 25 A.S.C. Line. We are camped in a Paddock, near a Battery of 9.2. We had to dig a hole and roof it over with Trench Covers. We passed over a Bridge on our way here, which Fritz has blown up with Bombs 5 times, but it doesn’t take the Engineers long to fix it up again.\n","239":"\n\nWe moved near the Village of Hem. Had to dig a Hole and cover it with Tarps for a Camp. Rather cramped for space. There is a Battery of 8\" Guns close by, but thank the Lord they are only for use in case of S.O.S.\n","240":"\n\nThe Hun continues to fall back and we are kept continually on the move. The whole bloomin’ army seems to be looking for itself. We are attached to the 25 A.S.C. now. The Tucker is very rough. We thought it was good to be attached to A.S.C., but so far it’s a dud. I’d sooner go back with the 8th than fooling around like this.\n","241":"\n\nLast night things were very exciting. First of all Fritz’s planes came over and bombed all around us. Then one of his High Velocity shells went into the Ground about 10 yds away from our dugout. We were just settling down again, when the picket sung out \"Gas\". Then there was a wild struggle to find our Gas masks, and we had to wear them for about an hour till we got the \"All clear\". We had to move up again nearer the A.S.C. I rode the Bike, but it was a very dusty ride. We are camped on the side of a Hill, near a big stack of Fritz’s shells of various sizes. \n\nThere is a big swamp just across the Road, which is simply teeming with water hen. I had a good Bath and did some washing. The water was very cold. At night we had to move back to our old Camp again. Just as we were moving off a terrific thunderstorm broke loose. And it rained like fury. It was quite dark when we reached Camp, so we just had to crawl in under a Tarp, and sleep there.\n","242":"\n\nSlept fairly comfortable last night, altho’ it was on the Ground. Fritz was quiet for once. We found quite a good \"humpy\", and moved the Postal Gear into it. My kit bag arrived from Base. There are plenty of good dugouts about. We are moving again tomorrow. They did give us time to settle down. I really ought to write some Letters, but with this continual moving about one doesn’t get the chance. \"Sleep\" and I slept in a dinky little dugout on our own.\n","243":"\n\nPacked up again after Break. Bill Hanagan, Charley and Shep went away with the wagons, and I am left behind to guard the mail. Looked thro’ my Bundle of B.E.’s Letters. Sorted out a few and burnt ‘em, but it hurt to have to do it, Lill. Please excuse me for not writing often, dear, as I haven’t time. I’m always thinking of you tho’. J.X.\n\nAbout 2 pm I had a \"sumptuous\" repair (on my lonesome) of Pork and Beans and Bread and Jam.\n\nA Tommy strolled casually along and had a yarn. He said he had been in France 2 years and 8 months and only had 1 leave of 8 days. Poor beggar I felt sorry for him. No matter how bad a man’s Luck may appear, one can always find someone worse off than himself.\n\nAbout 4 the motor lorry blew along to Rail Head at La Neville. Here I saw Tom Harling, my motor school friend. Had Tea and a wash and shave. Then Tom and I wandered thro’ the battered village to the Y.M. where we partook of Cocoa and Biscuits.\n","244":" \n\n Slept fairly well last night, altho’ it was on a \"down\" Bed. Turned out about 8 and had breakfast. Bacon, Bread and Jam, Tea. Then I boarded the mail Lorry and came out to Halle which is about 20 odd Kilos from La Neuville. It was a bumpy, dusty ride and I was not sorry when we reached our destination. Here I found llW fixed up quite snug, for once.\n\nI put in an application to Capt Fletcher to be sent back to my unit and also wrote to O.C. of the 8th, asking him to claim me.\n\nFritz occupied this village for some time and is in the same shattered condition as every other place he has been driven from.\n","245":"\n\nLast night Fritz came over in strong force with his planes and bombed around here. Our A.A. Guns gave them a lively time and searchlights lit up the sky for miles around. I don’t like Fritz’s bombs. They give one such an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of ones stomach. He was buzzing around till about 2 this morning. We were just settling down to try and get another sleep, when the A.S.C. trumpet blared out \"Reveille\". But we took no notice of it. Slept in till about 8 then we got Break. from the 9th F. Amb, cook.\n\nWrote Letter 38 to M.S.\n","246":"\n\nLast night we dug down a couple of feet in our Tent and made a sort of earthwork in case Fritz dropped a Bomb near us. It rained nearly all night and Fritz didn’t come over, so had a good nights sleep. I left my strop, mirror belt and pocket knife behind at Rail Head, so it was rather a disastrous trip. \n\nThis morning I strolled casually into the 9th D.S. and asked for some digitalis. The chap in the dispensary said he couldn’t give it to me without seeing the Doctor. So I saw the Doc, Capt Sampson, who marked me straight away for evacuation. So I said \"Hooray\" to the Post Office Boys and came away in a motor to 5 GG’s at Proyart about 8. Had a couple of feeds aboard the Train. Didn’t get any sleep, arrived Rouen about 4.30 on\n","247":"\n\nHere we were met by motor char-a-banes and driven to No 3 Stat Hosp. Here we had Break. Porridge, Bacon and Tomato, B and B and Coffee. Went down well too. About 10 we went before the Doctor. He marked me \"Tachycardia. Some Hypotrophy\" and sent me to No 2 Con. Camp. Had a nice hot bath and change of clothes.\n\nAfter Tea about 20 of us boarded a motor bus and came thro’ Rouen to No 2 Con. Camp. Here we were issued with Blankets and put in Tent R8. \n","248":"\n\nWent before the Doctor this morning who marked me 1 days no duty and to see him again tomorrow. There is not much doing in Camp and the sooner I’m out of it the better. After Tea a number of us went for a stroll along the Road about a couple of mile from Camp. The Food is not too good, but it is not as bad as it was when I was here with \"Oriss\" last","249":" months.\n","250":"\n\nWell, I’m hanged if I know where I am now. I’ve missed a day somewhere. This is Saturday 14 so I’m \"bushed\".\n\nAnyhow I went to see the quack again this morning and he said I needed a few days rest and P.T., but I said I preferred to be sent to the Base, so he marked me a big A and I am going to the Base on Monday.\n\nAfter Tea there was a Dance at the Y.M. A Buck dance, no Girls being present. The orchestra supplied the music and it was real good Fun. If the Head Specialist had been there a good number would have been marked a big A.\n","251":"\n\nGlorious day, but hot. Went to Church Parade. Fine, cheery service. Orchestra supplied music. Parson delivered excellent address on \"Bad Language\". After dinner went into Rouen. Had a good look round city, visited Cathedral. Returned Camp about 8 pm.\n","252":"\n\nThe Lord only knows when I’m going to get any mail. Handed in my Blankets this morning and have to parade at 4.30 again to march over to Detail Camp. Hot day.\n\nAttended \"Lena Ashwell\" Concert at Y.M. Very good. After Tea fell in with crowd marked out and marched over to Detail Camp ready for departure to Base. Only one blanket and the Tent floor was hard.\n","253":"\n\n\"Reveille\" at 4 a.m. It thundered and Lightened all night and rained like furry. Had no sleep. Breakfast at 4.30. No Candle in Tent. Pitch dark. Started rolling a Blanket round my Leg in mistake for Puttee. Marched down to Rouen Station. Here we got aboard the usual cattle Trucks. \"Chevaux 8\" and steamed merrily away to Le Havre. We passed thro’ a number of Tunnels of considerable Length. \n\nSaw a number of German prisoners ploughing. The country was very pretty, and the peaceful looking Farms nestling in the valleys were a pleasing contrast to the war area we had passed thro’. Arrived Le Havre about 11.30 Harfleur Station. Had Tea and Bread and Dripping Y.M. and were then allotted to our various Camps. We came to No 24 Camp. Had a wash and Tea at 4.30. After Tea went to Picture Show at Y.M, which was very good.\n","254":"\n\nHad a good Breakfast. Porridge and Rissoles. Went before M.O. at 9 and am marked for Med Board tomorrow. Good dinner. Roast meat, cabbage, Potatoes, onions, Pudding. Issued with Tin Hat, new book, etc.\n\nAfter dinner was Paid 20 Frances. I went to the Church Army Hut ti write some Letters, but thought I’d better wait till tomorrow to see how I get on at the Board. Saw Bill Watson.\n","255":"\n\nRaining again. Muster Parade. They are rounding up the A.W.L’s and Leave to Havre is stopped for 3 days. Had Curried Rabbit for Dinner; which was very nice. After Tea took a stroll along to see Bill Watson, who is working in the Officer’s Cook House. \n\nWent up before the Blacksmith for a Board. It was the usual FARCE and he marked me for \"Light Hospital duty\", so now I shall be messing around on Hospital duties.\n\nWent up to Post Office to see W.O. Whitelaw, and he said that unless I was marked B class he could not put me on Postal duty. The ways of the Army are certainly strange.\n","256":"\n\nThe rats had a night out last night and I passed a very restless night. Pottering about a Camp is enough to drive a man to drink. After Tea I went for a stroll into the village. The country round here is very pretty. Beautiful shady woods and lanes. The leaves are beginning to fall, and winter draws near.\n","257":"\n\nRained heavily all night. The W.O. told a chap named Biddle, and I to report for duty to the Dentist’s place. I am pottering around in the workshop making false teeth, and Biddle (3 F. Amb) is working in the vulcanising room. We get a pass any day we like so I went to the Sports after Dinner and from there on to Le Havre. \n\nSaw about 2000 Yanks march from the Boat to the Train on their way to the Line, and very well they looked. They carry very awkward looking packs.\n","258":" \n\nRaining again. Did about an hours work at the Dental Hospital and got another pass to the City. Had Tea at Y.M. There are plenty of Yanks in the City and they seem a very decent crowd.\n","259":" \n\nCold, wet day. Busy time at Dentists. They turn teeth out just like a butcher turning out sausages. It’s a pretty constant Job. Went up to Church Army Hut at night and wrote Letter 37 to M.S.\n","260":" \n\nAbout 6 of the S\/Sgts in the Dental Workshop are going over to Blighty for duty and their places are being filled by men from Blighty. All the 1914 men are going home for 6 months leave and they are arriving at the Base in big numbers, getting ready for the great event. The war news continues good. The Turks and Bulgars are getting shook up now.\n\nWrote Mother.\n\nHughie Reid is in the Tent with me.\n","261":" \n\nThe war news continues good. Had quite a bust day at the Dentist. Hughie Reid is warned for draft. After Tea went to Pictures and then on to Salv Army Hut, where we had some Tea and Jam Roll, which was mighty good. After that we attended a Sing Song.\n","262":"\n\nJust a year ago today, since I was wounded at Ypres. Reidy went away today. We were all issued with Comforts Fund Parcel which should have been handed out for last Xmas. There being a few months late did not make them any less welcome. They contained some \"Aussy Cigs and Tobacco, which are a very pleasant change from the Issue Stuff.\n\nAfter Tea dropped a few Lines to France.\n","263":" \n\nThe Yanks had another \"hop over\" yesterday and got a few more thousand prisoners. Went on Sick parade this morning and got marked \"Digitalis\" for 7 days. Stayed in Camp and wrote a Letter.\n","264":" \n\nBusy day at Dentist. Bought a few Cards from Salvation Army Hut.\n","265":" \n\nMiserable, wet day. One good thing we had a jolly good Dinner, which made things better.\n\nWent into Havre after Dinner. Had Tea at Y.M. Strolled around the City and returned to Camp by 8.35 to Rouelles.\n","266":"\n\nGlory: Alleluia. Got a big bundle of mail today. 8 Glorious long Letters from M.S. Good old Girl. I must do some writing now. I’ve got enough to keep me busy for weeks to come. 7 Letters from M.S. 3 from Mother, 2 from France, 1 from \"Oniss\", Bth’day Cards from M.S. and Nell. The wonderful Baby has arrived at last and is, of course, the most wonderful Boy in the world. B.E. will be kept buasy now, nursing and looking after \"Young Hook\" as Mother calls him. Lill sent 8 snapshots, which were simply delightful. Gee: M.S. does look bonnie.\n\nAttended French Class at Y.M.C.A. But I won’t be much good till I get a Book.\n","267":"\n\nTook on a new Job this morning. In charge of drying Room. The dentist’s wasn’t a bad Job, but I can make a few francs at this Job and I want to buy something special for M.S. and \"Young Hook\" for Xmas.\n","268":" \n\nMuster Parade this morning, a Frenchman and two Tommies came round and tried to identify somebody, but they didn’t manage it. A draft came in from Blighty this morning, and I saw Sgt Mathieson among them. I heard later that the Frenchman recognised the chap he was looking for down at the Infantry Base. It appears the the Digger went for a drive in the Frenchman’s car. He gave a 5F note in payment. The Froggie pulled out his wallet to get change, and \"Aussie\" snatched it and ran away. It contained 90Fs.\n\nHad quite a busy day in the Drying Room. Attended French class, but I’m afraid I’m too thick in the Head to learn much.\n","269":" \n\nFine day. The war news is still excellent, and I do believe that the war id drawing to an end.\n\nHad another busy day in Drying Room. Got Paid yesterday, 40Fs. A Franc is getting more valuable every day now, which is a very good sign. A pound is only worth 26Fs now, before it was 27.25. \n\nBought some French Books tonight and a writing Pad. Attended concert at Y.M., a Frenchman on cello and Lady at Piano. Yank recited, very good.\n","270":" \n\nNothing very exciting happened. Was pretty bust all day. After Tea went to Y.M. but as Madame did not turn up there was no French class. After I hunted round all the Canteens for Pen nibs and couldn’t get any.\n\nI commenced a Letter to M.S.\n\nSgt Mathieson came in and had a yarn.\n","271":" \n\nFairly busy day. \"Matto\" is warned for draft, so I guess he will be moving off tomorrow. The Camp is pretty full now. A big A.M.C. draft came in today, and they are 13 and 14 to a Tent, so \"Bill\" came and camped with me in the Drying Room.\n","272":" \n\nWar news continues good, Bulgaria boss \"Slung in the Towel\" and now Germany is squealing for Peace.\n\nWent into City after Dinner. Raining. Cleared up later, and my coat became a nuisance. Had Tea at Y.M. with chap from Dentists. Bought souvenir for \"Young Hook\", also a number of Xmas Cards.\n\nHad a sing song in Train coming back to Camp.\n","273":" \n\nDrizzly wet day. \"Matts\" went away yesterday. There was no French class again tonight. Madame must be \"Boker malade\". Gee: I’ll forget what bit I learnt. \n\nAfter Tea wrote France and Arthur, and sent Xmas Cards to Dave and Ruth.\n","274":" \n\nWhat rotten weather. Did some washing today but I’m hanged if I can get it dry. There are all sorts of rumours floating about. Austria and Turkey are said to have \"thown in the Towel\", but it’s not official.\n","275":" \n\nGot letter from Mrs Sam yesterday. Am has been made Srgt. That’s what \"gets\" me. Here am I bumming around the Camp, unfit for the Line and I’ve got no bloomin’ chance of promotion. \"Oh: it’s a lovely war\", I don’t think.\n","276":"\n\nThis is a great country for Rain. They never ought to be short of water, yet they sometimes are. The war news continues good. I really think the war will end in my time.\n","277":"\n\nNo French class again – Madame is ill. Gee: I’ll just about forget what little I learnt.\n\nI really must try and write some Letters. I’m hanged if I seem to get ant time to myself lately.\n","278":" \n\nThe sun actually shone for a few minutes today, Glory: Alleluia: \n\nGot some more Mail today. 2 from M.S., 1 from Mother and a tract of some kind from some Society in Sydney. Very kind of ‘em to take so much interest in me, I’m sure. Lill sent me two lovely snaps of herself, one holding the wonderful Baby. Gee: B.E. does look bonnie. She’s the sweetest kid on this old earth and I do believe she knows it but tells me she is \"Just an ordinary Person\". \n\nHad Vapour Bath and donned clean change. Put in for Leave Pass for tomorrow.\n","279":" \n\nWent into Havre. Intended to visit Art Gallery, but no one seemed to know where it was. Bought some P. Cards to send Lill. Had Tea at a Café near the Sal Army 4.20 but came away still feeling hungry.\n\nWrote Letter 41 to M.S.\n","280":"\n\nToby Barton is in Camp. He informs me that Bert Hunt is in the Con. Camp, so I must go and see him. The weather is rotten – raining every bloomin’ day. Toby also told me that Jim Eldridge and Charley Whitaker were killed. Was very sorry to hear it. Lill will be sorry to hear of it too, as she held Jim’s hand over at a Concert at Queen’s Park.\n","281":" \n\nToby Barton went up the Line today. Saw Bert Hunt and had a great old yarn. Went to the Pictures and had a Feed of Eggs at Sal. Army. The war news continues good, and the End is certainly felling near.\n\nI’ll be back with M.S. soon now, I hope.\n","282":" \n\nWent to Pictures with Bert Hunt. He has put in for a Pass tomorrow so I must try and get in with him.\n","283":" \n\nWent into Havre with Bert Hunt. Made another attempt to find Art Gallery, but ended up in \"Tostones\". Had a pretty good day.\n","284":" \n\nLille has fallen, and several other important towns. Fritz is getting all he wants nowadays. Bert is warned for draft, so I guess he’ll be going away tomorrow. Scotty McFadyon called to see me, and Ernie Calf. Quite a lot of the 8th have been here this last few days.\n","285":" \n\nBert Hunt and \"Scotty\" went away today. Ernie Calf went into Havre, so I went to the \"Yellow Dandies\" Concert on my own. Pretty good show.\n","286":"\n\nWent into Havre. Had Fish and Chips for Tea. Bought some Cards. Met a chap out of A.S.C. and knocked about with him. Saw a lovely silk scarf in a shop today which I’d like to buy for M.S.\n","287":"\n\nGreat news in Sunday Papers. Ostend and Zeebruge are ours, and things are \"booming\" everywhere. The weather keeps rotten and nearly everyone is suffering from a cold.\n","288":"\n\nErnie Calf comes up to Drying Room every day and keeps me company. The weather is very cold now. War news continues good.\n","289":"\n\nWent into Havre with Ern Calf. Found the Picture Gallery but it was closed again. Must try my Luck next time I’m in. Had Tea at the Y.M. (Crystal Palace). They only allowed us one egg each, it was always 2 before. Bought few more Post Cards for M.S. Went into silk shop to see if that silk scarf was there, it is, but the price is 60Fs. Lot of money, but I must see if I can’t manage it. She’s worth it, anyhow.\n","290":" \n\nErn Calf went away this morning, so now I’m \"on my own\" again. Took a run into Havre on the Motor, but it was jolly cold. Nice day. The sun actually shone for a while.\n","291":"\n\nIt’s about time I wrote some Letters, or people will begin to think I’ve forgotten ‘em. Wrote Mother and Mrs Sam Ibbs. Fine day, but cold.\n","292":" \n\nWar news continues good, our troops near Valenciennes, the famous Lace Town. Went to Concert at Y.M. Very good, much better than last Sat. night. \n","293":"\n\nNo Leave today. Le Havre is out of Bounds owing to Influenza. Had a Bath in drying Room. \n\nWrote 42 to M.S.\n\nGlory: Alleluia! : here it is now Nov 12th and I haven’t put a word in my Diary since","294":" Anyhow, here goes to try and bring it \"up to date\".\n","295":"\n\nA.G.B.D. Le Havre\n\nThe City is still \"out of Bounds\" but the Influenza seems to be abating. It gets very monotonous in Camp and one is glad of a run into the City occasionally.\n\nFri Nov 1st\n\nFelt rotten all day. At night went to Med. Tent and asked for a dose of med. The chap in charge took my Temp. It was 102°, so he sent me into Hospital as hes said I had the \"Flu\". Had to fly round and put my gear in Q.M. store, before going into Camp Hospital.\n","296":" \n\nSlept well last night between nice white sheets. Porridge and drink of milk for Break. Pas bow Doc came round about 11, marked me \"Light diet and stay in Bed\". Had Beef Tea and milk Pudding for Dinner. No visitors are allowed in Hospital on account of \"Flu\". The Padres come in tho’ and take Letters away to be censored. I’m hanged if I can write.\n","297":" \n\nSpent another quite day in Bed. Made an attempt to write Letter, but I hate writing in Bed, and had to give it up. Am still on Light diet.\n","298":" \n\nThank the Lord my Temp is down again. Now I can have something to eat. Lill will begin to wonder what’s wrong if I don’t write my weekly epistle. But what’s the good of me writing like this when she knows that I didn’t write. At least she will do when she gets my Letter No 43. \n\nHad a good dinner today. Stewed Rabbit, and a drink of good Tea, with real sugar in it.\n","299":" \n\nGot Letter from Perce Taylor at Weymouth. He seems to be having a good time. The Salv. Army came round today and brought us some Butter Scotch, which was mighty welcome. He is a fine chap, with a cheerful smile and a voice like a roaring Bull.\n\nFeeling much better.\n","300":" \n\nThe Red X chap came round today. Brought us Chocolate and Tobac and Cigs and Papers to read. Mighty welcome they were, too. Got up yesterday and today and am feeling pretty good again.\n","301":"\n\nDischarged from Hosp and returned to A.G.B.D.\n","302":"\n\nWent into Town. Had Tea at Fish Shop, near Sal. Army Hostel. Everybody is in good spirits and seems to think that the Huns will sign the Armistice tomorrow. Returned to camp by the 8.35. \n\nMon 11.\n\nWent into Town again about 10.30. Got a ride in motor Lorry. Got into Town just as the news arrived that said the Armistice was signed. The Guns were banging away, Church Bells ringing, Bands playing and everybody going mad. The Guns made an awful noise and we could see the shells busting in the air, over the harbour.\n\nArmistice Day in Le Havre.","303":"\n\nEverybody was shaking hands with everybody else. The French people said \"La Guerre finis. Tres Bien\". The Girls from the munitions Factories, the Tommies from the Army workshops, Belgians, French, Yanks and all sorts and conditions of men, women and kids formed up into a procession with flags of all sorts flying, and every kind of musical instrument playing.\n\nIt kept increasing in size as it went along, and must have been a mile long, the last I saw of it. What struck me about it was that there were no \"Aussies\" among the crowd. It was rather too early for them to be in Town.\n\nHad some Dinner at the Y.M.C.A. After Dinner the Town filled up very quickly and the A.I.F. was well represented. A French Band played in the Gardens. The crowd by this time were quite excited and when the Band played the National\n\nAnthems of the different Allies, they gave vent to their feelings, and \"The Marseillaise\" was sung with fervor. As I listened to the music, the thing that struck me was what a \"poor washed out\" tune was \"God Save the King\" when compared to the \"Marseillaise\" or the Belgian National Hymn.\n\nThe Armistice was signed on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.\n\nWed Jan 8\n\nO Lord, back in this miserable hole again with its eternal mud and rain. Got letter from Mother and \n1 from M.S.\n, which cheered things up a bit. Mother says that Lill is looking very well, which is mighty good news. \n\nPut in for a day pass to go to Weymouth tomorrow.\n","304":"\n\nGot a ride out to Westham in Ambulance. It broke down several times on the way, but it was much better than walking, anyhow; as it rained in torrents. Saw Perce Taylor and Jack Cox, both of whom had just returned from Leave. Also saw the Q.M. who gave me a note to say that I handed in my waterproof cape.\n\nTook the letter I got from Ted Sutton to Serg. Travill in the S.M.O.’s office. He said I was too late for the \"Ulysses\" but he would put me on the \"Euriped\" which sails about the","305":" of this month. So I returned to Littlemoor feeling that I had done a good days work. \n","306":"\n\nVisited Q.M. this morning and handed in my note, but he said it was useless, as it did not have an officer’s signature, so I’ve got to go thro’ it all again.\n","307":"\n\n\"Turned out\" about 9. Made some Tea and Toast and had Bre3akfast. About 11, just as I had finished having a Bath in the Drying Room, the S.M. of No 4 Coy came round and informed us that we were to be prepared to go aboard the Boat for U.K. at 3.30 am. This was the best news we had heard for ages. I shook hands with the W.O. and told him that if ever he was near my place in Sydney he was to come in and I’d give him the best drink of whisky in the House. (Of course B.E. may not allow any whisky in the House, but that won’t be my funeral). Went round and said \"Hooray\" to the mob. \n\nHad good Dinner. Marched down to Reinforcement Camp. Fell in with a crowd of Tommies on their way to Blighty. We broke away from the procession and went into Havre on the Train. It was packed, so we, had to hang on like so many Flies. Got into Havre at about 4.30. Went to Crystal Palace and had Tea and bought some Tobacco. Then we made our way down to the \"Quai d’ Escale\" where our Boat was to sail from. Met a number of WAACS on the way, who bade us an affectionate Farewell. Arrived at the Boat about 6. All the others had been aboard some time and the Officer in charge of us said \"O, you’re here at last. If I lost any of my Party, it would be Diggers, sure thing\".\n\nGrabbed our Packs off the Wharf and climbed aboard. On our way to the Boat we bought a couple of Loaves, as all we were issued with at the Base was 6 Anzac wafers per man. There was plenty of Room on the Boat. Our party of 5 were the only Aussies aboard. We sailed at about 9 pm. As the lights of Havre faded away I could not help feeling a bit \"touchy\" as I’ve had some jolly good times in France, as well as some rough ones. Got into conversation with a Yank sailor who informed me that there were only about 250 men aboard, and they usual carried 2,500. She was a comfortable boat and steam radiators kept the place quite warm. \n\nA couple of stewards \"came to light\" with sandwiches and excellent \"Café au lait\" which had been prepared for officers, but as only a small number of officers came aboard, we derived the benefit and had a good supper before pulling our great coats over us and going to sleep. Considering the fact that my Bunk was a couple of Life Belts, I slept well and did not wake up till about 5 am, on Monday 9. \n\nI lay on my \"Bunk\" for about an hour listening to the swirl of the water on the sides of the Boat and the screeching of the Sea-birds as they hovered around our Boat.\n","308":"\n\nWe tied up at Sthhampton somewhere about 8 o’clock. There we were met by a Serg from H.Q. who put us aboard a Train for London where we arrived about 11 a.m. at Waterloo. From here we hopped aboard a Bus and went to Victoria which is quite near Horseferry Rd.\n\nReported at 1.30 where they kept us fooling around from one office to another till about 1, then we went to a Red X Room where a chap gave us a sausage roll, and stale bun and a mouthful of cold tea in a cup. Various notices hung on the wall of the Hut informed us that this \"splendid repast\" was given to us by the Aust Red X. After fooling around for another couple of hours they gave us a pass and told us to report again at 10 am tomorrow.\n\nWe went to the War Chest Club, where we had a good feed for the modest sum of a shilling. Then I booked a Bed for the night. After that I went to the Pay Office and go my Book fixed up. They only gave me 16\/-, but that was enough for one night. I booked a seat for the \"Garrick Theatre\" to see \"By Pigeon Post\". I would have liked to see \"George Robey\" in the \"Bing Boys\" but all the seats were booked. We got a","309":" seat for 3\/6. \n\nHad Tea a War Aust, shaved and went to the Show which was very good.\n","310":"\n\n\"Turned out\" about 9 after a good night’s sleep. Had Breakfast, sausage and egg, porridge, coffee, bread and butter, then reported to O.R. at 10 am as ordered. The Serg wanted to make out our Railway Warrant for Tidworth, but I stuck out against that and got paraded to Capt Sorrensen, who said \"Certainly they are to go to Weymouth\". This made us smile. \n\nWe left Waterloo at 12.30, and arrived at Weymouth about 4.30. Marched to Westham Camp where we were allotted to Huts. Tom Murrell and I went into Weymouth and had Tea. Then we strolled along the Prom for a while and returned to Camp about 9, where we were soon in Bed and asleep.\n\nWed 11\n\nAfter dinner we paraded again and marched to Weymouth Station, where we boarded the Train for Upwey. This was only about a 3 mile trip. From Upwey we marched to Littlemoor Camp. It must be very pretty around here in Summer, but it is rather cheerless looking country now. 20 of us were allotted to B Hut.\n","311":"\n\nThe Food is pretty good in this Camp and there is plenty of it. We were boarded again this morning. Major Maplestone (from Sutton Very) examined me and marked me B2A, so surely I’ll soon be Home with B.E. now. Major Irving was also boarding, but I missed going before him. A number of us went into Weymouth after Tea. Corp Karley from Geelong being one of the Party. We had Tea in there; which cost us 2\/6 each. Sausages and Eggs. Eggs are awfully dear, so I suppose a man mustn’t growl at the price.\n","312":" \n\nIt is jolly cold down here and one appreciates a bit of Fire. We went thro’ the Q.M. store today and got issued with our shortages. They gave me a Tunic about 3 sizes too big, so I must try and change it, as I must go Home decently clothed, altho’ I don’t suppose that B.E. will mind much what I wear.\n","313":" \n\nWent on sick parade today. There was nothing wrong but as Maj. Irving is M.O. of our Coy, I just went on Parade to see him and he said \"Hello, Peter, I thought toy were Home long ago\". \"No such Luck\" I said. He marked my Paper for some Cough picture. I saw him later in the day, when he asked me if I was on a Boat Roll, and when I said \"no\" he said he would do what he could for me, so that raises my Hopes still higher.\n","314":" \n\nWent into Weymouth after Dinner. It is very quiet in there now. Vastly different to when I was here in the Summer.\n\nWrote Letter 45 to B.E.\n","315":" \n\nBoat rolls seem to be made out every day here, so I ought to soon see mt name on one. My hands are that bloomin’ cold I can hardly hold the pencil. We are not allowed to light our Fire till after dinner owing to the coal shortage, so we had to do a \"perish till then!\".\n","316":"\n\nWhat rotten weather, nothing but rain day after day. I’m hanged if I’ve been warm since being here. It will be a treat to see some sunshine again.\n\nHooray: Got some more mail today. 3 from M.S., 2 Mother, 1 Nell. Mother is going to Sydney at last. I’m jolly glad of that. The change will do her good. \n\nWent into Town after Tea. Met Art Williams on the prom. It poured in rain on the return journey and we got somewhat damp.\n","317":" \n\nAnother Boat Roll out today but my name did not appear on it. It is quite frosty today, quite a change from the Rain. There are a number of German prisoners working about the Camp. Things are very free and easy in this Camp. I haven’t been on Parade since I’ve been here. In fact I don’t know where the Parade Ground is.\n","318":" \n\nMet Bill Beards today who used to work with me at Sutton Very. He has his toe operated on and is marked C1.\n","319":" \n\nNothing exciting happened this last few days. I started off to walk into Weymouth yesterday but the weather was so rotten I changed my mind and stayed in Camp. This morning I wrote Mother. I must write France tomorrow or she will begin to think I have forgotten her. Went into Y.M. Hut about 8, where a Lady with a very sweet voice sang a number of songs. \n\nI am acting Sergeant of the Day Canteen today. It’s not a bad job. The worst part of it is that one has to parade at 10 pm, and it’s not too pleasant hanging around these cold nights.\n","320":"\n\nFine day. After Tea walked into Weymouth with Cpl Kesley. Had Tea there, sausages and chipped potatoes.\n","321":"\n\nThings are very quiet in Camp. It’s hard to realise it’s Xmas time. Fitzpatrick, our Hut Cpl and Humphries went away yesterday morning. I am Hut Cpl.\n","322":"\n\nStarted the day well by having Stew for Breakfast. It is a very cold dismal sort of day. During the morning we took our seats, tables and mess gear down to the Dry Canteen where we having Dinner. At 1 we \"fell in\" and filled into the Canteen. It was gaily decorated with Holly and mistletoe, and the Tables were laid with nuts and other good things. We had Turkey and Pork and Vegetables and Jolly good Plum Pudding, and Beer. It was quite a good Xmas Dinner. \n\nAfter that we filed out of the door and each man was issued with 2 pkts cigs, 1 cigar and some chocolate. The cigars were quite decent, and I exchanged my cigs for cigars.\n\nDuring the afternoon each of us was issued with a Red X Xmas Parcel, which contained cigs, tobacco, and various other good things. At 7.30 there was a Concert which was one of the best shows I’ve seen for some time.\n\nTaking it all round, it was quite a Good Xmas Day, but I hope it will be the last I shall spend away from my B.E.\n","323":"\n\nThere were Sports on today at Westham, and many of our chaps attended. I would have gone myself but the boots I’m wearing nearly cripple me. They are only issuing second-hand Boots now and I’m hanged if I can get a pair to fit me.\n","324":"\n\nOn Monday I put in for 4 days Leave from Jan 3 to 7. I hope it comes thro’ as I’d like to see a bit more of London before I sail away to the \"Land of Sunshine\" again.\n","325":" \n\nWalked out to Westham after Dinner, but everybody I wanted to see was away on leave. Jack Cox, Perce Taylor and the Q.M. Serg; so my long walk was all for nothing. Had Tea at Y.M. and returned to Camp about 8.30. There are a no. of Boat Rolls to come out shortly, so my name ought to appear among ‘em.\n\nBert Berry is in this Camp, like myself awaiting a Boat. Saw Maj. Irving this morning who gave me an order for a pair of Light Boots, which are quite decent.\n","326":"\n\nAnother rotten day. The weather around here is enough to drive a man to drink. Even the beer is icy cold, and a man can’t drink much of that. Cpl Duffy is in camp here. He told me today he is Temporary Serg. Lucky beggar. He must be a Mason. Bert Berry is also in this Camp and awaiting a Boat Home.\n\nWrote 47 to B.E.\n","327":" Last day but one of 1918. \n\nGot Letter from Horrie Playford and 2 from France. Poor old Girl, she appears to be having a rough time. Took my Tunic down the village to get washed. \n\nBill Beards is in this Camp. Went into Weymouth with him the other night. My Leave is thro and I expect a run up to London on Friday.\n\nTues 31. New Year’s Eve.\n\nThis time last year I was in Stow and sat up to see the New Year in, but don’t think will do so tonight. Most of the crowd are gone into Town. Things are very quiet in Camp.\n","328":" Littlemoor Camp\n\nThe New Year came in wet. Rained all day and cold wind. Things passed off very quietly. A few of the Boys came Home a bit merry. \n\nWe could hear the Guns banging away at Devonport, and the Church Bells ringing. To celebrate this auspicious day we had \nstew\n for Breakfast.\n","329":"\n\nGetting ready to go on Leave tomorrow. Got paid £2.15\/-. Had good hot bath and donned clean change. Paid for Railway Ticket, 12\/-, made a hole in my \"Oscar Asche\". \n","330":" \n\nGot ticket from Furlo’ Office and marched to Upwey Station – about 50 of us. Got train about 10. Arrived Waterloo at 2.20pm. Caught Tube to St James’ Park and walked from there to Horseferry Rd. Had Dinner there and bought Cigarettes. 100 for 2\/-. \n\nThen a couple of us booked seats for the Alhambra \"Bing Boy’s on Broadway\". Went for a stroll around the City. Had Tea at Lyon’s. Passed away a pleasant hour in a very fine Picture Show near the Alhambra. Then we went to the show. It was very good, but I was a bit disappointed. Robey is the whole show, greatly assisted by Violet Lorraine. There’s no one else in the show. There were a couple of good songs but not one good singer. Robey is very funny and Violet Lorraine a fine actress and comedienne. \n","331":" \n\nHad Breakfast at War Chest. It is easily the best place for a feed in London. Strolled around the city. Saw the changing of Guard at Whitehall. Very interesting. The weather is very cold and wet. It is much lighter in the city at night than in the daytime. London is full of soldiers, and it is difficult to get a seat at any of the Theatres. I booked a seat at the \"Coliseum\". It was a good show. The music alone was worth the money. I did not care for the Russian Ballet. There was a performing seal that was almost human.\n","332":" \n\nAttended Service at Westminster Abbey. The singing was beautiful, but the service was \"dry as dust\". \n\nWas on my way back to the Club when I met Bill Avonson, so I hopped on to a Train with him and went as far as the \"Eagle Hut\" where he had to meet a chap. Then we had some dinner at a Dago restaurant, where they charged us 4\/6 each, and we left still feeling hungry. After that we strolled around the City. Had Tea at the \"Strand Corner House\". Very nice. Good Food and Good music and prices very reasonable.\n\nAfter that I went with him to where he was staying, near Kings X Station. We sat yarning for a time then went and had some Tea. Eggs and Toast. Then we tried to get to a Picture Show but every place was crowded, so about 9 I went Home with him and stayed the night.\n","333":" \n\nBill and I slept in till about 10.30, then the old Lady came up and said our Breakfast was spoiling so we hopped out and had a good feed of Eggs and Bacon. Then he had to go away, and I strolled back to the War Chest Club. \n\nHere I met Peter Hutchinson who I hadn’t seen for ages. He was on 14 days Leave from France; and was going up to Glasgow to get married. That will be something to put in my next Letter to Lill. She will be surprised. We knocked around the City till about 10, then we went Home to Bed.\n","334":" \n\nMy last day’s Leave, and it’s gone like a flash of Lightning. Was walking down the Strand this morning when I met Bert Berry, who is also on 4 day’s Leave. It’s foolish to come away for so short a time.\n\nPeter H. and I went up to Aldych Theatre, which is an \"Aussie Y.M.\". We sat and listened to the music till about 4, then I had to hustle off to Waterloo to get my Train. It was packed and I had a Job to find a seat. \n\nWe arrived at Upwey about 10.30, where we were greeted by 2 Greasy Jackos who demanded to see our passes.\n\n"}}
