morning I have seen the District Paymaster and handed to him my pay allotment for my wife. I also interviewed the O.C. Army Service Corps and arranged for sand to be placed on board transport for a sand bath for horses. Horses were embarked by men of units, commencing at 5 P.M. 24th instant; finishing at 12 midnight Sept 24th\/25th. One horse caused a great deal of trouble, and eventually backed over the wharf into the river. It was subsequently rescued.\n\nThe District Commandant invited me to proceed from Brisbane to Pinkenbar in the Naval launch. On arrival at the troop ship I took over custody of cash for use of men on board and had some placed in Captain’s Safe. The Commandant issued to me a message of farewell from His Excellency Sir Arthur Morgan, Governor of Queensland, to the troops of all Transports from Queensland, and as the \"Rangatira\" was the last to leave I was asked to transmit the message by wireless to other ships. The Commandant also personally addressed the troops. He informed me Mr Jopp’s work as Adjutant had been most unsatisfactory.\n\nThe troopship left wharf at Pinkenbar at 12.50 PM amid the tooting of whistles and sirens, and the \"good byes\" of the Soldiers friends and relatives.\n\nThe Veterinary Officer reported a sick horse which he had refused to accept, but which was ultimately ordered to be taken (by the Veterinary Board). This horse had been ill for a week prior to embarkation.\n\nWeather beautifully fine and so far no symptoms of sea sickness.\n","2":"\n\nA very beautiful morning. The rugged coast in the rising sun looks particularly fine. With Col Sutton, the Senior medical Officer on Board I made a thorough inspection of the ship at 10 AM. Parades during the day of gunners at gun drill and fuze setting, rifle exercises, etc. Cleaning up ship generally. Lecture at night to all officers on general Conduct and duties on Board Troopship. Veterinary Officer reported sick horse to be very bad. I had him moved to the deck and specially fed. The Senior Medical Officer reported two cases of venereal disease. Cases were at once isolated.\n\nI interviewed the Adjutant re very unsatisfactory report of his work furnished to me by District Commandant of Queensland, supported by a similar report from the A.A.G. I warned him his promotion to rank of Captain and the keeping of his position at all would depend on the way his duties in the future are carried out. I have given personal instruction to all trumpeters and buglers.\n","3":"\n\nWhen I looked through the port of my Cabin at 6 A.M. I discovered we were off Sydney Heads. The rising sun on the Light Houses and cliffs made a splendid panorama. I inspected all horses at 7 A.M. with Veterinary Officer. Sick horse previously referred to is now unable to stand and had to be slung and fed through a drench. A second sick horse was also moved to upper deck. I gave instructions to move some horses into more suitable stalls, and also arranged for sand both to be prepared and saw it completed. Inspected ship at 10A.M. with Medical Officer. Sick horse destroyed at 3PM and cast overboard. Board at once detailed for same.\n\nI forwarded to District Commandant Brisbane acknowledgement of the State Governor’s message, also acknowledgement of same from \"Satr of England\", \"Anglo Egyptian\" and \"Omrah\". All by wireless.\n","4":"\n\nTwo more cases of venereal disease discovered at morning Sick Parade. General inspection of Ship at 10 AM with P.M.O. I instituted artificers to alter certain mess Fittings to admit more light and air. Arrangements were made for the exercising and massaging of Horses and duties commenced. Gun drill and signalling detachment at work. Landscape targets in use. Rifle exercises carried out. Commencement made with evening classes for Officers and N.C.O.s. From 7.30 to 8PM. For N.C.O.s, and 8 to 8.30 or 9 PM for officers. Standing Orders for 3rd F.A. Brigade were explained to N.C.O.s and Officers. Signalling at night with Begbie lamp. Some horses were during the day moved from aft. stalls to others more centrally situated. I gave instructions for full \"Marching Order\" parade for each Wednesday at 10 AM, and foot parade for Medical Officer each Tuesday at 10 AM. On passing Signal Station at Wilson’s Promontory we received a signal instructing us to call at Queenscliff for Orders. Every Officer speculating as to what this May mean, our instruction previously having been to rendezvous at King George’s Sound, Albany. Coast around Wilson’s Promontory and Back Stairs Passage very rugged. Bitterly cold afternoon and night. Glorious sunset. In view of the fact that \"Examination Anchorage\" work is now being carried out at Queenscliff, Col Sutton and myself decided to take post on the Bridge while entering.\n","5":"\n\nCame up on Captain’s Bridge at 1.30 AM with Col Sutton. The \"Examination Boat\" and the Search lights playing over the water from the Forts made a beautiful picture. The Pilot came on board with instructions for us to proceed to Melbourne. We entered the \"Rip’ with the \"Star of England\" following \n\nin our wake, arrived opposite Port Melbourne and anchored. After the Health Officer had made his inspection anchor was weighed and we moved alongside new Railway Pier, Port Melbourne, berthing at 10 AM. I immediately went to Victoria Barracks, and reported to Colonel Hobbs, Colonel White and General Bridges.\n\nOrdered to allow no leave. Returned to the ship with Major Glasford.\n\nColonel Grimwade, (Embarkation Officer) visited ship at 1 P.M. Instructed to proceed with disembarkation at 9 AM Thursday morning. Col Hobbs inspected ship at 4.30PM. with Major Anderson and Party. Notified that General Bridges would inspect at 10 AM","6":" inst. I made a suggestion to Colonel Hobbs that our horses should be picketed on Crown Land adjoining wharf. Officers and men to take meals aboard ship and sleep there. Colonel Hobbs approved suggestion and promised to consult General Bridges. Adjutant compiled list of Ordnance deficiencies and submitted same to Major Anderson.\n","7":"\n\nGeneral cleaning parade during morning. O.C. Troops inspection at 9 AM. General Bridges (accompanied by Colonel White) and Col Hobbs inspected ship at 10.30 AM. General Bridges expressed his entire satisfaction with the ship. General given \"General Salute\" on arrival. He gave permission to place horses on ground adjoining wharf. Men to sleep and mess on Board.\n\nInspected site for Horse lines, arranged to borrow timber from Wharf Contractor and with plumber for water service. Mr Jopp reported to Head Quarters re Ordnance Supplies; Veterinary Officer also reported to Head Quarters. Artillery horses disembarked.

Col Sutton and F.A. details to show grounds.\n\nAdjutant reported satisfactorily re replacement of Ordnance shortages.\n\nWrote Nell addressed to Gordon. Promised to write boys later.\n","8":"\n\nBorrowed 8x6 timbers and erected horse lines. Ship lowered rope. Adjutant received sundry stores from Ordnance. D.A.C. Section moved off to Broadmeadows. Capt McGee took some battery harness and mixed up a great deal already sorted. He told Major Hughes he intended to make up his deficiencies from other units. I decide the matter must be adjusted at once and arranged for Major Hughes and the Adjutant to visit Broadmeadows to see Col Tunbridge in the matter.\n\nGuns disembarked and made available for drill purposes, but retained on wharf. As member of a Board convened by General Bridges I attended Col Forsyth\n\nin conjunction with Capt Matson on \"Star of England\" from 1.30 to 5.30 PM re condition of horse stalls and horses. Board proceedings completed and recommendation made to the effect that horses being overcrowded, it was desirable to remove 60 or 70 stalls from ship, also that an oat ration should be provided daily, such ration to be gradually increased during the last week of voyage.\n\nCol Kendall P.V.O, inspected ship and horses. Hosing out of ship commenced. I promised to arrange for the cleaning out of stalls allotted to unit sent away from ship. Harness dubbing, and dressing. Picket ropes, rubbers, spurs etc. received from Ordnance. Large fatigue party under Captain Leslie cleaning ship. Two gun detachments from battery and two from B.A. Column at work. \n","9":"\n\nTwo picket lines fixed for Horses and horses properly arranged on same.

Gun carriage draped with Ensign. Mrs Clarke and Registrar attended. Chief Engineer took photo of group. \n\nAt 2 o’clock parade the greater portion of 7th Battery refused to fall in because of lack of leave. I had three guards formed and issued instructions that ship was to be cleared of troops, and every man to parade on wharf. About 60 men ordered into arrest. I read out Governor General’s Warrant concerning Court Martials and informed the whole parade of the Powers vested in me under the Warrant. I also read out to them the penalties awarded for Certain Crimes.\n\nExercised Squire John in the afternoon in Company with the Chief Officer. Had two hours conference with all officers after dinner re lack of discipline, instruction, etc, and generally was successful in straightening out some difficulties. The Chief Steward reported pilfering from bottled ale cases. An ensuing investigation.\n","12":"\n\nFull muster parade at 6.30 AM. I had overnight carefully considered my course of action re Sunday’s business and had decided that as the men had admitted their offence to the O.C. Battery, and had expressed their regret for the incident I felt the best interests of the Brigade would be served by publicly censuring the men, pointing out the seriousness of their position and releasing them. If I have erred on the side of leniency I must abide the consequences but I want to have a loyal command, and I feel an appeal to their honour will in the long run be more effective than fine or imprisonment. I have therefore dismissed the cases and the future must show if my confidence has been misplaced.\n\nDuring the day Saddlery of Battery was checked with that of Divisional Column, which latter harness had been returned from Broadmeadows by order of Colonel Tunbridge. Capt Mc Gee was in attendance with Major Hughes. No less than 12 Battery saddles and other harness were found among Capt McGee’s equipment. Brigade Headquarters unpacking and stamping Harness. Battery at Gun drill, Column teaming horses.\n\nReceived a hint from my Orderly that leave was being irregularly obtained by Brigade Headquarters men. I resolved on a Tattoo parade for Head Quarters details, with the result that it was discovered five men (including a N.C.O) were absent without leave. I decided to wait up and check.\n\nall men returning to Ship. In the meantime in Company with Several Officers I searched the ship in an endeavour to find if any other way of leaving the ship than by the gangway had been prepared. I discovered 4 rope ships ladders hung on the side at various dark points of the ship, also planks leading from Horse decks through iron doors in ship side to jetty. These approaches had evidently been used by the men when leaving ship, with the cooperation of local boats.\n\nI was so annoyed at these discoveries that I posted Officers at the entrance to troop decks, and myself with Capt Leslie took post at gangway. One by one, gunners, drivers and N.C.O. returned to ship, some hiding themselves among wharf piles lying on the wharf. The Guard had to turn them out.\n\nBetween the hours of 11 PM and 5-30 AM on 6th inst no less 62 NCOs, gunners and drivers returned to the ship, having been absent without leave. In this list were included 16 men who had been participants in the number who mutinied on Sunday morning.\n\nMy leniency and warning of the previous day had apparently not been appreciated or acted upon, so the whole squad was ordered into arrest.\n\nThe Officers retired at 2 AM, 6th inst, leaving a strong guard to apprehend any other leave breakers who might put in an appearance.\n","13":"\n\nGeneral parade at 6.15 AM. Every man checked. I had list prepared of prisoners and with Major Hughes called on Col Hobbs to explain the position. I felt there was nothing to be done but send all the culprits up for Court Martial, sentence them to imprisonment and discharge them from their units. Col Hobbs agreed with me, likewise General Bridges, but after a conference it was decided the best course was for me to deal summarily with the men – fine them and stop all leave for those concerned.\n\nI accordingly had the whole command paraded at 2.PM. The defaulters were Marched on Board ship, and in reply to my enquiry they unanimously elected to be dealt with summarily by me.\n\nUnder the powers conferred on me as O.C. troops on the Transport, I therefore awarded penalties as follows:- NCOs to revert to permanent rank, have pay stopped to the extent of ?5 and be refused all leave till further notice.\n\nAll others to have pay stoped to the extent of ?5 and be deprived of all leave. Judging from remarks overheard by me I am of opinion the men have learnt their lesson and I shall have no further trouble.\n\nI shall unhesitatingly court martial any similar offenders in the future.\n\nI feel very keenly the want of loyalty of the Queensland Artillery, and can only\n\nthink lack of knowledge and a lack of appreciation of the enormity of their conduct have led them into a course of action which is untenable.\n\nBattery at work all day with eight 6 horse teams. Ammunition Column assembling and Stamping Harness. Head Quarters Signalling. Gun layers special instruction on two guns.\n\nHanded over to \"Omrah\", \"Star of England\" and \"Anglo Egyptian\", their proportion of oats and rations for use in England.\n\nSpecial oat ration being loaded for use on voyage.\n\nEmbarkation authorities practically completed alteration to Horse stalls and building of Horse brows.\n\nCapt Louden informed me this evening he had purchased a piano for the Ship. All the officers very grateful. Mr Jopp bought extra Gramophone records.\n\nSatisfactory ‘Tattoo’ parade at 8-30.P.M.\n","14":"\n\nThe Battery devoted the day to Battery gun drill and Driving drill. I attended the work of the battery during the morning and was very pleased with the ability displayed by Capt Leslie, both in instructing and in correcting faults. Lieut Urquhart also promises very well as a Section Officer. Drivers did very good work and team horses are in splendid condition. Gun Layers given consistent work on four guns.

Inadvertently I discovered his sister is married to Mr Callaghan of Gordon and is mother of Callaghan. Selected some Part Songs at Allan’s for the use of the men going home. Called on Major Robertson re selling \"Jack\". He was not in. I shall call in again tomorrow. Col Green and Col Merrington (chaplain) called and stayed to dinner.

Also invitation from local Anglican Vicar to early 7 AM Communion. Heard of big disturbance in Melbourne tonight between military and Police. Several of our officers asked leave to go to St Kilda dancing pavilion. Wanted me to go but I concluded it is no place for an old married man. Instead I walked along Beaconsfield parade from ship to St Kilda and back again – about 6 miles. Left ship at 8 PM and returned at 10 PM. Road very beautiful. Bitterly cold night. On my return to ship I was introduced to a friend of Mr Darcy the 4th officer, I discovered him to be an old Geelong friend (Mr Brown) of 20 years ago.

He told us of the capture of the last German ship to enter Melbourne port and of his \"bluffing\" the skipper that Fort-search lights were only being run for the usual quarterly trials. Dropped Pilot at 6 PM. Arranged details for N.C.Officers classes. Very amusing incidents have come to light re Lieut Jenkinson, a lady admirer or admired and his orderly, and another re an absent gunner when time came to embark, a lady friend and a Sergeant and party sent to bring him aboard. The details hardly suitable for Diary, but the foregoing notes will always suffice to bring the incidents clearly to mind again. The Australian soldier is certainly resourceful.

Other ships arrived during day, so that now only about three transports remain to be accounted for. Work on board ship proceeded as usual, with the exception that gun drill had to be discontinued on account of rain, and for same reason horses on open decks could not be exercised. Very heavy wind and sea and driving rain. Received two long letters from Alvord. Sent off Syllabus of Officers and NCOs of Brigade Training to Bessel-Browne & Waite on board \"Medic.\"(still at Fremantle) Message by wireless from \"Orvieto\" during evening complaining of use of wireless on three ships between Melbourne and Albany, also of floating boxes, etc. Long message also sent by lamp for practice of whole convoy.\n\nWarned for Conference on 27th inst. I personally read the messages from Captains Chart room. \"Orvieto\" light very unsatisfactory. Lamp message afterwards repeated by wireless as a check, but was not satisfactorily received on account of atmospheric disturbance and some shore station commencing to send. Sent a lamp message to Major Burgess on Transport \"Geelong\" enquiring as to health of officers and men. He just commenced a reply but appeared to be cut-off and consequently his message was not completed.\n\nH.M.A.S. Melbourne patrolling the entrance to the Sound.\n\nThe whole scene begins to impress one. – the turbulent water, many ships, cruises, etc – all foretelling serious work in the future.\n\nTuesday 27th October\n\nLast night very rough. \"Katuna\" arrived from Tasmania this morning. As she has a large number of 3rd Brigade horses I shall get in touch with her as soon as possible and ascertain their condition. Units as usual work during morning. Obtained a voluntary boat crew in afternoon to row over to \"Katuna\" and \"Geelong\". Col Sutton accompanied me in order to see his medical details on the \"Geelong\". We had a very rough passage to the \"Katuna\" which lay about a mile\n\nfrom our own ship. We then had to clamber up ship’s rope ladder, no easy task with a heavy sea running. After inspecting the horses we again engineered ourselves back into the boat and rowed over to the \"Geelong\" which is carrying 9th battery from Tasmania. The sea had however risen a good deal and we were unable to get on board. Consequently after a few words with Major Burgess who was waiting for us, we set off from ship, and after a good solid hour and a half’s row arrived safely.\n\nThe boat was leaking a good deal and baling had to be resorted to constantly. One of our crew was very sick, but everybody else appeared to enjoy the experience. Col Sutton and myself feel that after this afternoon’s experience we have no desire to form part of a shipwrecked crew, cast off in ships boats in the open ocean. Both lamp and wireless signals through from \"Orvieto\" during the evening. Conference called for tomorrow on Flag Ship.\n","34":"\n\nUsual routine work for units. Left on launch at 8.30 AM for conference aborad Flag Ship. Owing to calling at the other ships of 3rd Division Flagship was not reached till about 11 AM. Conference had then commenced. The","35":" Brigade returns were correct and in consequence I suffered no adverse criticism. Had lunch on board. Chatted with several officers. Saw the \"Melbourne\" pass and salute the General’s flag. She dropped a boat and sent pipers aboard the Flagship. On the return of the boat to the cruiser it was hoisted into the davits, the crew \"running away\" with the rope to the accompaniment of the Bugles. It was a very pretty sight.\n\nA cinematograph operator took some pictures from the Flag ship.\n\nSaw Olding and Major King on the \"Argyleshire\" as we passed her.\n\nStrict instructions issued re posting of letters and cards and sending of wires. All to be riguorusly censored. In consequence I can only send home Post Cards which must contain no information about the troops, ships, or ports of call. Returned to ship at 6 PM after discharging officers at each ship of Second Division. Lamp and wireless messages during the evening. Took a few signals on the Marconi Instrument. Harbour full of boats. New Zealand Convoy arrived about 11 AM, escorted by H.M.S. Minatour , Philomel and Pyramus, also H.I.J.M. ship \"Ibuki\". The Melbourne led the way into the Sound. The H.M.S. \"Physce\" (Psyche?) also accompanied the Convoy as far as Hobart and then returned to New Zealand. The fleet now at anchor makes a most imposing sight.\n\nLast night the \"Essex\" a steamer from England, entered the Sound, but was promptly \"hove to\" when a shell from the \"Melbourne\" screamed across\n\nher bow. Today ships are watering as fast as local facilities will permit. A New Zealand boat came over to us this morning with several members of New Zealand Rifles on board. They looked to be fine specimens of manhood and their uniforms are of a very suitable colour and material, as well as being well made. We have been expecting the General to make his appearance this morning, but so far he has only reached the \"Argyleshire\".\n\nMajor Hughes has been on the sick list with influenza for three days, but is now on the way to recovery.\n","36":"\n\nAnother message stating that General was to inspect just received this morning. He visited the \"Shropshire\" but afterwards returned direct to his own ship. Our ship had been very nicely prepared. Units at work during day. One horse took ill, suffering from colic, but has much improved. Most definite instructions received re censorship. Boat crew put off to \"Shropshire\" to get kits of three men recently posted to \"Rangatira\". Only one could be found. Reading up afternoon and evening. Received wireless instructing ship to go into harbour for water tomorrow morning.\n","37":"\n\nOrdered Drill Order parade preparatory to moving into Harbour. Left anchorage about 10.30. On passing \"Orvieto\" troops were formed up on deck. Guard presented Arms and Trumpets sounded general Salute. Our flag was dipped to the \"Orvieto\" but she did not respond. On passing H.M.S. \"Minatour\" we repeated the salute and it was immediately acknowledged. After lunch four boat crews went over to a near beach for sand, returning about 4 PM with about 4 tons.\n\nMr Jopp and Duntroon Subaltern left in ships boat for \"Orvieto\". Mr Jopp returned to ship at 12.45. During the afternoon I paid a call on the Captain of the \"Minatour\". The 1st gunnery Lieutenant showed us over the ship. She carries ten 4\".7 and four 9\".2, the latter in pairs, fore and aft. Also several 12 prs. She has just completed 19000 knots since war was declared and is now being repainted.\n\nWe learned we are expected to leave on Sunday for our homeward journey via Colombo. I watched with interest sounding of \"Retreat\" on warship. Went over to Albany township at 4.15 PM and scored about 20 bags of green fodder. Our horses will much appreciate this alteration in menu, though up to date they appear very fit indeed.\n\nDoing one reading tonight – getting ready for lectures on the way home.\n","38":"\n\nSent party on shore to take discharged men to major Meeks at Fort. Completed watering of ship at 10.30 AM. Moved out from Inner Harbour to old Anchorage. Passing \"Minatour\" we lined ship and saluted also dipped the Flag. Salute returned. On passing \"Orvieto\" the Flagship we again saluted but no notice taken. This was the second occasion on which our salute had been ignored.\n\nAll the Transports came out of harbour during the afternoon and took up original moorings. Signalling proceeding during day. Col Hobbs inspected ship during afternoon on behalf of General Bridges. Very satisfactory generally. Posted a number of Post Cards. Letters not being allowed.\n\nSignal received from \"Orvieto\" to the effect that Minister of Defence had wired asking if it was true that troops on board \"Rangatira\" were forced to drink beer for dinner because of shortage of water. I replied that statement was absolutely incorrect.\n\nTook from 9.45 to 12 o’clock midnight to get a reply back to the \"Orvieto\". Reurned at 2 AM. Five boats out during afternoon for sand.\n","39":"\n\nRose at 5 AM Steam had been ordered for 6 AM, and instructions given for the Fleet to be put to sea. It was a most beautiful morning – and a prettier picture I never expect to see than King George’s Sound as it appeared today. The \"Minotaur\" followed by the \"Melbourne\" came out of Inner Harbour at 6AM. The \"Orvieto\" followed, then the 1st Division. The Second and Third followed in proper order, then the New Zealand Convoy, and last of all the \"Sydney\". On next Page is a diagram of the whole Fleet formation. The Medic\" and \"Ascanius\" are not with us, but will take up their places tomorrow on their arrival from Fremantle. Today has been somewhat novel – the various ships officers practising how to \"keep station\" by day and night. The Captain of the \"Benalla\" immediately preceding us is evidently very nervous for he \"backs and fills\" and causes all the following ships of this Division to also lose station. Our signallers are getting excellent practice. The moon is now shining through heavy broken clouds and the whole scene is extremely beautiful.\n\nChurch Service this evening. One of the Corporals of Brigade Column, who in private life is a clergyman and a Queensland chaplain gave the address. It is now 10 o’clock and the wind is piping up. We are nearing the \"Leeuwin\" so must expect fresh weather.\n\n DIAGRAM SHOWING FLEET AT SEA\n\n Australian Convoy\n\n\t\t\t\t H.M.S. \"Minatour\"\n\n 2nd Division - 1st Division - 3rd Division\n\n <---- 1 mile--> - -X- - <-----1 mile ---->\n\n \"Wiltshire\" - \"Orvieto\" - \"Euripides\"\n\n A.18 (103900 - A.3 (12130) - A.14 (15000)\n\n\t\t \"Medic\" - \"Southern\" - \"Argyllshire\"\n\n A.7 (12032) - A.27 (4769) - A.8 (10392)\n\n \"Ascanius\" - \"Pera\" - \"Shropshire\"\n\n A.11 (10049) - A.4 (7635) - A.9 (11911)\n\n \"Star of England\" - \"Armadale\" - \"Afric\"\n\n A.15 (9150) - A.26 - A19 (11999)\n\n \"Geelong\" - \"Saldanah\" - \"Benalla\"\n\n A.2 (7954) - A.12 (4594) - A.24 (11118\n\n H.M.A.S. - \"Port Lincoln\" - \"Katuna\" - \"Rangatira\" - H.I.J.M.S.\"Ibuki\"\n\n \"Sydney\" - A.17 (7243) - A.13 (4641) - A.22 (10018) \n\n \"Karoo\" - \"Hymettus\" - \"Star of Victoria\"\n\n A.10 (6127) - A.1 (4606) - A.16 (9150)\n\n \"Marere\" - \"Suffolk\" - \"Hororata\"\n\n A.21 (6443) - A.23 (75730 - A.20 (9491)\n\n \"Clan MacCorquodale\" - \"Anglo Egyptian\" - \"Omrah\"\n\n A.6 (5121) - A.25 - A.5 (8130)\n\n - \"Miltiades\"\n\n - A.28\n\n New Zealand Convoy\n\n 2nd Division - Ist Division\n\n\t\t \"Arawa\" - \"Maunganui\"\n\n N.Z. 10 - N.Z. 3\n\n\t\t \"Athenic\" - \"Orari\"\n\n N.Z.11 - N.Z. 6\n\n \"Hawkes Bay\" - \"Star of India\"\n\n N.Z. 9 - N.Z.8\n\n \"Ruapehu\" - \"Limerick\"\n\n N.Z. 5 - N.Z.7\n\n\t \"Waimana\" - \"Tahiti\"\n\n N.Z. 12 - N.Z. 4\n\n H.M.A.S. \"Melbourne\"\n","40":"\n\nFresh breeze and confused sea with rain squalls during day. At 6AM all ships reasonably in station. \"Benalla\" caused a good deal of trouble during the night due to excessive alterations of speed. \"Melbourne\" called up \"Benalla\", \"Afric\" and \"Hororata\" during last evening, directing them to keep better station. Units at work during day at physical drill, gun drill, lectures and exercising of horses. All horses are now exercised daily. Read a message from \"Shropshire\" to \"Afric\" apologising for getting out of line, and explaining they did so because they had to throw a horse overboard and evidently wanted it to be clear of propellers of succeeding ships.\n\nOrders re throwing boxes overboard apparently ignored by leading ships of 3rd Division.. Many boxes and other refuse have passed us during the day. Hatch covers removed with a resultant improvement of air condition in lower decks. Inspection at 11 AM proved ship to be well kept.\n\nLt Clowes and Jenkinson with influenza. Both improving.\n","41":"\n\nI am informed this is Cup Day. I suppose we will receive a wireless telling of result as we yesterday received wireless stating that Great Britain had declared war on Turkey. We received wireless today stating that British Cruise \"Hermes\" had been sunk in the Strait of Dover by a German submarine. All units working well. Today special fatigues, cleaning out and disinfecting all horse stalls, also eyes, nose, decks and health of Horses. Strong breeze with heavy confused sea. Ship pitching a good deal. A couple of the officers and some of the men ill. I have experienced not the slightest sensation of sea sickness since leaving Brisbane. Quite a pleasant change for me.\n\nAt 3 PM traces of smoke from \"Medic\" and \"Ascanius\" with their escorts were noticed. The escorts were the Japanese ship \"Ibuki\" and the \"Philomel\". At 4 PM the \"Ascanius\" had taken up her place in convoy, and at 4.30n the \"Medic\" was also in station. The Japanese ship has moved to starboard of the Fleet, the \"Melbourne\" taken up a position astern, the \"Philomel\" has apparently returned to Australia, the \"Sydney\" is on the port beam and the \"Minatour\" is leading the Convoy. During the evening I tried to raise the \"Medic\" which is carrying the 8th Battery and Ammunition Column details, but I could not raise her.\n\nI called up the \"Katuna\" and ascertained that all Artillery horses were in good condition.\n\nDuring the night the \"Benalla\" and \"Afric\" caused great difficulty in Station keeping, so much so that during the middle watch our Division dropped astern of the New Zealand ships. Mr Faulkner, the second officer, who was on watch,\n\nwas much incensed. Thereafter all ships kept better station.\n\nMajor Hughes again taken to bed. He appears far from well.\n\nResult of Melbourne Cup sent through by wireless. Most of the officers joined in a sweep, but a few of us including the Captain did not participate. In fact I do not know the name of winning horse.\n","42":"\n\nUsual routine duties during the day. Marching order inspection carried out. Much improvement. Station keeping better during day. Spent most of day on Bridge learning International Code Signalling and at night sent a long message to Major Bessell Browne on the \"Medic\". The \"Katuna\" reported she had lost 2 horses. So far ours are doing exceedingly well. The Horse decks are beautifully clean and well kept. Weather warming up.\n","43":"\n\nBeautiful morning. A good deal of trouble during night due to faulty station keeping of ships ahead. Gun drill, lectures and physical training going on. About 11 AM the \"Minatour\" came back from her position at the head of Convoy, passed down the lines severely criticising ships which were not keeping station, and returned up the line to her place again. As she passed us our troops fell in on their Parade Stations and we gave the salute. During the afternoon number of Horse casualties in Convoy were transmitted to \"Orvieto\". Fortunately we have so far lost none from Albany. The following are the losses. Pera 1, Katuna 4, Hymettus 3, Anglo Egyptian 5, Medic 1, Port Lincoln 5, Karoo 9, Clan MacCorquedale 7, Marere 9, Shropshire 1. Total 45 . weather very warm today. Our position at noon. 24o 6’ South, 106o 55’ East. All awnings spread much to the satisfaction of all ranks. At 5 PM the \"Osterly\" showed up on the Horizon astern. She attempted to cross our line but the \"Melbourne\" ordered her off. She came up abrEast our line just after we had finished dinner. Our men gave her cheers, and they were very \n\nheartily responded to by the ship. The rigging was full of Blue Jackets evidently on their way to join their ships. She looked very fine steaming past us.\n\nI should have referred to the appearance of the \"Minatour\" as she passed us today. She was ploughing along at about 20 knots with her sailors manning the decks. They and the officers were all dressed in white and with the various signal flags flying she looked a pretty sight.\n\nAs I write 8 bells has just sounded and the Lookout in the bow has called ‘All’s well\". A big crowd of gunners is singing all sorts of songs on the forward deck. They have just finished ‘Absent\". I feel inclined\n\nin consequence never to sing it again. Major Hughes still confined to his bed and our veterinary Officer too is not well today. Influenza appears to be going round the ship.\n","44":"\n\nA dull and cloudy day. Much cooler than yesterday. All the ships officers out in white. They look so nice that we tell them we must have a photograph of them to remind us of our trip home in \"Rangatira\". Special rehearsal today of procedure of Convoy on sighting an enemy. Satisfactorily carried out. All boat stations manned, men wearing life belts, all ports and watertight doors closed, and men discarding boots.\n\nFairly warm in Horse decks – 80o – So far horses in good condition. Station keeping of ships today much improved.\n\nOur position noon today 20o 41’ South 104o 14’ West. Last 24 hours run 250 miles.\n","45":"\n\nA dull overcast day but by far the hottest we have had so far. We found \n\nthe awnings over main Horse deck made the atmosphere very close indeed.\n\nIn consequence we removed part of the forward awnings and rigged four\n\nnew wind sails, beside opening to the full two meal doors on each side of \n\nthe ship. This improved air currents considerably.\n\nGun laying and signalling instruction carried out during day. At night from 8 to 8.30 all lights except stern shaded light were extinguished by order of Flag ship, and troops paraded on parade stations. This as a rehearsal in case of attack at night by an enemy. Most of the ships in convoy implicitly obeyed instructions but some omitted to quench their lights. As a consequence I expect we shall receive a sarcastic wireless tomorrow from the \"Orvieto\". The \"Benalla\" immediately ahead of our ship, as soon as lights were ordered out, veered quite out of the course before complying, and generally made a sorry exhibition. I rather think I should be a little afraid to take along cruise in that ship with its present officers.\n\nReturns from ships showing horses lost since last return (Thursday last) are as follows: - \"Wiltshire\" 1, \"Star of England’ 1, \"Port Lincoln\" 1, \"Karoo\" 1, \"Southern\" 1, \"Armadale\" 1, \"Katuna\" 2, \"Star of Victoria\" 2, Total 10 – making grand total so far of 55 horses since leaving Albany.\n\nWe are drawing near to Cocos Islands, being at noon today 381 miles distant. Our position at 12 today 17o 14’ South, 101o 36’ East. Total run for last 24 hours 255 miles. Then had concert tonight prior to \"attack\"\n\nParade. Exceedingly hot as I write 9.30 PM. Stewards have just brought us cold lemon drinks, which are just the thing now.\n","46":"\n\nAnother very hot day. About 3 PM a heavy rain and wind squall came up, very materially cooling atmosphere and horse decks. Message sent through to Major Bessel-Browne O.C. Troops Medic, re First-aid classes and medical Certificate.\n\nEarly this morning the \"Minatour\" passed down the convoy to the \"Melbourne\", which latter ship was keeping station in rear of convoy. After travelling for about 15 minutes beside the \"Melbourne\" the ‘Minatour\" steered off to the westward and has not since been seen, the \"Melbourne\" taking up position in \"Minatour\" station at head of Convoy. Tonight special orders came through to travel without lights. I am of opinion the \"Minatour\" has received information concerning German ships, and is doing reconnaissance work. \"Afric\" hauled out of line this morning also \"Argyleshire\". It looked as if they were passing horses overboard but we could not see clearly.\n\nAt 10.15 a wireless message came through telling of the death of Private Kendall 5th Battalion on board \"Euripides\". This ship drew out of line at 10.30 and conducted burial Service, all Ensigns being flown half-mast.\n\nI think this is the first Casualty in the A.I. Force.\n\nLecturette this evening by Lieut Urquhart on \"Employment of Artillery\". \n\nChurch service at 7PM. Big attendance and very good singing.\n\nOne of the ship’s crew caught broaching beer. Dealt with by Captain, fined & logged. Last 24 hours travelled 238 miles, leaving about 150 miles to go to \"Cocos Islands\" from noon today. Expect to pass about 3 AM tomorrow morning.\n\nPosition at noon 13o 55’ S, 99o 25’E.\n","47":"\n\nExceptionally hot night. All ships travelled with lights out. Hosing of horse decks carried out every half hour during the night to reduce temperature. Thermometer reading this morning in main Horse deck 85 o\n\nAbout 7 AM the \"Sydney\" whose position has been protecting our port flank, suddenly stoked up and moved very rapidly towards the Cocos Islands. We have no knowledge of any movement of enemy but doubtless will have later. The \"Melbourne\" which yesterday took up position at head on convoy, has now moved over well in advance of the Port Flank of convoy. Battery work as usual. Twenty men as volunteers\n\nassisted the ships crew to work coal from No 4 hold to Bunkers. This will involve about a fortnights work. The Captain has allowed each man a pint of beer per day – and doubtless with the very hot weather his action will be appreciated.\n\nJust before noon both the \"Melbourne\" and \"Ibuki\" bolted off to the westward but returned in about an hours time. In the meantime our wireless operator was listening at his receiver and presently brought us information that the German Cruiser \"Emden\" had been run aground (presumably at Cocos Island) to prevent her sinking, and that the \"Sydney\" was scouting for her merchant colliers. Information was also received that two men had been killed and fourteen wounded in the engagement. \n\nWe do not know which ship accounted for the \"Emden\" but hope it is the \"Sydney\". We expect the ships May return to the Convoy tomorrow and they will certainly receive a rousing reception.\n\nAt 3.15 the \"Euripides\" drew out of the Column and word was received to hoist Ensign half mast. Apparently another of her men has died, but we have received no information concerning the matter.\n\nHorse returns were again rendered today with result as follows;-\n\n\"Karoo\" 1, \"Marere\" 2, \"Armadale\" 1, \"Katuna\" 2, \"Hymettus\" 11, \"Shropshire\" 2, and \"Star of Victoria\" 1. Several ships displayed no signals, so I do not know result. \"Hymettus\" total seems large, but her signals were very clear. Total losses during the last two days according to our readings are therefore 20, which added to previous total makes 75 since leaving Albany.\n\nTotal run up to noon today for last 24 hours 244 miles. Position 10o 38’S 97o 2’E. About 630 miles to line. Expect to cross about noon on Thursday.\n\nLecture tonight to N.C.O.s by Major Hughes. Two more wind sails fitted to Horse deck.\n","48":"\n\nAnother exceedingly hot and trying day. About 1 Am a mare belonging to the AMC gave birth to a foal. She is very frisky this morning and is another addition to ships pets.\n\nWe expect another foal arrival in about a week.\n\nThe second officer and our signallers on watch report that about 3 AM the \"Melbourne\" and \"Ibuki\" rapidly moved forward and later flashes were seen and sounds were heard resembling discharge of ordnance.\n\nAt 11.40 the \"Medic\" drew out of line, and notification came down the Division to hoist Ensign at halfmast. There has evidently been a burial from the \"Medic\", and as she carries mainly artillery the chances are it is one of our men.\n\nTwo horses sick today. Heat is very trying to them. Men are all at work with only a pair of dungaree trousers as covering – Position at noon 8o05’S, 93o46’ East. Mileage 252.\n\nSplendid news came through today re German ship \"Emden\", telling us that H.M.A.S. \"Sydney\" had captured her. I read out the news to the men on Parade, and we all gave lusty cheers.\n\nThe following is a copy of the wireless message officially sent out by the \"Orvieto\".\n\n\"Sydney\" started off for Cocos at 7 AM. At 9.30 she had sighted the enemy. Travelling at full speed she was able to get within range in 20 minutes, at the same time she signalled that the chase was steering north. At 10.45 \"Sydney\" was engaging the enemy briskly and at 11.10 the latter had to beach herself to avoid sinking. Her foremast and three funnels were down but the flag was still flying. \"Sydney\" then went after \"Emdens\" collier, took the crew off and sank her. \"Sydney\" returned again to \"Emden\" who surrendered. The extent and nature of the German casualties are not yet known, but they are bound to be severe. The \"Sydneys\" own casualties required hospital treatment which was promptly found on \"Direction Island\". The \"Emden\" had had time to destroy Wireless Telegraph Station and to cut one of the three cables. A second cable was intact and possibly the third. All the instruments were destroyed excepting one. This had been buried and is in use again. The Wireless Telegraph and Cable operators deserve much praise for sticking to their post, and sending out distress signals, also for saving instruments. \"Sydney\" will sail for Colombo as soon as she has succeeded in getting German wounded and prisoners on board. The operation May take 24 hours as it presents considerable difficulty.\"\n\nNaturally such a message (received 1.30 PM) has given us food for conversation. We are all delighted the \"Sydney\" has done such good work and acquitted herself so well.\n\nThe following are censorship arrangements for Colombo. All mails from A.I.F. Transports will be sent to \"Orvieto\" for censorship. Open letters, plain post cards and urgent telegrams will be passed by Censor for immediate despatch provided all references to ships, places and date are omitted. Closed letters and parcels will be delayed.\n\nThis afternoon we noticed one of the New Zealand ships stop and lower a boat. The \"Ibuki\" steamed off rapidly in her direction, but presently we saw the boat again hauled up into the Davits. Presumably a\n\nman fell overboard but was promptly rescued.\n\nTerribly hot tonight. By far the worst night we have had yet. Not a movement in the air.\n","49":"\n\nAgain a very hot day, but cool breeze sprang up during afternoon. Men at physical drill, laying & semaphore. Artificers dismantling and cleaning third gun.\n\nReceived wireless pointing out that \"Emden passed within 20 miles of us on Sunday night, and complained that some masters were not careful enough in darkening ship\".\n\nArranged that mens ration of meat should be reduced and stewed fruit provided in lieu thereof, chilled in cooling chambers.\n\nLime juice brought out of No 5 hold and made available for troops.\n\nThis afternoon \"Ascanius\" dropped out of line for burial service. This makes the fourth death on the journey from Albany. I think in each case cause of death has been pneumonia supervening on Influenza. About 200 men inoculated against typhoid. I received our first injection tonight. Some of the N.C.O.s refuse to be done, but I think I shall be able to overcome their prejudices.\n\nOne horse very sick tonight. I am afraid we shall lose him before morning. Today’s horse casualty list is as follows: - \"Wiltshire\" 1, \"Port Lincoln\" 2, \"Karoo\" 2, \"Marere\" 1, \"clan MacCorquodale\" 2, \"Armadale\" 2, \"Shropshire\" 1, \"Star of Victoria\" 1, making a total to date of 95 lost.\n\nPosition at noon today 5o25’S, 90o39’E, run for 24 hours 247 miles.\n\nSlept on deck last night, roused about 2 AM by heavy thunder and rain storm, had to shift to more secluded part of deck.\n\nThursday 12th November\n\nFelt very restless during last night on account of inoculation. Went up on Bridge at 3 AM and read some signal messages. At early dawn \"Orvieto\", \"Melbourne\" and \"Ibuki\" conferred on our flank. Later the \"Melbourne\" bade farewell and steamed off.\n\nPrior to leaving she sent the two following messages;-\n\n\"Captain of \"Melbourne\" to Commander and Officers of Convoy. \"Melbourne\" is ordered on other service. On leaving the Australian Convoy with which I have been connected since it first began to move I hope I May be forgiven for any criticisms I have signalled from time to time. Such signals have only been made with a view to the efficient development of this great organisation, and the safety resulting therefrom. I fully understand the difficulties that\n\nhave to be overcome in ships which have no facilities for station keeping, or darkening ship. I am equally certain that the zeal and cooperation of Bridge and Engine room will overcome them, and safely leave the splendid body of men that has been entrusted to them. I wish you \"farewell\" and \"good luck’.\n\nThe Second message read. \"I hope to hear that the Third Division will continue to keep up its good reputation for keeping such good station. I thank them for having done their utmost in this respect. Good bye, Good luck\".\n\nAs she steamed past us with her flags showing \"Goodbye\", \"Good luck\", we signalled our thanks and Goodbye. The Orvieto signalled \"Advance Australia\". The \"Ibuki\" then proceeded to take up her station at head of Convoy, she being the only man’o’war with us. We expected the \"Sydney\" might have caught us up today from the Cocos with German prisoners and wounded, but perhaps she has gone direct to Colombo. At lunch time a big three funnelled armoured merchantman (we think it was \"The Empress of Asia\") passed us and signalled \"Good luck\". With the exception of the \"Osterly\" this is the only vessel we have seen in our run from Albany.\n\nSick horse died last night. Post mortem this morning showed it had died from Pnuemonia. This is our first loss since Albany, but we have all done our best and could not save the animal.\n\nThis is the day Alvord commences his exam for entrance to Australian Navy. I wish I could send him a helpful cable.\n\nToday the \"Hororata\" signalled she had 80 cases of measles on board. We luckily have so far had nothing really serious on our ship.\n\nOur position at noon today 2o26’S, 87o38’E days run 255 miles. We had from noon a run of 195 miles to the Equator.\n\nFeel very \"groggy\" today as a result of inoculation Very severe headache and strong local reaction in the side and under the arms. \n\nHope to be fit tomorrow. Preparation being made for \"Crossing the Line\" sports tomorrow. Understand some of the officers are to be victims. Another horse apparently very sick. Horse decks much cooler. There was a good fresh breeze last night and it has continued through the day.\n\nFriday 13th November\n\nFully recovered from effects of inoculation. A second battery horse died suddenly during the night. The Post mortem showed Pnuemonia to be the cause of death. This morning another Man’o’war appeared in view. It was the \"Hampshire\". She took up position leading Convoy and the \"Ibuki\" took up her old position on \"Starboard\" beam.\n\nAt 8 o’clock we received orders to proceed in rear of the New Zealand Convoy \n\nand the \"Anglo Egyptian\" and \"Karoo\" of 1st Division also received similar orders. The New Zealand Fleet with our three boats is moving ahead to Colombo to get in early re watering arrangements etc. As we passed the \"Shropshire\" I sent a message to Colonel Hobbs informing him that our losses in horses was 2. He replied to the effect that we had done very well. Received message from Flagship prohibiting all leave at Colombo.\n\nWe crossed the \"line’ about 7.30 AM. Gave all ranks half holiday for ceremonies incidental to the occurrence. At 2 o’clock we found a large canvas tank rigged up and filled with salt water. The \"Bosun\" as \"Father Neptune\" came Forth properly attired and with him Doctors, barbers & assistants with their huge combs, scissors and razors also shaving bucket and brush. Headed by Bugles and Kettle drum, they paraded the ship, followed by about 12 stalwart policemen. Presently we saw Capt leslie being led Forth for initiation, then several other officers including my adjutant Colonel Sutton. All took the proceedings in good part excepting one Army medical man who fought vigorously, and in consequence got a more severe ducking than if he had acquiesced at once. Rain fell during the day but did not spoil the proceedings except for the fact that no photo could be taken.\n\nAltogether the men had a good day, finishing up with a concert at night. I sang a few songs and played some accompaniment for the men.\n\nStrict orders again received re censorship of mail matter at Colombo. As we are steaming faster than the main convoy we should be well out of their sight by daylight. The \"Hampshire\" is with us and the \"Ibuki\" with the rest of the Convoy.\n\nNearly all men inoculated. A few still object but I think they will fall in line tomorrow. Run to 12 noon today 260 miles. Position Oo44’N, 84o41’E. New Zealand Convoy disregarding order re floating materials. I counted 27 boxes afloat today, a number I actually saw thrown overboard from the \"Waimana\", the ship immediately ahead of us.\n\nSaturday 14th November\n\nAlmost out of sight of Australian Convoy at dawn. Have not gained much on them. The \"Waimana\" dropped a horse overboard this morning making their total 7. Balance of men inoculated today. About 30 refused and were placed under arrest for disobedience of orders. At 5PM I had them all paraded, told them of the advantage of inoculation and then ordered them to go to the Hospital for treatment. All but one refused. I therefore called a guard of 40 men, and ordered two men to compulsorily take the first man in. When they found I was determined to be obeyed they \"caved in\".\n\nHowever I kept the guard standing by till all had been done, then I dismissed the Guard and gave the culprits a good talking to.\n\nHave had all the officers tonight on \"Sketching\". I am afraid some that were handed in were very primitive.\n\nHorses making a big noise just before feeding tonight, and many were neighing. Mr Faulkner, second officer, referred to it as \"shouting\". The Captain was today watching horses exercising on deck and one animal on nearing an iron bollard put one leg on one side and another leg on the other side.\n\n\"Look\" said he \"that horse has got his after starboard leg on this side of the bollard and his after port leg on the other side.\" Everybody roared with laughter. Rifle practice today.\n\nWrote post-cards to Father & Mother, Alvord and Chris ready for posting tomorrow. We are now nearing Colombo. Expect to reach there about 8.30AM tomorrow. I then am ordered ashore to make arrangements at transport Office, Saddlers and Chemist Shops for Australian Convoy’s requirements. Expect to have about 3 hours ashore.\n\nStrong gale has just blown up (10PM) Very heavy wind but – no sea. Run to noon today 248 miles. Position 3o54’N, 82o1’E. \n\nSunday 15th November\n\nArrived off Colombo about 9 AM. The Pilot came off to some of the New Zealand fleet first and we had some time to wait. At 10.30 the \"Sydney\" hove in sight together with the \"empress of Russia\" not of \"Asia\" as I previously stated. She was carrying German prisoners and wounded. We had received instructions that there must be no demonstration, and much against our wishes we had to agree. However I hoisted Flag Signals meaning \"new South Wales Congratulates you\" to which the \"Sydney\" replied \"thank you\". We lined up our troops on deck, gave the salute, and dipped the Ensign.\n\nAt 11 AM I went ashore in a ships boat with the Adjutant and Capt McGee. The latter took with him a gunner who had an accident the previous day with his false teeth and required dental treatment. I called at transport Office, Times Office and Post Office on official business. Then we waited at the jetty and saw the wounded landed from the \"Sydney\".\n\nThe German wounded were landed in the afternoon. It made a big lump come into my throat to see our lads. Some badly wounded, amputated limbs, burns, etc. It brought home the horrors of war to us. With the exception of those who were very seriously wounded and were \n\nin evident extreme pain, the remainder were very jolly and apparently happy. I only hope the Government will adequately provide for those who are mutilated. At 1 o’clock we went to the G.O.H. for lunch and when nearly finished Capt McGee looked in. \"I am very glad to find you here Colonel\" he said. \"I want a little extra leave.\" He then proceeded to explain that Dr Smith (who came in with him) was a dentist who had recommended him to a brother dentist in a small way of business, who would do his gunners’ dental work at a cheap figure. In addition he drove Capt McGee in his car to this dentist’s residence about 11\/2 miles out, near the Cinnamon Gardens. The necessary dental work could not be completed till evening so Capt McGee wanted more leave. This I granted. Dr Smith then invited Mr Jopp and myself to go out with him after lunch in his car. At 2.30 we left the G.O.H., went to the R.A. Mess and left cards, then on to the Galle Face Hotel, thence on to Mount Lavinia, returning to the jetty at 5PM. We there met our Ships Captain who took us to afternoon tea. The motor drive was most enjoyable. The beautiful palms, narrow roads, oxen, Cingalese men, women and children, the beautiful foliage and fine bungalows made a very pleasing impression.\n\nI much admire the beautiful copper coloured skin of the Cingalese men, many of whom are a fine type. The little children are very quaint and pretty. Dr Smith invited me when returning to Australia to look him up again. Capt McGee stayed to dinner with him, and I have chaffingly told him that if he can pick up a similar friend in every port of call, with a car to place at our disposal, we will get some false teeth smashed at regular intervals.\n\nOn the way back to the Ship we called at the \"Sydney\". I left cards and had a few minutes chat with Lieut Bell Satter of Sydney. He told us the \"Emden\" put 11 shots into them, her first two being fired at a range of 11000 yards. The Germans lost 112 killed, about 80 wounded and the rest prisoners, except 40 who were destroying the Wireless Station when engagement commenced and appropriating a schooner on the other side of Cocos Island, got away. The Kaiser’s nephew is a prisoner. I wish I could have participated in this engagement. Our fellows deserve all praise. Colombo is a very beautiful spot. The breakwater has made a good harbour and there are about 40 anchorage buoys. The Convoy has of course filled up the whole roadstead. In addition to the Russian 5 funnel \"Askold\" and the Japanese \n\n\"Ibuki\" there are also innumerable small steamers, schooners, Arab Dhows, and all sorts of small craft at Catamaran. We saw about 20 of these latter at Mt Lavinia drawn up on the Sandy Beach. The buildings are very good, and the natives in their many coloured but scanty dress, and the rickshaws make a splendid picture. I could spend a week here very easily indeed.\n\nThe \"Anglo Egyptian\" is moored alongside us and we have transferred 50 tons of chaff from the ship to ours. About half of it is very wet, heated and fermented and will be practically of no use.\n\nMonday 16th November\n\nAwakened at 6 AM by firing of two sunrise guns in quick succession. About 1.30 AM this morning Capt McGee came aboard in a greatly disturbed state of mind. His gunner had failed to be at the G.O.H. at the appointed time and he had to return alone to the ship. To make matters worse the launch which brought him off did not know where our ship was lying and he had an hours search in the Anchorage before he reached home. I told him to take a boat’s crew ashore early this morning and find the missing lad. Later they returned with him, and it transpired he had been at the Hotel the whole evening, so I informed Capt McGee that it was apparent his Doctor friend’s dinner had been too good, and in consequence his vision must have been affected.\n\nWe drew off from the \"Anglo Egyptian\" about 8.30 AM. I left at that time with a boat’s crew, visited the \"Medic\", met Major Bessel Browne and the Officers of the 8th Battery, then on to the \"Geelong\" to meet the officers of the 9th Battery, then on to \"Katuna\" to see 9th Battery Horses. Major Hughes, Mr Jopp and Capt McLennan accompanied me. Returned to \"Rangatua\" at 12.30 at her anchorage in the roads. Early this morning some Cingalese came aboard selling papers. One of them in some way was left on the boat and is now in a great state of mind as to whether he will ever get ashore again. Have just received wireless informing me that 1st and","50":" Divisions are to leave tomorrow at 11 AM and our Division will leave at 6PM. They will thus get about 70 miles start of us. We expect to go into harbour early for water. Sent off a boat’s crew tonight with letters for \"Orvieto\" but owing to a strong current they were unable to\n\nget more than ½ a mile from our ship in over an hours rowing, so they returned, taking only 7 minutes.\n\nThe Port is a beautiful sight tonight. The town and shipping lights also all the signalling lamps at mast heads making it very gay in effect.\n","51":"\n\nUnits at work as usual. Lieut Urquhart Ross and Clowes and Capt McLennan went ashore in launch. I asked them to get me a few photo frames of Eastern design, for my family photos in my cabin, but they brought me back Common English frames. Launch brought off a big supply of cocoanuts, oranges and bananas. Cingalese returned to shore. Sent letter to \"Orvieto\" by Capt Matson, who had called in a launch to deliver veterinary requirements. Second and Third Divisions of Convoy together with New Zealand ships left Port at 10 AM. The \"Hampshire\" escorted them. We left at 7 PM escorted by the \"Ibuki\". We are now formed into two divisions of which the second is led by our ship. We expect to overtake the main convoy in about 36 hours. Beautifully cool today. Horse decks have much benefited. All horses so far well. Search lights from forts playing round harbour tonight and shipping illuminated makes a pretty sight. Quite a number of fishing boats out around the fleet. Another stage of our long journey entered upon.\n","52":"\n\nWhen I appeared at the Bridge at 7AM this morning, India was showing up on our starboard bow. The mountains appeared very high and rugged and capped with clouds. I can at lEast say I have seen India. Spent the morning preparing ranging model. After lunch a number of the Officers had some practise on it. We have now taken up station as leader of Second portion of Third Division. It means a big relief to our Ships Officers. As I write at 8.30 PM a cluster of electric lights is burning on main deck. Some of the men are dancing to music supplied by an Accordeon, some are card playing and some reading. All are in their pyjamas for it is a close night. The sea has been as still and smooth as glass today, and the sunset this evening was particularly fine.\n\nHave just been in Signal Communication with Col Hobbs. He tells me he has lost 8 horses. We are fortunate for so far we have only lost four. I asked Major Christian how he was getting on with his horses, but I cannot get a reply. We are now travelling in two lines of 5 ships each with the \"Ibuki\" leading us. Horses are making an awful row through the ship. They are fed at 9 o’clock and well they know it. They stamp and whinney for some time prior to feeding. Attended Battery N.C.Os lecture tonight. Position at noon 7o45’N, 76o 44’E. days run 191 miles.\n","53":"\n\nUnits at work at Usual Parades. Arranged ranging model for work during afternoon. Made use of Director and Landscape drawing for Officers class in sketching. Ranging during the afternoon with all officers. Myriads of flying fish about the boat all day. Smoke visible ahead of main convoy. Plenty of boxes and other debris floating past us, clearly indicating the path traversed by previous ships. Had a game of bridge tonight with Captain Jopp and Colonel Sutton. This afternoon commenced rehearsal with Double Quartette party. Some very fair voices.\n\nAttended Lieut Urquharts lecture at night. Days run to noon 268 miles. Position at noon 8o58’N, 72o23’E.\n","54":"\n\nAt daylight Australian Convoy and New Zealand Convoy about 15 miles ahead. Lead column formation retained.\n\nSquads at signalling, gun laying, fuze setting, etc. Arranged model range. Ranging in afternoon for all officers.\n\nOral exam for all the N.C.O.s\n\n\"Afric\" which has fallen behind ordered to change places with \"Ascanius\". We are now travelling at 13 knots and have just passed main portion of Australian Convoy. Our orders in this Division are to proceed to Aden to coal, and I understand we are then to steam straight home. As this Division can do 13 knots we should reach England about a week ahead of main Convoy.\n\nPosition at noon 10o8’N, 68o0’E. Mileage 269\n","55":"\n\nAt daylight our Convoy was very mixed up owing to the fact that during the night a collision had occurred between \"Ascanius\" and \"Shropshire\". We had to wait some time for them and in consequence the main Australian Convoy had overtaken us. Tonight we are again well ahead, and the Australian Convoy is out of Sight astern.\n\nRanging during afternoon. Details of all units at work during morning. \"Washing\" afternoon for the men. Very good concert tonight of about eighteen items. The Captain attended with our officers. Capt McLennan gave us a splendid recitation. He is a \"dark horse\".\n\nMade arrangements for issue to each O.C. Unit of Red Cross goods. Run to noon today 289 miles. Position 11o17’N, 63o14’E.\n","56":"\n\nAll units at Stables and Signallers on Bridge. Ranging with officers. Church Service in evening. Beautiful day, again innumerable flying fish. Wrote to Nell and the boys also Father and Mother. Received wireless that letters to Australia from Aden would not be subject to censorship. Run to noon today 298 miles. Position 12o23’N. 58o17’E.\n","57":"\n\nRun today 298 miles. Position 13o11’N, 53o16’E. Very warm day. Signallers, Gun layers, and gun detachments at work. Ranging for officers. Had a game of bridge with Captain, Col Sutton and Capt Dixon. Horses in splendid Condition.\n","58":"\n\nToday’s run 290 miles. Position at noon 12o57’N, 48o19’E. Was finally inoculated for typhoid, together with a number of officers. All units at work including Physical exercises. Coaling nearing Completion. Very hot day. Numbers of flying fish again seen also porpoises. An Arab Dhow passed us in early morning in full sail and made a very pretty sight. Fleet slowed down a little so as to reach Aden not before daylight tomorrow.\n","59":"\n\nArrived off Aden at 5 o’clock. I went up on the Bridge at 5.30 and remained there till we anchored about 8 o’clock. A very rugged group of cliffs marks both sides of the Entrance to Port, rocks appearing to be volcanic. The whole country is exceedingly desolate. A large number of Imperial transports are in harbour, evidently having taken home Indian troops, and now returning empty. The H.M.A.S. \"Sydney\" was also in Port. She left after us at Colombo, and must have passed us during our first night out.\n\nAs we entered Port she steamed away at a good speed in the direction of Perim. We delivered our mails during the morning to H.M.S. \"Hampshire\", going over with the Captain in one of the Ships boats, and returning to the \"Rangatua\" at 1 PM.\n\nAden looks a very forlorn spot. No signs of vegetation. Groups of buildings, Forts, Signal stations and Clock tower were all the points of interest visible from our anchorage. As we did not go inside we could not see the inner harbour. Felt a little seedy after inoculation.\n\nReceived through Courtesy of local agents of \"Rangatua\", files of Reuters cables, and Orvieto also sent me a full account of the \"Emden\" fight. After dinner I assembled all the officers in the Smoke room and read the news out to them.\n\nWe are under orders to leave Aden at 6AM tomorrow. Numbers of boats have been around us today endeavouring to do business with their wares.\n","60":"\n\nWeighed anchor at 5.30AM, ships got into station during the next hour and about 7AM we got a fair move off from Aden.\n\nThe Japanese Man o’ War \"Ibuki\" which acted as escort from Australia is going no further, and last night a message of thanks was sent to her captain from \"Orvieto\". This morning as we passed her she was flying several groups of flags which on reference to International Code read as follows: - \"I wish you further victories. Goodbye.\". We now only have the \"Hampshire\" with us, a ship somewhat about the size of \"Sydney\" or \"Melbourne\".\n\nWe have passed several British Transports today returning to India.\n\nI received a message from the \"Katuna\" today stating that they had lost 12 horses since leaving Tasmania, five of which belonged to the third F.A. Brigade. I am now waiting to receive a message as to losses on the \"Medic\". Our losses so far since leaving Melbourne total four. Colonel Everett of the \"Star of England\" informed me they had lost 14 horses on their ship.\n\nThe Arabian coast and Country beyond is absolutely void of vegetation and appears to consist of nothing but rock and sand. We reached Perim at about 4 PM, and it too appears a desolate place. The Signal Station and Coaling station, also I believe a British Garrison are the only evidence of life. A Russian vessel entered the Port just as we passed. Just before reaching Perim we passed some very prominent peaks right on the coast line, with what appeared to be mud houses built upon the slopes, one particular cottage being right at the summit of the highest peak.\n\nDuring the night we passed Moccha and islands in the Red Sea. All lights are extinguished, being controlled by Turkey. \n\nExceedingly hot day but evening fairly cool with good breeze.\n","61":"\n\nThis morning early we passed Jebel Tir with its Lighthouse. New Zealand transports now out of sight ahead. Four British Transports passed us today returning to India, removal of coal to bunkers completed after about three weeks work, but as the ship provided a midday pint of beer for all workers in the coal, I am of opinion the job has been unduly drawn out. Gun layers and fuze setters at work, also signallers. Exceedingly hot and trying day, by far the worst we have had so far. I spent the morning reading but found it very hard work owing to the heat. During the afternoon made use of the Plasticine model to illustrate method of supplying Ammunition in the Field. Capt McGee and Lieut Jenkinson representing D.A.C. and B.A.C. respectively dealt with their particular units, and Capt Leslie dealt with Battery Ammunition Supply.\n\nCol Sutton then followed with a description of the method of evacuation of wounded from field of Battle, and illustrated lecture on the model. While this lecture was in progress the \"Orvieto\", \"Geelong\", and \"Hampshire\" steamed ahead. The \"Geelong\" lowered a boat which apparently went to the \"Orvieto\". It rather looks as if a Court Martial was being held. Just as the sun was setting the \"Orvieto\" & \"Hampshire\" \n\nwhich were by then some distance in rear, moved ahead again, but the \"Geelong\" is still a long way in rear. As one of my Battery Commanders is on the \"Geelong\" I will doubtless hear full details later.\n\nTomorrow afternoon the ship is to have a series of sports events. Tonight the boxing events were concluded. We had a group of electric lights and the men were arranged around as in an amphitheatre. Major Hughes was Referee. Jopp and Clowes judges, and McClennan time keeper. All seemed to thoroughly enjoy the evening, but I can see no fun or pleasure in boxing.\n\nWhile these events were in progress we afterwards ascertained that a private message had been sent through from \"Shropshire\" stating that she was to draw out of line at 8 o’clock for a burial. We do not know who has died, officer or man, but it is doubtless an artilleryman. Night terribly hot. Captain assures us we shall only have a couple of days hot weather to face and then the weather will gradually pass through cool to cold. We are now in proper Convoy formation, all ships being together. As I write several officers have come into the smoke room, all in pyjamas for our 9.30 drink of cold lime juice. It is very acceptable these nights. We have now had a lime juice issue daily since nearing Colombo. Most of us sleep out on the deck at night.\n","62":"\n\nAnother terribly trying day. Temperature in horse deck up to 100o. If this is Red Sea winter I can duly appreciate the fact that it was not our misfortune to come on this journey with horses during the Summer Season. Rather an \"off\" day. Ordinary routine work and drill during the morning. Sports in the afternoon. Just before men’s midday meal a series of tug of war contests took place, the units providing teams being Head Quarters, battery (2 teams) B.A.C. and D.A.C. (the AAM.C for some inexplicable reason held out of all sports). The D.A.C. team proved to be winner with the Head Quarters team \"runner up\". During the afternoon sports of all kinds were held - Potato race, Alarm & Obstacle races, Rooster in the ring, Sling the monkey, etc, also the finals of the tugs of war, and a special match between Officers and Sergeants. I was anchor man for the officers. We won, much to the disgust of the Sergeants. At night the men had a very good concert. While at dinner at night Capt McGee of\n\nthe D.A. Column, made a statement to the effect that their \"anchor man\" in the winning Tug of War was the most powerful man on the Ship. He weighs 17 stone 3 lbs and is a hefty farmer. I could not stand this, so there and then issued a challenge to pull him after the concert at night. This raised no end of excitement in the Dining Salon. However Capt McGee at once went out, consulted his man (generally known as \"Tiny\") and coming back notified his acceptance of the Challenge. Then betting commenced. Some of our officers backed me, while two officers of the D.A.C. and the Chief Engineer backed \"Tiny\". After the concert we set to work, and I proved to be the winner by the best two out of three pulls. For a few moments I was quite a hero, and am now acknowledged the \"strong\" man of the ship.\n\nDuring the morning we received a wireless message notifying that instructions had been received for Troops to go to Cairo in Egypt for final training, and from there proceed direct to the Front. Under these circumstances we do not know how long it will be before we see England – if ever. The \"Orvieto\" has gone on ahead and the \"Euripides\" now leads the Convoy. Yesterday’s return for horses showed about 9 deaths since previous return. Fortunately no losses on our ship, Medic or Katuna, which carry artillery horses.\n","63":"\n\nA much cooler day. Early this morning a strong breeze arose, which has cooled the horse decks and ship generally very much indeed. We heard today that a death had occurred on the \"Suffolk\", one of the ships crew having succumbed to heat. This makes six deaths during the voyage. Measles broke out on our ship yesterday, two cases being isolated from the D.A.C. They had evidently carried infection from Broad Meadows camp in Melbourne, where they were stationed during our delay in Melbourne. As a consequence we are now faced with the problem of disinfecting all clothing, blankets, etc of all troops on board. In view of the fact that we expect to land either at Port Said or Alexandria we shall not have much time. This will very much interfere with our training, particularly that for first aid which had been arranged for the last fortnight at sea prior to reaching England. This latter instruction will now have to be given when we reach camp. Church Service this evening.\n","64":"\n\nA howling wind blowing all night. Today \n\nwe have had an exceedingly strong head wind with plenty of \"White Horses\". Great drop in temperature about 25o. Marching order inspection of all units today in view of early disembarkation. Two horses bad with Colic last night. Improved this morning. Ships boats swung inboard in preparation for Suez canal. Fumigation continued today. One more case of measles. Commenced packing of Head Quarters stores, Completed checking of Harness of all units. Mr Jenkinson’s hopelessly mixed. Red Cross issues made to all units. Wrote special letter to Nell. Tonight roaring winds and heavy sea. Most beautiful sunset behind the African hills just as we entered the Gulf of Suez. Mount Sinai ranges showing up prominently in Arabia. All ships are now proceeding in Single line. All told about 20 miles in length. Expect to reach Suez before lunch tomorrow. Run to noon today about 250 miles.\n","65":"\n\nReached Suez about 8.30 AM. Though very desolate the Country looked very picturesque in the morning Sunlight. Harbour full of ships. Trading boats at once surrounded all ships and I am sure cleaned out all the last week’s pay of men on our ship. water taken in about 60 tons. Received instructions to disembark at Alexandria and to proceed through canal this evening. Also instructed to have armed guard posted on ship to reply to possible hostile fire from banks of Canal. Accordingly 56 men have been armed and posted to positions. In addition two 18prs have been made ready on deck on suitable bearings of sandbags. If required they will certainly be used. I had a photo taken this afternoon of all military and Ships officers on the ship. I hope they turn out successfully. This afternoon all new Zealand Ships and two men o’ war entered the canal and tonight X Division with a couple of W Division are going through. As I write the \"Wiltshire\" is ahead of us in the Canal, and the \"Argyleshire\" and \"Shropshire\" following – all have their electric search lights. The Pilot of this ship who is a Frenchman has just informed me he has been Piloting on the Canal for 27 years, yet this is the first ship he has ever taken from Suez to Ismailia. He always works from Ismailia to Port Said in Suez, returning to Ismailia by train. Plenty of cheering along the bank from workmen on the Canal. Tomorrow 30 Troop ships are due at Suez from India. We expect to reach Port Said about 11 tomorrow. No chance to post letters today. \n","66":"\n\nArrived at Port Said at 8.33 AM. Just 13 hours less 1 minute from Suez. Almost a record run. I am informed when the King visited Delhi his ship took 13 hours, which was up to then a record trip. The journey through the Canal proved very interesting. On the left Bank the fresh water canal runs, and has a fair amount of vegetation on its banks. On the right bank there is nothing but a desolate waste. We had no occasion to use firearms during our journey through the Canal. Troops lined the banks, mostly Indian and Egyptian to the extent of 35,000, and on the Right (East) Bank the Country has been flooded from the sea to a distance of 15 miles inland by 8 mile wide. This makes an effective barrier against invasion from Arabian territory. We saw innumerable flocks of pelicans and flamingos. As we neared Port Said an armoured train passed us, carrying troops, evidently for the canal. As we arrived at Port Said a veritable hive of industry opened up before us. The New Zealand transports had arrived ahead of us, and with innumerable other ships all coaling, and several French and British Man o War (among the latter being the \"Swiftsure\") made a very busy scene. We were anchored just off the Custom House. The Anchorage is full of trading boats and presents a very lively scene indeed. We are taking in coal and water here. The French Men O War are carrying Hydroplanes for use in the Canal Zone. We moored our vessel about 10.30 AM. Immediately surrounded by native trading boats. Coaling operations commenced. It was exceedingly interesting to watch how this work was carried out by natives and how rapidly it was done. During the afternoon Colonel Sutton, Capt McLennan, Mr Jopp and myself pulled off to the \"Orvieto\" regarding certain returns, etc. Walter Hounain came on board to same from \"Maunganui\". He is electrician on board. He told me an A.M.C. officer was killed in the \"Neptune\" celebrations through diving into shallow tank. I have been informed that this evening we go to an anchorage some distance outside canal, so have arranged for all officers to go ashore this evening returning by launch later to steamer. Visited several ships and walked round the town generally. Much interested in the market quarter. Peculiar trams, many donkeys, persistent guides and hawkers. At 9.30 found we could not get our launch. Nearly all have been commandeered and are being used as river boats fitted with maxims. We could only arrange with the \"Ports and Lights’ office to go aboard the \"Swiftsure\". I obtained copy of November navy list (from the Consular Officer) which\n\nshows Charley posted to H.M.S. \"Charybdis\", and also date of posting, etc. We all stayed the night at the \"Eastern Exchange Hotel\" and had a good look through newspaper files available in the Reading room.\n","67":"\n\nReached Customs House landing place at 6.45 AM. Took boat on to the \"Swiftsure\". While waiting for the Torpedo boat we were shown all over the vessel. At 7.30 we left in Torpedo boat, had an interesting run through the Shipping at about 15 Knots, called at a Picket Torpedo boat doing duty outside, and then headed for the \"Rangatua\". We had an interesting time while reaching our ship. The boat plunged into the waves and rolled very much. Many of us got a wetting. When we reached our ship it was impossible to get alongside owing to the heavy swell, consequently our ship lowered a boat. The 4th Officer took charge with an Artillery crew. Gradually the Torpedo boat got alongside the Ships boat, and the fun commenced. As each big roller came along the Torpedo boat bumped the ships boat alarmingly. One by one we jumped off one boat into the other, and just as we were all off there came a particularly big roller which mixed us up a little, and dashed the Torpedo boat against us, stoving in the side, and in consequence we shipped a great deal of water. Gradually we got back to the \"Rangatua\", and we had a difficult task to get to the davit falls. These hooked we were hauled up clear of the water, and then got aboard per medium of a rope ladder. Capt McGee was greatly excited, was sure we were going to sink and as soon as he saw the Ships rope ladder within reach, he shinned up first at a great turn of speed. He much resented my remark later, when I observed he was first up the ladder, and wanted to know if I questioned his courage.\n","68":"\n\nStill at anchor. We do not yet know when we will be leaving here for Alexandria, but expect it will be tomorrow or Sunday. Assistant wireless Operator left ship this morning to be returned to Australia. The Ship’s captain also went off in a Torpedo boat. This boat returned about 4.30 PM, and dropped Captains of several Transports at anchor. While sea was very smooth in the morning when they left, it was very rough when they returned, and as a consequence our Captain had a hard job getting back to his ship. The Torpedo boat could not safely come along side so a boat had to be lowered. The Captain and crew \n\nhad eventually to scramble up a ships ladder hung over the side, and the boat was left astern till morning when perhaps the sea will be smoother. Many Transports here waiting for orders. The \"Argyleshire\" is just behind us with all the N.S.W. Artillery. Another horse foaled tonight, quite an unexpected arrival. As we are so near to disembarkation the foal had to be destroyed. As I write one of the gunners is playing an Accordeon on the deck, and the crowd is singing all sorts of songs. Have been sorting my clothes today and packing same. Wrote letter to Charley and John Halford and had same taken ashore. Units at work at Gundrill, laying, Semaphore, and rifle exercises. Now getting all gear sorted up ready for going ashore. Most glorious sunset this evening at about 4.45. Days are very short and nights quite cold. A marked contrast to the Red Sea.\n","69":"\n\nDull and wet morning, clearing off in afternoon. Two New Zealand ships returned here today from Alexandria, having disembarked their troops. They are apparently returning to New Zealand. Heard yesterday of loss of H.M.S. Bulwark. On looking through the navy list today I notice that eleven cadets who belonged I think to Charley’s term went down on her, and another 10 in the Monmouth. We are all preparing on board ship for packing. Units getting their blankets and camp equipment (also landing ration) ready. We shall be very glad to finish the journey. We are still anchored here but on present appearances expect to leave tomorrow evening. Again a beautiful red sunset, enhanced by the movement of two hydroplanes passing over our ships and being silhouetted against the evening sky. Chief Steward arranged a special dinner tonight. He did things very well indeed. I have given him letters to his own Company and Shaw Savill, telling them of the satisfactory carrying out of his duties.\n\nA chorus just outside the Smoke room is singing \"It’s a long long way to Tipperary\", and others singing \"It’s along long way to Sunny Queensland\". All seem very happy and anxious to get to serious work.\n","70":"\n\nAnother very nice day. Early this morning the 10 Australian transports here moved anchorage to allow Indian transports to take up our old position. Nine came out of port today. A French Hydroplane has been circling over us this morning and afternoon, once or twice coming down on to the water.\n\nI had Major Bessell Browne, Major Burgess and Capt Waite to lunch. Discussed many matters with them. Reduced to ranks two of major Burgess’ men for drunkenness. Officers returned to their respective ships at 5PM. Church service this evening. Band performing on the \"Geelong\" near by. Music sounded very nice coming over the water. Major Burgess is to visit our ship again in the morning re further disciplinary measures. Have not yet received instructions to proceed to Alexandria.\n","71":"\n\nSlept in this morning. Did not wake till 7 AM. French Hydroplane flying about all the morning. Major Burgess and Lieut Gee came over from \"Geelong\". Wrote home to Nell, Alvord and Chris, also sent photo to Nell of leaving Brisbane, Church parades in Melbourne, and group of Officers on ship, taken at Port said. Convoy of 24 Indian Transports left Port Said today escorted by a French Man o’ War. They made a very effective show. Beautiful mirage effect about 9 AM this morning in the direction of Port Said. Sent mails off to \"Wiltshire\" at 2PM. Col Sutton visited his section on \"Medic\". \"Wiltshire\" signalled tonight that \"Southern\", \"Anglo Egyptian\" and herself were leaving for Alexandria. It looks as if we have done well with our horses and we are to remain till the last. We are all very anxious to get ashore. Our horses look very well, particularly \"Jack\" who is by far the best-looking horse on the ship.\n","72":"\n\nStill at Anchorage. Very disconcerting hanging about so long. Invite Major Parker and two subalterns from \"Medic\" to lunch. They brought the veterinary Officer with them and had a good look around the ship. During the afternoon a French hydroplane soared over us, took the water several times and made a very pretty show. Received word this evening to move off in time to reach Alexandria tomorrow at 2 PM. We are to leave at 11 tonight. Two serious cases of appendicitis. They are to be removed to Hospital for operation immediately on arrival. Had a game of bridge with the Captain, Col Sutton and Capt Dixon. This makes the third game I have had since leaving Brisbane. I shall be very glad to see our horses landed. They have had a desperately long journey and every day more tells on them.\n","73":"\n\nSailed at 11 last night for Alexandria reaching entrance to harbour at 12.30PM. Pilot came aboard and took us in to an Anchorage. Two acute appendicitis cases landed for operation. Adjutant and myself went ashore in Police Launch. Interviewed embarkation officers – arranged for berth no 60 for tomorrow.\n\nObtained a good deal of detailed information. Saw Major Gellibrand, received from him authority re coaling wages for men. Police launch took us back to ship. Mr Dowson, assistant Director of Coast Guards took us and stayed to dinner with us. He is a marine officer and very entertaining in conversation. He has been here 10 years.\n\nEighty one men again broke leave tonight and went ashore in bum boats. Toast to the King at Dinner, also captain and officers of Ship.\n","74":"\n\nMoved into berth at 1 o’clock. Raising of Horse brows and removal of Hospital patients prevented disembarkation commencing before 2.15PM. Arranged for Head quarters, 7th Battery and A.M.C. to proceed by first train. Loading of horses successfully carried out. Three men injured (not seriously) from kicks. Train moved off at 8.20 PM. Unloading of vehicles and stores continued to 9.30PM. Then gave general leave to remainder on board. Interview with Major Gellibrand, Commander Parker and Captain re payment to men for coaling. Arranged to refer to Captain who will minute the correspondence, then I shall forward claim to Head Quarters for settlement. During the afternoon a horse broke away, galloped a mile, then jumped into the harbour. He was rescued with difficulty, but appeared uninjured. Foal was left on board and given to the Chief Officer whose father has a farm in England. The Ship seems deadly quiet. The town is very interesting especially the native quarter. An enormous amount of shipping in port, including 22 German prizes. Good news tonight of the sinking of the \"Gneisenau\", \"Scharnhorst\" and \"Dresden\" by Admiral Sturdee’s squadron off the Falkland islands. Sick A.M.C. horse shot. Letters received from Nell dated Oct 16th, and Nov 1st.\n","75":"\n\nAll remaining units at work early excepting Infantry detail, who refuse duty and were placed in guard room. B.A.C. and D.A.C. units left by train at 5.40PM. horses went on\n\ntrain splendidly. Telephoned Cairo for an officer and 20 men to take over Infantry details. These arrived about 8.30PM. Handed over unit.\n\nUnloading of vehicles proceeded all through the night till 4 AM. All very tired.\n","76":"\n\nLeft Alexandria at 4 AM. Reaching Cairo at 10.15. Bitterly cold in train. Stood on platform of carriage from daylight till Cairo was reached. Most beautiful Delta country, irrigated and every inch cultivated. Barley, maize, cotton, sugarcane, and vegetables growing luxuriantly. At intervals we passed Arab villages and occasional grave yards. Houses very quaint, generally built of mud. Date Palms in abundance. Interesting wheels to raise water from canal levels to level of ground to be irrigated. Country full of Arab men, women and children journeying both ways along canal banks, some riding donkeys, mules, buffaloes and camels. I should love to ride through this Country on horseback at my leisure. In nearly all the villages we passed through, many minarets could be seen. On arrival at Cairo we at once detrained, unloaded vehicles and spent the day assembling parts for final removal of vehicles to camp.\n\nArranged for parties to come in from Mena to assist. Left Mr Ross in charge, and came to camp arriving at 11 PM. Met Mr Parker who directed me to 3rd Brigade lines. Very tired and slept soundly till 8 AM.\n\nBefore coming out I met Tasmanian and W. Australian Second trains and assisted to detrain their vehicles.\n","77":"\n\nBreakfasted \"Al Fresco\", as much sand as food. Pyramids looming up in front of the camp. The camp is pitched on very sandy country but quite close to Pyramids and Mena House. Today the chief Pyramid has been covered with soldiers, clambering all over it. I have spent the day in looking after Brigade generally. I reported to Colonel Hobbs this morning. Have arranged for Brigade Mess to be run by ourselves. Mr Clowes to be mess Secretary.\n\nHad a visit from Majors King and Rabett, Capt McLaughlin and Lieuts Olding and Thornthwaite. I hope to see my old Battery tomorrow.\n\nGeneral Bridges and Colonel White rode around the camp this afternoon. Getting my own tent settled. Have fine E.P. about 21’ x 14’. I shall use it also as my private office and will be very comfortable.\n\nReceived two letters from Nell yesterday and one from Alvord. Nell’s last letter acknowledged receipt of ?20 sent to her. An old letter from Mr Baron received also one from Mr Philp in England. He wants to join us as a gunner if he can get across here.\n\nCamp is full of small mule and donkey teams and wagons, doing all the transport work for the troops. Train lines are laid through the camp for supply of materials, etc, and various macadamised roads are also being made. The camp is a huge show. The Accommodation House at foot of Pyramids, known as Mena House has been turned into a Hospital, and all Australian nurses are stationed there. The large swimming pool is made available for troops, 100 swimming at a time. Hope to find time in a few days to visit both Mena House and the Pyramids. We never expected we should get into this part of the world. I understand we are to stay here till March, certainly till the cold weather is over at the front. Just killed a fine healthy specimen of a mosquito.\n","78":"\n\nVery cold night. Beautifully fresh morning. Strenuous work all day getting tents for Units, having some erected and getting in stores and vehicles. It will take a few days to settle down. Majors King and Rabett also Lt Olding called along to see me. I have not yet had time to look at the old battery. Infantry are moving out in the mornings now to the accompaniment of their Bands. Lecture tonight by Major Hughes on \"Artillery Tactics\".\n","79":"\n\nAgain very cold crisp night. Went into Cairo with Major Browne to see about 8th Battery vehicles and B.A.C. vehicles. Had lunch at Kan el Nil barracks. Afterwards visited three shops to arrange for enamelled mess kit, it having been decided that all officers shall join in a Brigade Mess. Shops close from 1PM to 3 PM, so we did not quite complete our task before returning to camp. Had an Arab guide with us, the son of the Sheik of Mena Village right against our camp. He explained many things to us, incidentally telling us of his approaching marriage, and the customs in connection therewith. These guides are evidently feeling the loss of trade in connection with tourists, there being no \"Season\" this year. We are trying to learn Arabic.\n","80":"\n\nSome tables and forms arrived for the Brigade. Erected the officers mess tents. Mess gear came out from town. All units settling down and vehicles coming along gradually. Horses being exercised daily. Trumpeters receiving instruction.

French and German classes commencing at Headquarters. Regret I know nothing of the languages and therefore it is useless to attend with those who already have a fair knowledge. Lecture tonight by Major Burgess on \"Employment of Artillery in War\" in conjunction with other arms. Good discussion.\n\nMajor Nicholson called in to listen. Rabett and Lloyd called this afternoon. I strolled into 1st Brigade lines. Saw Callaghan. Arabic class \n\ncommenced tonight after lecture. Hope to learn to speak fairly well while here.

Our C of E service conducted by Dean Talbot. Band from Infantry very \"sick\" indeed. This afternoon had large party of specialists out doing patrol work and doing helio work in addition. Very useful afternoon. Spent evening in writing home letters. Beautiful sight this morning from our church parade ground. The tents of various kinds, horses, vehicles, moving bodies of troops, sand hills, Pyramids, Palm trees and cultivation were all visible in one panorama. Hope to be able to secure a photograph showing everything. Colonel Hobbs wife and daughter have arrived at Cairo, also Major Parker’s wife. Mr Rogers wife who is a nurse at Mena House completes the party of W.A. wives. Mrs Christian is also at Cairo. I wish I could afford to bring my family here. No such luck. British protectorate established in Egypt. Special function in Cairo at which some of our Australian troops were present officially. \n","85":"\n\nSolid work throughout the Brigade. Teaching my class use of helio, also on model for reconnaissance. Out mounted in the afternoon. Lecture at night by Major Browne on Horse mustership and fitting of saddlery. We had a horse in the mess tent as a model. Arabic class afterwards. Posted letter to Nell, Alvord & Chris, also parents.\n","86":"\n\nOut signalling all the morning with Brigade class, and using Artillery abbreviations. In the afternoon I took a party\n\nof 50 mounted men for reconnaissance duties, past the Pyramids and round the Sphinx. Very interesting old ruins. I have not yet ascended the chief Pyramid (\"Cheops\")\n\nLecture to Brigade class tonight on \"Message Form\". Capt Marks returned from his trip to Luxor, and Lloyd of 1st Brigade called in re Head Quarters signalling class. Arranged to let my Brigade H.Q. Signallers attend.

Endorsed my previous recommendation re Jopp and Gee. Prepared plasticine model to illustrate lecture on \"Contours\". Mr Clowes explained \"Conventional Signs\". Practical map re4ading during afternoon. Col Hobbs came out and asked for recommendations for promotion of 2nd Lieutenant. I recommended all excepting Jenkinson.

Major Austin informed me Molasses etc from Alexandria was coming forward, and asked for fatigue party as \"consideration\". Out all day with Patrols. Passed through an interesting Arab village where we were very curiously observed. Further on we passed a Police station, belonging to Coast Guard Service in preventing smuggling.\n\nHere there were Soudanese officials with their wives, all as black as pitch. Came back at 4PM very tired. Practised helio work with moving stations. Discovered a man in the B.A. Column who is a professional artist, employed on the Bulletin Staff I understand. He is acting as a Patrol. I must secure him for Brigade head Quarters. Sent letter to Philp informing him I could give him a place as Corporal on head Quarters. I hope he can come here. Brigade signallers working under Capt Mackworth in helio station work. Signallers from 7 to 8PM, after that a free night.\n\nMajor Browne bought yesterday for me a dozen very good pictures of Cairo and surrounds.\n","89":"\n\nChristmas day – Very beautiful weather, but no \"Peace on earth\". Major Hughes, Capt Waite and Mr Jopp went out early, snipe shooting, only succeeding in bagging two brace.\n\nTurkeys, geese and lamb for Christmas dinner. Cooks made a specially good showing. Callaghan & Olding, also Capt Morton, N.Z.S.C. also present. Rabett and King could not get round.\n\nChurch service at 9.30AM\n\nAll units faring very well. Major Browne’s battery had an exceptionally good show, Turkeys, hams, beef, vegetables, fruits and sweets of all kinds. If they never obtain worse fare in their campaigning they will have no cause for complaint. Mr Phillip, tailor of Cairo, a friend of Mr Larcombe and Mr Short called on me.\n","90":"\n\nAt work during morning with Specialists class, then went into Cairo re British Warm and a cap. Called at Phillips shop, but finally decided to get what I required at Davies Bryan & Co. Returned to camp at 3 PM.\n\nMajor Rabett came over to dinner, and we had an interesting yarn about old times.\n","91":"\n\nMajor Hughes and party again went out shooting. They were the guests of an Englishman who is the manager of a large estate here. They came back with one duck and about a dozen waterfowl, the latter no good for eating. At 4 o’clock we left to visit an old gentleman in Cairo who is a most loyal subject and an influential Egyptian. Major Hughes & Martin, Capt McLennan and Lieut Jopp accompanied me. This man’s wife is a sister to the present Sultan’s wife, and he himself is the son of the late Governor General of the Soudan. Our chief interpreter here (Mr Bayley) has known him for many years and it was he who arranged the visit. On arrival we were shown into a fine hall, filled with most beautiful Oriental furniture and Turkish and Persian Carpets. He and his sons did all in their power to entertain us.\n\nThey gave each of us presents, drawing lots to ensure equal division. He gave me several interesting souvenirs and in addition has promised to frame my family photos in wood carved frames. My table\n\nwill then look quite Oriental. We sat down to a sumptuous dinner of about 15 courses, all exquisitely cooked. The table was set out in faultless British style, but the foods were prepared in Egyptian style. We left at 9PM and were escorted on foot through old Cairo.\n\nHe showed us many old historic buildings. The streets are very narrow. I am hoping to get one of my Head Quarters men who is good at water colour work to do me a few sketches. Altogether it was an exceedingly interesting evening.\n\nThe house is fairly pretentious, of three floors. The basement is used for the servants, the ground floor for guests, and the upper floor as the family’s private quarters. The women folk do not appear. All servants on first floor are Soudanese Eunuchs. I was placed in the post of honour at the head of the table while the father sat on my left. The sons waited at table, this being an especial way of honouring a guest. They afterwards dined by themselves. The father made a very interesting picture smoking his \"hubble bubble’. In fact I had a try but was not very successful. Reached camp at 11PM.\n","92":"\n\nHead Quarters at work on Telephone Construction. Several men are expert electricians so we should have no trouble in maintaining our phones in a high state of efficiency. With Capt Waite paraded Mr Jenkinson before Col Hobbs. I had to report against him. Col Hobbs asked him if he was prepared to resign, and he agreed. The matter is now going before General Bridges. He has proved totally unfitted for his job. A good deal of trouble with B.A.C. defaulters. They seem to have a bad lot among them. Have now to arm the guard. Lecture tonight by Major Hughes on \"Battery Tactics\". Plenty of discussion afterwards.\n","93":"\n\nBattery and Brigade Headquarters at work on Telephones. All units at battery drill. Went out with O.C to inspect routes to manoeuvre ground. Area proved to be very satisfactory, but roads leading thereto very bad indeed. Interview with Col Hobbs and Brigade Commanders re training areas. Jenkinson paraded before Colonel Hobbs. He agreed to resign. General lecture to all units at 2.30PM regarding conduct of troops in Cairo and behaviour generally. Members of 3rd Inf Bde not implicated.

Full attendance of officers. He referred to pamphlet issued by war Office giving details of war at the front, especially with regard to Artillery. Makes one feel the seriousness of the situation and if prevailing conditions hold on, how few of us will return to Australia. \n","95":"\n\nAt work on Telephones and signalling. Batteries laying. Sir George Reid addressed troops today. With him came Mr Mackenzie (High Commissioner for N.Z.) and Generals Maxwell & Birdwood. Sir George made a good speech and specially asked all ranks to uphold the good name of Australia. Invited to dance at Continental Hotel but did not accept. Plenty of noise at midnight and bands playing out the old year and ushering in the new.\n","96":"\n\nNew Year’s day – and plenty of hard work. Beautiful day. Batteries are at work on Gunlaying and battery drill. Lecture by Major Browne on the \"use of Aircraft in relation to Artillery\". I missed the lecture as Colonel Hobbs had asked me to dine with him at Headquarters Mess. Very nice dinner and interesting discussion on present military situation. Promotion of officers notified today, presumably as New Year gifts. Col Christian received promotion, also Capt Jopp, Callaghan and Kingsmill. Mr Jenkinson tendered his resignation.\n","97":"\n\nDigging gun pits and epaulments. Afternoon holiday. I went out on manoeuvre area with Major Hughes, Burgess, Browne and Capt Waite.

Took Benson out during the afternoon over the manoeuvre area and gave him instructions in Field sketching from a military point of view.\n","99":"\n\nThe whole Division moved out to manoeuvre area. Col Christian and Col Johnstone delayed us considerably. Very good ground to work over. Started on gun layers tests for 9th Battery. Very solid going for horses. Returned to camp at 3.45PM. \n\nDiscussion with Colonel Hobbs. I suggested we should leave all vehicles on the area permanently and only bring teams back. Guard to be left consisting of gun layers who will thus get more time for their very exacting work. water tank burst tonight and flooded portion of the camp. Luckily our camp is too high to be affected. Mr Jenkinson’s resignation accepted.\n","100":"\n\nLeft camp at 8.30 for manoeuvre area. Difficulty about water carts. Short measure for horses. Very useful day for all ranks. Layers being tested. General Birdwood looked round my Batteries about 1.30 PM. He had General Bridges with him.\n\nHe seems generally pleased with the Artillery. Mr Jenkinson took his departure from camp and joined up in Lt Col Stoddart’s Light Horse.\n","101":"\n\nLeft for training ground at 8.30, returning to camp at 1.45. again trouble with watercarts. Not sufficient in number. Terribly dusty road. Everybody covered when they returned to camp. Our tents also full. Adjutant out on Area at 7AM, testing layers.

Major Burgess arranged miniature range. Good work at battery manoeuvre. Many mistakes made, noted, and pointed out to all Officers at night. Laying tets continues. Not very satisfactory results. The 7th battery especially requires a great deal of practice.\n","104":"\n\nHorses resting. Batteries harness cleaning and shoeing horses. Damaged water cart of 3rd Inf Brigade being repaired. B.C?. and Subaltern Officers out on manoeuvre area with myself reconnoitring positions for occupation by batteries at night. Moved out at 7.30PM tonight to take up these positions.

Would have appreciated another hour. Major Burgess took church parade while I wrote letters to Nell, the boys, home, and Arthur King in Melbourne. I also sent Post Cards of Port Said to Chris and Alvord and 12 cards of Cairo environs to Nell. The latter were very good pictures indeed. During the afternoon Ali Bey and his son motored out and stayed to dinner with us. He seemed to enjoy himself thoroughly and was much interested in the Ammunition Column wallaby. He also brought me out three extra photo frames, for Alvords, Charleys and Chris’ photos. I have them all framed now. Ali Bey left at 8PM. I saw him past the guards and then returned to my tent.\n","106":"\n\nLeft camp at 8.45 for training ground.\n\nObtained 5 small tanks to supplement water carts for units.

Major Burgess is absent too in a court martial.\n\nLecture given tonight at Mena House by Col Sheen on \"International Law respecting war\". It was very interesting. I should not have attended as I felt very rocky, and I was very glad to get to bed.\n\nFriday 15th January\n\nNot feeling much better, but decided to go to training area. Returned at 2.30. received two letters from Nell dated Nov 16th and Nov 22nd, also Christmas card from charley.\n\nLayers of 7th Battery tested, 5 passed in test \"A\".

Did not appear too satisfactory; the 2nd Brigade shoot tomorrow, the","111":" Brigade on Friday.\n\nReceived letter from Nell dated","112":" also card from Chris. Nell appears to think I am having an excellent time in Egypt. Good living and plenty of social life, both of which ideas are quite untrue. She will perhaps believe the truth when she hears it from outsiders.\n","113":"\n\nStayed in camp today. Gave all units of Brigade an opportunity to make all adjustments, clean harness, guns, etc, prior to shooting on Friday. Shooting of 1st Brigade on Wednesday appeared to be very unsatisfactory. Shooting of","114":" Brigade today proved to be good. It is up to us to do well tomorrow.\n\nGeneral Birdwood today sent me an invitation to dine with him at Shepheards Hotel on Saturday night at 7.30. Hope I shall be able to get some information concerning our future movements. Put in strong report today regarding condition of horses. They are perceptibly getting poorer and weaker. Major Matson thinks they get too much work – Absurd – The ration is the trouble.\n","115":"\n\nLeft for training area at 8.30 with","116":" Battery. This battery shot first. Reconnaissance exceedingly well carried out. First round off very quickly. Fire discipline good. Second series by Capt Leslie not too good. Observation very faulty.

He has just returned from France and gave us a great deal of valuable information. Returned to camp about 1 AM. I saw an interesting sight in Cairo during the afternoon. A man bearing a cow, and carrying a calf. He stopped in front of a man, put down his calf, and \n\nmilked a small jug full of milk, which the man paid for, and drank. I then discovered the calf was stuffed. General Birdwood told me that when a calf dies the cow will not give down its milk, and in consequence they have to deceive her with a stuffed calf. Brought home sketching blocks.\n","119":"\n\nChurch parade at 9.30. Class with officers for sketching using new blocks, director and estimated ranges.\n\nHad a good sleep this afternoon. Interview with Colonel Hobbs at night, discussing personal matters concerning whole Artillery.\n","120":"\n\nAt work on manoeuvre area. Good work done. Col Christian \"jumped\" my portion of ground.

Major Hughes, Capt Waite and myself invited to dinner at Mr Pengelley’s house tonight. Had a very pleasant evening. Returned to camp at 11PM.\n","122":"\n\nStayed in camp today to rest horses. Very lucky we did. Terribly dusty day. With Col Hobbs inspected gun emplacements made during the previous night. Mapped out scheme for tomorrows work. Rumoured that a night turn out was to be expected, it did not eventuate however. FEast of the Prophet in Cairo.\n","123":"\n\nGood work on training area, engaging different targets from behind cover by Compass bearing and in the open.\n\nApproval received to discharge several men for misconduct.

Started Prior on Bivouac sketches, and prepared syllabus of work for ensuing week. Received Divisional Order calling for Route March on Monday morning at 9 AM, the 3rd F.A. Brigade leading. On Brigade parade I discharged men to return to Australia for misconduct. \n","126":"\n\nI dodged Church Parade this morning. Had to make sketches of Bivouacs and letters to write. Wrote Nell and the three boys. Had a sleep this afternoon. Tent very hot. Train Wagons left in our lines in preparation for tomorrow’s March.\n","127":"\n\nRoute March very successful. Left at 9AM, reached camp about 3.30PM. The 3rd F.A. Bde eulogised by Gen Birdwood and Bridges also Colonel White. Turn out very good. Lecture to O.C. Batteries in the evening and officers generally by Col Hobbs in the 1st Brigade lines.\n","128":"\n\nMoved out of camp early. Selected Bivouac at bottom of desert near Pengelley’s plantation. Constructed gunpits by all Batteries and \"dugout\" for myself prepared by my own Headquarters during daylight. Then again at night men did the same work over again finishing about midnight. At about 5PM a terrific sand storm arose, continuing till about 7PM, and a beautiful mess it made of us and our bivouac. Our cloth spread for the evening meal was about hidden from view under the drift sand. Our meal was not enjoyed at all.\n","129":"\n\nReturned to camp about 10.30. men spent day cleaning harness and guns. Colonel Hobbs came out at 8AM to inspect our gun pits. Preparing Sundry sketches and schemes during day. Bitterly cold night.\n","130":"\n\nAt work on manoeuvre area. Colonel Hobbs brought out R.F.A. Colonel, named Cunliffe Owen.

Benson of Head Quarters has been today getting some local studies for water colour sketches.\n\nGeneral instructions to sketchers of each Battery. No letters from Australia this week – shortage of boats evidently.\n","131":"\n\nOn manoeuvre area. The 2nd Brigade was to have commenced shooting, but as Colonel Owen (now Brig Gen Owen) could not come out and was particularly anxious to see the shooting, it was postponed till Monday. We bivouaced near Pengelley’s date plantation and had a much better night than Tuesday last. Dug in the whole battery with forward observing posts and my own shelter, all connected by Telephone. Very cold night. \n\nSaturday 6th February\n\nReturned from bivouac to camp at 9AM. Then the whole Artillery Division was formed up under \"self ridge\" close to camp and a photograph taken. The Artillery covered many acres and made a most imposing picture. Afterwards all Artillery officers rode to the Pyramids and, grouped upon the lower courses of stone of \"Cheops\" were again photographed. We hope to get some good pictures as a result.\n\nSunday 7th February\n\nVisited Cairo, Maadi Camp and Heliopolis. Maadi camp which is a few miles from Cairo along the Banks of the Nile is certainly a miserable spot, not nearly as nice as Mena, but alongside are numerous fine residences and the owners have been\n\nvery good to our Light Horse officers, practically giving them entrée to their homes at any time for use of hot baths. At Heliopolis I saw some magnificent residences, including one of the Sultan’s palaces.\n\nIncidentally, on the way to Heliopolis (where reinforcements are camped) I saw the Turkish prisoners from the Canal. When I got to camp at 5.30 PM I found Harry waiting to se me. He has come out with the Second Contingent. He told me of the trouble at Gordon. I gave him dinner. He left about 8PM.\n\nMonday 8th February\n\nThe 2nd Brigade shooting today. The 3rd Brigade remained in camp overhauling guns and equipment generally. General Cunliffe Owen gave us a lecture at night, which was full of interest and concerned the Retreat from Mons. He himself was present at the front for some months and spoke from actual experience. He is an entertaining lecturer, but gave us some particulars of actions which made me think seriously. We are looking forward to his future lectures.\n\nTuesday 9th February\n\nAll officers of 3rd Bde and many drivers as well as Headquarters watched shooting of 1st Brigade. Rabett and King’s batteries did exceedingly well – just what might have been expected from Howitzer officers – B.C? fired both series. Did not see 1st battery shoot. Went into Cairo at 5PM to get electrical fittings for signalling buyzers, returned to camp by 9 PM tram. Received big mail from Australia, parents dated","132":" Jan, Chris Jun","133":" Alvord","134":" and","135":" Jan, and Nell","136":" Made up for shortage of last week. Delighted to hear Alvord passed Educational and Medical exams for Australian Naval College. I feel sure he will pass the Interviewing Committee.

We start operations tomorrow, and will be staying in camp in consequence. \n","137":"\n\nUnits at work on Training Area. I stayed in camp arranging re vaccination and interviewing reinforcements for vacancies in our Brigade. Major Parker and Major Hughes also in Camp as Presidents of Boards.\n\nCapt Jopp visited Carriage works re repairs to saddles, and banked Canteen money. New canteen opened today. Seems very well stocked. I hope it will be a boon to our men. Arranging for ranging table in mess to ensure our officers become prompt and efficient when acting as Battery Commanders. Making changes in Head quarters staff re Corporal and Telephone mechanic which should be satisfactory. \n","138":"\n\nThis date seems familiar. Today I reach 40 years. I wonder where I shall be next 12th February and what my experiences will have been during the year. Very pleased to receive cable from Nell conveying birthday greetings and also informing me that Alvord had been accepted for the R.A.Navy. Brigade stayed in camp and doctor vaccinated everybody again, small pox having made its appearance among the troops. Selected by Colonel Hobbs with Major Browne and Major King to go tomorrow to Suez to study fortifications there and view the country over which the Turks attacked. Went into Cairo at 7.30, visited the \"Kurral\", then turned in at Continental Hotel. Fresh draft of horses taken over by Brigade.\n","139":"\n\nCaught train at Cairo Central Station at 7AM. About 20 officers comprised the party. Passed through Tel el Kebir on way to Ismailia, and also saw on our right the Ancient Land of Goschen. Went through Ismailia to Kantara, about 20 miles nearer Port Said at which place some fighting had taken place. We saw a great deal of earthworks, gun emplacements etc on the Western Bank of Canal, but had no chance to inspect them. At Kantara we found the station buildings protected with sand bags, and an armoured train drawn up alongside\n\nthe station. A major Brigham of the 69th Punjabis conducted us over the defensive works on the Eastern side of the Canal at Kantara. They were very extensive and complete. From the roof of the Observation House we obtained a fine view of the Surrounding Country.\n\nHe also showed us where the Turks attacked but we had not time to go out to the position. General Knox is in Command of this Section, and greatly strengthened his position by inundating the surrounding country from the canal, thus making a very effective barrier. This position had been strongly fortified as it is the Commencement of one of the main caravan routes through the Sinai Peninsula; the other routes coming in at Tussum below Ismailia, and at Suez. We left Kantara at 1.5, journeyed by train to Ismailia, then took ferry down the Canal to Tussum. Ismailia is an exceedingly pretty spot, and has some magnificent avenues of trees and glorious purple and orange Bouganvillae in abundance. On the wharf we saw 18 large zinc boats about 20’ x 5’ which the Turks had somehow hauled across the desert and used in their attempted crossing of the Canal. On arrival at Tussum we were shown the fortification at the post and then proceeded along the banks of the canal to Serapeum, some 3 miles, and it was along this front the main fighting took place. I should have mentioned that just before reaching Tussum we saw some Sikhs dragging two dead Turks from the canal. They had evidently been shot while attempting to cross. About 350 prisoners were taken at this point and about 100 killed and wounded. The Turks force was estimated at 13,000 with 14000 camels. Special orders were given that our troops should act on the defensive only and take no offensive action, otherwise the whole show with its guns could have been captured. \n\nPolitical or Mahommedan considerations governed the case. We saw the graves of many Turks, some with arms and legs protruding. They had taken up positions behind little sand mounds, and in each case here were to be seen numbers of empty cartridge cases. We saw some hundreds of boots tied in pairs which had evidently been discarded by the Turks in the expectation of having to swim the canal. We saw the grave of a German Officer, Major Von Hagen, marked with a cross. He deserved his fate for he showed a White Flag, and when our men ceased firing his rear lines still continued. His white flag appears to have been a regular part of his kit, for he had a little khaki case for it. This has been\n\nsent to Lord Kitchener by General Birdwood.\n\nAll the dead were very poorly clad and all indications point to the troops having had a bad time crossing the desert.\n\nWe returned to Ismailia about 7.30, caught train at 8.5, and reached Cairo at 11.15PM. Major King and myself then came out to camp. I met Colonel Semmens of Victoria with this party and incidentally informed him he had got me into trouble by writing letters home from Albany and Colombo. He told me he had personally dodged the Censors. Travelling in the Egyptian railway is very comfortable. Dining saloon very good and meals well served. Transfer of men to Brigade to fill vacancies given effect to. \n","140":"\n\nFeel very tired this morning and not much inclined for Church parade. However I attended. Afterwards I gave a little lecturette to the Brigade giving an account of my trip to the Canal. Working on schemes for Tuesday’s shooting. Wrote letters to Nell, Chris, Alvord, Admiralty and Stacy Waddy. Coloured plates for aeroplane signalling. Pow wow with B.C? at night.\n","141":"\n\nBrigade working in Camp, preparing for shooting. \n","142":"\n\nStayed in camp today preparing for night March, bivouac and tactical shooting. Moved out with B.C? at 2 PM to reconnoitre positions. Selected same also Bivouac. Brigade moved out of camp at 7.30PM reaching bivouac about 9. Major Burgess placed two of his guns for night firing. The D.A.C. failed to supply ammunition, consequently night series was not fixed till midnight. Aiming point was a lamp on top of \"Cheops\". Zones of front allotted to each battery. (all units spent the night preparing gunpits and observing stations.) Guns in position at 10 AM. Delay in supply of ammunition from DAC caused further delay. Shooting commenced about 11 AM. Excellent results. All batteries did good work. A distinguished Party watched the proceedings. General Sir A. Maxwell, General Birdwood, Generals Walker and Bridges and the Marquis of Anglesey. They all congratulated Colonel Hobbs on the work of the 3rd Brigade, and after the shoot\n\nhad a look at the Battery positions and emplacements. Returned to camp feeling very tired. Had good bath and sleep, Col Hobbs had a pow wow in the evening in our mess tent. All officers of all Brigades present. The Col was very congratulatory.\n","143":"\n\nBatteries in camp. D.A.C. gunners receiving instruction. Lieut McAdam posted to vacancy in B.A.C.\n\nConference at Mena House, Divisional Headquarters re scheme for 20th inst. Working in conjunction with signal units. Chiefly to test Communications. Major Burgess selected to go to Suez Canal to inspect defensive works. Col Johnstone and Christian also went. \n","144":"\n\nAt work in camp all day. Col Christian’s Brigade did its reconnaissance during the afternoon prior to moving out at night at 7.30PM. My staff, and all Battery Commanders accompanied me today in a reconnaissance of the Country over which the Head Quarters scheme is to be worked on 20th inst. Made sketches of the position and prepared reconnaissance report. Forwarded same to Divisional Head Quarters.\n","145":"\n\nCol Christian’s Brigade carried out shooting and did very well. Very pleased Rabett and King did well. Several of my officers witnessed shooting from the range, remainder from firing point where I gave particulars and explanation of work done to a number of Infantry officers who were \"sight seers\". The 1st Brigade had no night firing. Pow wow at night in 1st Brigade lines.\n","146":"\n\nOut all day on Tactical Scheme. Commenced at 7.30AM and finished up at 6 PM, which meant it was 7.30 before we washed and ready for dinner. Very good days work. Our Brigade Communications worked admirably. No hitches. Hughes, Waite and myself went to dinner at Pengellys, returned home 11.30PM. Very crisp and sharp riding home in the night air. Old Jack was out for a gallop and I had a great job to hold him in.\n","147":"\n\nDid not attend Church Parade. Slept in for a change and wrote letters and posted up Diary. Had a good sleep in the afternoon, quite an unusual occurrence for me.\n","148":"\n\nEmma’s Birthday today. Batteries all at work in camp. Col Johnstone’s Brigade carried out its reconnaissance preparatory to tomorrow’s shoot. I was with Colonel MacLagan all day during the fighting of a delaying action. General Birdwood was present. The Infantry did very good work. \n","149":"\n\nCol Johnstone’s Brigade carried out its final shoot. I was ordered to explain scheme and operations to a number of Infantry Colonels who had come out to witness shooting. Shooting of Brigade at commencement very poor. Battery Commanders did not understand ranging from use of map only. later in the morning work was better. Lecture at night and criticisms. Colonel Hobbs practically gave us a \"good bye\" address. He anticipated our Division will be soon broken up and moved off. Instructions received to prepare 8th Battery for departure 27th inst.\n\nNecessary orders given. Commenced French class.\n","150":"\n\nObtained leave to visit New Zealand Field Artillery at Zeitoun. Saw 4\".5 Howitzers and went through their mechanism. Had an interesting time with Col Johnstone who drove me into Cairo in the afternoon in one of the N.Z. staff cars. Very hot day, camp very dusty and trying. Purchased pumps for use of Brigade, 5 per battery and 1 for Brigade Head Quarters, for use in pumping out trenches and assisting in watering horses.\n\nReturned to camp at 5PM. Received letter from Nell dated Jan 24th, Emma, Alvord and Chris ditto.\n","151":"\n\nBattery Commanders in charge of their Batteries in camp. Officers of 1st Brigade who have not previously had series did some shooting. Adjutant and myself reconnoitred country for purposes of signalling scheme laid down for 26th inst. Instruction on European maps with O.C? Received two letters from Charley and one from A.T.Sharp.\n","152":"\n\nHad photograph taken of Brigade Officers in the morning. Could not get guns out for photo of whole Brigade owing to painting operations. At 1 o’clock Brigade and Battery staffs also OC, BAC and details moved out to take part in signal exercise, which continued until 12 midnight.\n\nWe arrived back in camp about 1 AM, and our mess secretary had been good enough to arrange for Hot Supper for us all, and it was duly appreciated. Charley writes me that the \"Australia\" and \"Sydney\" are now with the Home fleets.\n\nReceived instructions to prepare No 3 Section B.A.C. for immediate departure to – no one knows where - The 3rd Infantry Brigade together with engineers, ASC, AMC etc and our battery and portion of Column are under orders to leave tomorrow. We do not know if they are simply going forward to a base, or whether they have a definite job on hand. Their ships are under sealed orders till they are 20 miles out at sea from Alexandria. I wish my whole Brigade had received orders to March.\n\nNew extension shields are now fitted to 8th Battery guns, and will in due course be fitted to all guns of our Division.\n","153":"\n\nUnits stayed in all day after labour of previous evening. The 3rd Infantry Brigade are very busy getting ready to move, also our No 3 Section of B.A.Column. All left camp about 6 PM. Capt Waite went in with his section and saw them safely entrained. Mr McAdam had previously gone to Alexandria with an Advanced Party for him. \n","154":"\n\nChurch Parade at 9.30. Presbyterian padre. Band of","155":" Infantry played for us. I was wrong in stating above that Units moved out on Saturday. They left this evening at 6PM. At 5.30 I inspected our men and gave them a few words of advice and farewell. Wrote to Nell, Alvord, Charley, Chris, Emma and Father. \n","156":"\n\nBatteries of 2nd Brigade did shooting. Passable in parts, good in others. Our officers and men attended and watched the shooting. Conference during afternoon re Friday’s signal scheme. Major Parker, Capt Mclennan and myself attended Pathe Freres Picture show in camp. Quite a night of dissipation. \n","157":"\n\nThe 2nd Brigade finished shooting, 3rd Brigade followed on. I succeeded in getting Colonel to allow all my remaining subalterns to shoot, so now all my officers have conducted shell practise. General Bridges was present. Moving targets generally used. One series against new B.C? protecting shield provided by Colonel. Though fire seemed very effective only one bullet hit the shield. Pow wow at conclusion of shoot. General Owen gave lecture at night on ‘The Battle of the Aisne\". Very interesting. \n","158":"\n\nWent into Cairo in the morning re repairs to gum boots and switch fittings. Pumps completed for batteries and B.A.C. Units cleaning guns and harness. Discussed Divisional Scheme for Friday with Battery Commanders.\n","159":"\n\nWent out with Colonel and Staff to make Artillery reconnaissance of Country west of camp for Divisional exercise. I provided an officers patrol in addition. Rode my new horse, he is quite good. In the afternoon I made a reconnaissance with battery Commanders. Decided on positions for guns etc.\n","160":"\n\nUnits getting remainder of equipment from Ordnance. All gun shields now supplied and being fitted. At 1.30 Brigade moved out for signal exercise. Stayed out till 7.30 PM. Fired some silly blank ammunition. Returned to camp at 9 o’clock.\n","161":"\n\nUnits still on remnants of equipment. Col White informed me we would all be away in six days. Hope it is true.\n\nInspected units this morning. So did doctor. Clean bill of health.\n\nOur men are either improving in morals or becoming more careful.\n\nThis afternoon I climbed \"Cheops\". About 460 feet to top and a very solid climb. Also inspected interior. It is very uncanny. This is my first visit. Hope to get to Sakkara sights tomorrow also Memphis. It means about a 20 mile ride, but unless I go tomorrow I shall probably not have another opportunity. No mails from Australia this week. \n","162":"\n\nCapt Waite and Lieut Ellis left camp with me at 7.15AM to visit Sakkara and Memphis, about 3 ½ hours from Camp.\n\nAt Sakkara we inspected four tombs. Tomb of Ti, Serapeum or Tomb of the Sacred Bulls, Ptahkotep, and Mera (Mena?). We found them intensely interesting, the carvings on the walls and the effective colouring being particularly good. The book \"The Tombs of Sakkara\" by A.A. Quibell gives all details so I will not enter them here. After inspecting these tombs we rode on to the ruins of the Ancient City of Memphis. Very little remains to be seen here, but we saw the two Statues of the Rameses (the great and the 2nd) also a good specimen of Sphinx, and the granite ruins of an Ancient Temple, which must have been very fine in its day. We returned to Camp at 6.PM. An officer of Infantry this evening informed me my old 5\" Howitzers were on the way from Australia. Just as I write a man passing my tent said something about a sycamore tree, reminding me that today we saw several fine specimens, doubtless the same species as was climbed by our old friend Zaccheus of Bible history.\n\nTwo of our officers were today detailed for Landing and Embarkation duties at Alexandria. Expect we shall soon get a move on now.\n","163":"\n\nFilthy dusty day, with high wind. One of the worst we have experienced. Such days as this make us wish heartily that we could get away. Posted letters to Nell. Painting of vehicles of Brigade hung up because of dust and sand.\n\nWrote Gieve Matthews and Seagrave asking them to forward me regular copies of Monthly Naval List, also Army and Navy pattern Webley Scott pistol with case, lanyard etc.\n","164":"\n\nReceived letter from Nell dated Jan 26th, Chris dated Jan 28th and Arthur King dated","165":"\n\nWent into Cairo at 10 AM this morning and returned for lunch. Busy completing Brigade equipment from Ordnance.\n\nCol Hobbs informed me our Artillery Division would probably route March to Alexandria. I strongly supported the scheme.\n\nWe are now to wear coloured badges on each arm to distinguish our units. Our Brigade has Artillery Colours, dark blue and scarlet, with a bar of yellow in the centre. Terribly hot and\n\ntrying day. Practically impossible to do any outside work.\n\nMy batman has had a big day washing my soiled linen etc, and I now have a fine prospect ahead of me to darn all my socks prior to leaving Egypt. Still no definite date laid down for departure. Major Burgess slightly improving. Criticised work of officers Patrols. The 3rd Brigade L.Horse has come into the Camp.\n","166":"\n\nAgain an exceedingly hot day and filthy in the extreme. This is the 4th day continuously that we have had this weather.\n\nTents, food etc covered with dust and dirt. Very little work done.\n","167":"\n\nAgain filthy dirty and dusty day. Received invitation to dinner with the High Commissioner Sir H. McMahon.\n\nCompleted to day all equipment excepting cutting and shotting of tyres to some of BAC. G.S. Wagons. Had a long interview with Major Nicholson re Brigade Work in general. Standing orders of Army Corps (Australia & New Zealand) issued to O.C- units. Interview with major Brown re dismissal of charge \"neglect of duty\" laid against one of his sergeants by Mr Forrest, pointed out the seriousness of his action.\n","168":"\n\nObtained leave for the day. Left camp at 9. With Ali Bey and his son I visited the Arab Museum also the Egyptian British Museum. Both are exceedingly interesting especially the former. Would like to spend a couple of days in the latter. Had lunch at Continental Hotel. After lunch we went to the Tombs of the Mamelukes. There is certainly some wonderful work to be seen. I also wanted to see the interior of some of the Mosques, but we were pressed for time.\n\nWent to dinner at the British Residency at 8.15. All Australian Brigade Commanders present excepting Col Christian who for some reason was not invited. Very interesting evening. Returned to Continental Hotel at 10.30 for my coat etc. saw some naval officers and Midshipmen in the hall. I spoke to them and ascertained they had been with Charley at Dartmouth. They are serving on the \"Doris\". She is at present at Port Said and they had 48 hours leave. They have been shelling bridges etc in the vicinity of Alexandretta, and indications point to our going in that direction.\n\nMajor King and Hughes, Lieut Olding and Garling came home \n\nwith me in a car. Lieut Asher seriously ill with Pnuemonia and Measles. No hope held out for his recovery.\n\nOfficers patrols out at work\n","169":"\n\nAt last a beautiful day. Spent the morning with Officers Patrols, criticising their work of yesterday. After lunch I walked to Mena Hospital to see Lt Asher. Met Colonel (Dr) Springthorpe of Melbourne. He is attending him. Very seriously ill. He however recognised me and spoke a few words but it was apparent he had great difficulty and was in evident pain.\n","170":"\n\nBrigade drill during day. First chance we have had. Major Parker took ill this morning, also Lieut Vowles. Both in same tent.\n","171":"\n\nBrigade climbing hills, manhandling guns up and down hills. In afternoon swimming horses. Major Parker and Lieut Vowles admitted to Hospital at 2PM. At 4 PM Major Parker sank into unconsciousness, and at 10PM we were sent for as he was seriously ill. Col Springthorpe of Melbourne is attending him, but so far he has not been able to diagnose the case. Received letter from Nell dated Feby 15th also Chris and Alvord.\n","172":" \n\nPoor old Parker remained unconscious all day and died at 10PM. Doctors diagnosed the case as Cerebro Spinal Meningitis. A very sad ending. He had not opportunity to send a word of farewell to his wife or to his brothers who are here. Vowles improving. Asher is also improving. If he recovers it will be a wonderful case. He has been unconscious for some days.\n\nThursday 18th March\n\nThis morning the Brigade (less 8th Battery) crossed over Pontoon bridge, Major Browne and myself completed arrangements for Major Parker’s funeral. The Adjutant selected firing party of 200 rank and file and during the morning instructed them.\n\nFuneral moved off from Mena House Hospital at 2.30PM; the 8th Battery providing gun carriage and team. Major Brown, Burgess, Hughes,\n\nNicholson, Mills and myself acted as Pall Bearers. The grave is in the Old Cairo Military Cemetery among soldiers, many from our Division.\n\nMajor Parker’s death has cast quite a gloom over our Brigade. His is the first loss we have so far suffered out of over 700 officers and men.\n\nLecture tonight by Col Hobbs regarding Tactical schemes. He paid a tribute to the late Major Parker.\n","173":"\n\nOut all day on Tactical scheme. Returned to camp late in the afternoon. Very beautiful day. Most of our large tents withdrawn and only service bell tents now issued. We have again been warned to be ready to move at a moments notice.\n","174":"\n\nReadjusting our camp in consequence of alterations of pattern and number of tents. Otherwise an easy day. I had a good afternoon sleep.\n\nSunday 21st March\n\nChurch parade at 8.30 AM in Light Horse lines. Most officers out for the day. At 6 o’clock I went to the Pengelleys home and stayed to tea.\n\nMonday 22nd March\n\nDuring morning swam horses of 8th and 9th Batteries over canal on endless ropes. In afternoon built barrel pontoon and floated over guns and lumber. Colonel Hobbs present both morning and afternoon. At night all 3rd Brigade officers attended at Mess tent, and I read them extracts from the latest official notes from the front.\n\nTuesday 23rd March\n\nHorses of 7th Battery and B.A.C. practised in Swimming Canal. All horses of the Brigade have now had the experience. Battery gun drill in 8th and","175":" Batteries. Two new reinforcement officers posted to this Brigade today. (Capt Webb and Lt Thompson) also a number of men. New telephone equipment arrived, phones, switchboard, cells and other Telephone stores. Telephone Brigade cart still to come. Practised Jack and Dick on jumps today. Jack of course excellent and Dick shapes nearly as well. He is turning out an excellent charger. Received letter from Nell dated","176":" and one from Alvord from Jervis Bay enclosed.\n","177":"\n\nHoliday for Brigade. Went into Cairo and arranged to get photos of General Birdwood and Staff (our Army Corps) also small groups of Artillery Divisions and","178":" Brigade officers. Had my razor blades adjusted.\n","179":"\n\nBrigade scheme all day. Practising Communications.\n\nMajor Lynch sent a car for me from Maadi so that I could assist them at their concert at night. Mrs and two Miss Pengelleys from Mena (whose uncle resides at Maadi and who has done a great deal for officers and men there) also went. I had dinner with officers of 2nd L. Horse Brigade. Col Chauvel was also present. Returned home at 10.30 PM. Ali Bey made me a present of a lady’s evening wrap in net and silver for Nell.\n","180":"\n\nDivisional scheme for all Brigades. Lecture at 4.30PM. Spent the evening in getting my heavy baggage packed and ready for storage. Telephone cart arrived from England and handed over to Brigade. It is an improved pattern.\n","181":"\n\nLecture by Gen Cunliffe Owen at 9.30AM. Very interesting accounts of early part of war. Cooperation between Artillery and Infantry forcibly illustrated. Worked on Telephone detachment and instructed them.\n","182":"\n\nChurch Parade at 9AM. General Birdwood present also Staffs and Colonel Hobbs. Marched past after Service.\n\nThe worst day we have had in Egypt. Dust and sand in abundance. Stayed in the mess tent which was the only reasonably clean place.\n","183":"\n\nOur troops at Mena reviewed in morning by General Sir Ian Hamilton. General Godley also present. He invited us over to Zeitoun in the afternoon to see a review of the New Zealand & Austn Division. Major Burgess, Browne and Hughes accompanied Jopp and myself.\n\nWe had lunch at the Continental and then motored out to the review. It was a great sight though the dust rather spoiled the effect.\n","184":"\n\nBrigade Scheme. Practising Communications using new Telephone cart. Very hot and trying day.\n","185":"\n\nParades in hands of Battery Commanders. I went into Cairo during the morning re horses and spent the afternoon with Col Hobbs. Benson prepared a most excellent panoramic sketch of country for tomorrow’s operations\n","186":"\n\nDivisional scheme. Plenty of Generals about.\n\nBenson’s sketch much appreciated. Returned to camp at 3.15\n\nOne of my Head Quarters Signallers had a fall from his horse and fractured his collar bone.\n\nCol Hobbs and a big party off to Luxor tonight. I wish I could go, but had better save my cash.\n","187":" \n\nAt 11 last night I was sent for by Colonel Hobbs, and found we were at last under orders to embark for – somewhere.\n\nAll Brigade Commanders (or Staff) discussed details. This morning details were published of number of transports, O.Cs and troops. I have No 11 Transport (the \"Cardiganshire\") Lieut Clowes posted to 8th Battery. Lieut Richards from D.A.C. appointed as my Orderly Officer. I am quite satisfied with his appointment. He is a capable Officer. Arranging details re embarkation.\n","188":" \n\nBusy all day making arrangements for embarkation.\n","189":"\n\nAgain busy with embarkation returns etc. Plenty to arrange.\n","190":"\n\nAll arrangements complete for departure. I am due to leave Cairo station late tonight. I take over the \"Cardiganshire\" tomorrow as O.C. Troops. Major King’s coming with me. Tents all struck and returned by noon. Posted last letters to Nell, the three boys, Mother, John Halford, Emma and A.T. Sharp re electric torches.\n\nA most dreadful day at Mena, quite the worst we have had. Last night was particularly bad, and I was awakened about 2 AM by my tent collapsing on top of me. The guys had broken.\n\nEgypt must surely be sending us of \"full of grit\".\n\nLeft Cairo at midnight. Said goodbye to Mrs Rabett, King and Sweetland.\n\nReceived letters from Nell dated Feby 28th and March 5th.\n","191":"\n\nArrived at Alexandria at 5.30AM, with first train. Major Hughes came next with his Battery about 2 hours later, then Capt Waite with his column. Boat was late drawing alongside so work of embarkation was not finished by nightfall. We are to continue again at 6AM tomorrow. Went into the town during the afternoon and forwarded £60 to John Halford to cover Charley’s a\/c to June 30th. Alexandria full of French and British troops. The former look to us very strange in their red breeches and blue coats, and also in the new grey uniform. Their rifles are much longer than ours, also the bayonets. Alexandria is full also of transports. About 70 in all. We are beginning to feel a warlike atmosphere surrounding us and getting into our bones. Very interesting buildings in Alexandria. One has to drive largely through native quarter before reaching the town proper. Street buildings are very quaint, mostly wooden framing with brick and stone filling, upper storeys generally cantilevered over lower ones. There are some fine buildings in the town proper.\n","192":"\n\nLoading resumed and completed. Went into Alexandria and posted keys of boxes to Nell, also letter to her.\n\nGot a pair of warm slippers at Davies Bryan also some socks.\n\nCapt Waite lost a horse from Colic. Major King also lost one in Cairo before entraining, through a similar cause. I shall try to replace them from remounts here. No leave allowed officers or men.\n\nThursday 8th April\n\nGot balance of 18pr Ammunition aboard (24242 rounds for BAC.) The 3rd Battery completed fuzing of shells for complete battery, and the 7th Battery commenced theirs.\n\nObtained two horses to replace the dead. Ordered off suddenly leaving Capt Marks and Lt Urquhart on shore. Actually moved off\n\nfrom Quay at 3.45 PM. As soon as we were outside I opened confidential packet which proved to be Handbook of the Turkish Army. Maps proved to be of Gallipoli. We had previously imagined we were to disembark on this peninsula and it now looks as if our ideas were correct. Several ships moved out before us, and the orders for all ships are to rendezvous at Mudros Bay on South Side of Lemnos Island. A second horse belonging to BAC, died this morning.\n\nFriday 9th April\n\nA beautiful morning – very smooths ea and everybody in general very happy. Quite a delightful change from sandy and dirty Mena. The 7th Battery completed fuzing of Shell. B.A.C. now busy on their Shell. Two guns of 7th Battery taken down during the day and thoroughly cleaned. Plenty of Mena sand removed. Others will be done tomorrow. S.A.A distributed to Units. Pistol Ammunition to Officers. Inspection with Capt at 10.30 AM. Boat generally very comfortable. Passages between horse stalls very narrow thus rather hindering work of men. About sundown we passed between Rhodes and Karpathos Islands. Captain has instructions to keep clear of Asia Minor Coast. We expect to reach Mudros Bay about 4PM tomorrow and sincerely hope we shall not have long to remain their before moving off to our destination. The horses will be our first consideration.\n\nShips Surgeon is attending to all sick, fortunately very few and minor cases.\n\nSaturday 10th April\n\nAnother very beautiful day. Temperature quite mild. We were told to expect cold weather. When I got up this morning we were abrEast the island of Skyros. At 1 o’clock boat stations were sounded and checking of rolls proved everybody in their place\n\nInspected ship at 10.30 AM with Captain. Very satisfactory. Arrived off Mudros Bay at 4.30PM, entered at 5 PM with troops dressing ship.\n\nTorpedo boats were guarding entrance to Bay. A boom is stretched right across the entrance, excepting a narrow way in for ships in the middle of boom. Many man o wars and Transports inside. As we anchored for the night just inside the boom we were unable to distinguish ships, excepting perhaps the 5 funnelled Russian Man O War \"Askold\".\n\nWe expect to move in early tomorrow morning, and I presume other Transports will also be coming from Alexandria. We are all sincerely hoping we shall not stay long here, but get off to our field of operations wherever it May be. B.A.C. completed storing of 18pr shells in wagons and Gd. Wagons. Small arm ammunition also issued to all ranks.\n\nSunday 11th April\n\nI hardly realise it is Sunday. One loses count of the days. Two Transports came in past us early this morning and we then moved in. We passed several Man O’ War, the leading one being the \"Queen Elizabeth\", and anchored inside the bay among a large number of Transports, more coming in during the day. Country around looks very pretty. Fairly high hills, nicely grassed but very few trees, and these only about the size of fruit terees. The town of Mudros itself is hidden from our view as we lie at anchor.\n\nAmong the warships in the Harbour are the \"Queen Elizabeth\", \"Cornwallis\", Lord Nelson\", ‘Queen\", beside other British ships the names of which we could not discern. One cruiser undergoing repairs seemed to have had a gruelling. A number of French ships, whose names I could not ascertain, were also at anchor, together with the Russian cruiser \"Askold\" which we first saw in Colombo and again at Port said. Besides these there are torpedo boats, Destroyers (I think the \"River class) submarines and Repair ships as well as parent Hydroplane Ship, the \"Royal Ark\". This afternoon a big Hydroplane has been circling around and above us. The sight here is very similar to what we saw at Albany, with the added interest of the Men O Fight and Hydroplanes etc. We sent off a big mail today, probably our last for some time. It is no joke censoring a ships mail of 500 odd men, and I shall want to curtail correspondence somewhat. Balance of our Eastern mail was delivered to us this afternoon. Nothing for me. At 4 O’clock a staff officer came off from Gen Hamilton’s flagship the \"Arcadian\" and invited me to go for a trip tomorrow on the \"Queen Elizabeth\" to the proposed place of landing at Gallipoli peninsula. All Brigade Commanders and higher are invited. A launch is to pick us up early in the morning and the \"Queen Elizabeth\" goes out at 8.30, returning about the same hour at night. As the journey is about 50 miles we anticipate we shall have about four hours there. The opportunity to examine this latest engine of war I much appreciate.\n\nMonday 12th April\n\nToday is probably the commencement of most unique and interesting experience for me. About 7AM a pinnace from the \"Queen Elizabeth\" took us off with other officers, and about 8.30 she moved away from her mooring. Gen Sir Ian Hamilton was aboard together with three other Generals of his Staff whom as yet I do not know, our three Infantry Brigadiers with their staffs and sundry other O.C.s. I was the only Artillery\n\nofficer present, Col Hobbs, Christian and Johnstone not having yet arrived in Port. The first impression my mind and vision received of this monster Battleship was one of awe. A description of her as far as I am able I will note later.\n\nJust after leaving \"prayers\" were said in which we all joined, and it appears a nice feature of naval life that the sailor who does not know whether today shall be his last or not, has at all events opportunity given him to place himself under the care of the Almighty. After service all the men ran round and round the deck at a smart double to the accompaniment of bright lively tunes from the Ships band. This continued for 5 minutes, and on a blast from a bugle the whole crowd halted and instantly commenced doubling in the opposite direction as if to unwind their previous movement. At the end of the second 5 minutes the same procedure took place again, giving in all 15 minutes smart doubling, the middies accompanying the men. There followed a few minutes physical exercise prior to dismissal to their various duties.\n\nThey look a fine hefty lot of men.\n\nWe had not proceeded very far before speed was increased and soon we were dashing through the water at 25 knots. The ship was like a rock, no movement, but the wash astern was tremendous. One sea came on the after deck and gave some of our officers as well as naval officers a wetting.\n\nWe have passed two French submarines the \"Le Voisier\" and \"Coulumb\", both very queer looking craft. In passing I May mention I was today told that our A.E.2 is due here from Malta in a day or two and is to do duty here. As we neared the Dardanelles we saw three rather fine looking battleships, and when passing about 500 yd from them I enquired their names. I was informed they were merchant service ships, rigged as dummies; funnels, guns, wireless gear, fighting tops etc. They are evidently serving a very useful purpose in \"bluffing\" the Turks.\n\nWhen we came off the entrance to the Dardanelles course was set up the West Coast of the Gallipoli peninsula at a distance of probably six or seven thousand yards from the shore. Just about this time a Destroyer of the \"Beagle\" class (a later class from Australian \"River\" type) joined us and convoyed us round till the time for leaving in the afternoon.\n\nAs we were coming up to the entrance we could see on our left at some distance the fleet of Men O’ War standing by, and actually at the entrance three Men O’ War and a Destroyer. Two of the Men O’ War were \"proping off\" in the direction of Troy, searching for Field Howitzers and incidentally practising communication by wireless from Aircraft working in conjunction with them and \"spotting\" their shooting for them. We could see the flashes of discharge at the ships side, and bursts of shell on main land. \n\nThe third Man O’ War was the \"Swiftsure\" and the Admiral of the \"Queen Elizabeth\" (Vice Admiral de Roebeck) told me she would be shooting later in the day. We followed up the Coast as far as \"Suvla Bay\" and \"Cape Suvla\", then turned and came back, but this time much nearer the coast, being I estimated between three and four thousand yards off shore. We were asked not to show ourselves but to remain under cover, which we did. On the run back along this coast the engines were reversed (to test some work recently completed) and for a little time we travelled stern first. At this juncture 4 shots were fired at us presumably from 6\" guns ashore. The shells hit the water with a big splash some hundreds of yards in front of us. I made rough sketches of the Country in outline as seen from the ship, and there appeared to me to be quite a number of suitable landing places, but \"Suvla Bay\" appears to be the best spot, and from my observations of today I hope the Artillery will be directed to this Bay. The Country looks very well. Green sward intermingled with scrub, and altogether it looks quite good country to work in. The High land in vicinity of Trig Station 706 at narrowest part of Peninsula is apparently strongly held, any number of trenches being visible. They May be dummies, but at all events they are sited on a very commanding height.\n\nWe crossed the entrance to Dardanelles from North to South, then steamed for some distance along the coast on the Asia Minor side. Here again I made some more outline sketches. The large village of \"Yeni Shehr\" had been heavily bombarded and certainly showed the result in the ruined condition of its buildings.\n\nPassing further south we saw a big group of Man o’ War. (I should say about 50 of all classes and nationalities) at anchor under the lee of Tenedos island. Then we headed for home and reached the moorings in Mudros Bay at 6PM.\n\nThe officers on the ship were particularly kind to us, and went to no end of trouble to explain everything possible. We all had an opportunity of examining the mechanism of the wonderful 15\" guns and saw them loaded. The whole process only takes about a minute. We saw the record of rounds fired by one forward 15\". The Gun Layer had marked in pencil on the inside of the Turrett \"Angry Rounds\" \n\nMarch 3rd ???????? 11 Kilidbakr\n\nMarch 18th ???????? 32 Chanak\n\nI do not know how many rounds the others fired. Shrapnel for 15\" is carried on board. One can hardly imagine the scatter of bullets from one round if nicely burst in air. The eight 15\" guns constitute\n\nthe main armament, and in addition there are a number of 6\" and Anti Submarine and Aircraft guns. Eight torpedoes are carried aft with two tubes, and I understand the same forward.\n\nShip is driven by turbines, with oil fuel. Engine and boiler rooms spotlessly clean. The \"Queen Elizabeth\" has in all been hit 15 times, chiefly with Field Howitzers, doing practically no damage except to wooden decking. One shell about 2\/3 the size of our 18pr entered the side of Ward room, then burst, the bullets scoring the top of the heavy Cedar tables and spattered in inside partition, the case going through. In making its entry the shell cut a piece out of the ship’s side, about 10\" long and about 6\" wide. These trophies have been mounted. The shell on a board, the fragments of ships side as a gong, and the gunmetal fuze from the shell fitted to an ebony handle and used as a striker for the gong. Luckily no one was present in the Ward room when the visitor called. Altogether the day was most interesting and instructive.\n\nWhen I finished dinner I reported to Col Hobbs (who had arrived in Port during the day) and was informed I am to go up again tomorrow in the \"Queen\", also a fine Man o’ War, and I am given to understand that I shall in all probability have the honour of directing the first Field Artillery to commence Land operations.\n\nOn Colonel Hobbs ship I met a brother of Major Macksworth. He also is a major and belongs to the Flying Corps. He is to assist the navy by \"Spotting\".\n\nTuesday 13th April\n\nLanding parties working all day practising. At 2.30 PM I reported to the \"Minnewarka\", thence proceeded by launch to H.M.S. \"Queen\". Here were assembled the senior officers of the previous day’s excursion, with some others and Generals Birdwood and Bridges. The idea is to get in close to Gallipoli Peninsula and thoroughly examine the Coast line with a view to possible landing places.\n\nThe Admiral (Admiral Thursby) gave us during the afternoon an account of the navy operations up to date and outlined the proposed Combined action of Navy and Army. General Birdwood also spoke to us and informed us that the 29th Division, a French Division and the Royal naval Division were to cooperate with us. Details are confidential, but I think my memory will not fail me when the time comes to recount our movements. The undertaking is a colossal one, and is unique in the World’s History. We had all brought our blankets etc and made beds for ourselves in various odd places.\n\nAt daylight we were w ell into the Gulf of Saros, and steamed slowly down close to the shore, past Cape Suvla and down to Cape Helles. My previous opinion of the Coast and Country is confirmed, and I think the job we are called upon to tackle can be carried out successfully by our Australian troops.\n\nAfter crossing the Entrance to the Dardanelles we steamed over to Tenedos. Here Major Villiers Stewart was landed. We saw the combined fleet at anchor, the little village with its tile roofs and the Venetian castle in the foreground. We steamed round the island, testing a special trailer shell for use against aircraft as we went along.\n\nReturned to anchorage at Mudros at 4 PM. Altogether an exceedingly interesting trip.\n\nDetailed Mr Vowles from the Brigade to report to Head quarters at 9 AM today for duty as forward observing officer for Navy shooting.\n\nLanding from Transports being practised all day.\n\nI hope to secure charts of all this part of the world, so that on my return, I shall be in a better position to describe to others my movements.\n\nThursday 15th April\n\nBoat crews operating all day. I went out with a party at 9.30 for Mudros Village. Passed a \"tow\" consisting of horses and guns from 8th Battery who were landing. They are I understand to be first ashore when business begins. Mudros Village is a very quaint place, and apparently very old. I walked through the village, thence along a road for 3 miles round the shore where our Artillery and Infantry were practising landings, from which spot my boat picked me up.\n\nThe country is fairly extensively cultivated, wheat and oat crops about 12\" high and look extremely pretty, for millions of scarlet Shirley poppies and a small variety of blue pea are scattered all over the fields.\n\nOn the hillsides numerous mills are to be seen. Built of rubble masonry about 20’ in diameter and about 25 feet high, they are fitted with a huge frame, carrying sails, which are set whenever the wind blows or there is grain to grind. These frames activate a crank shaft which in turn operates mill stones. They look very quaint indeed.\n\nI passed several small flocks of sheep, each with its shepherdess and the proverbial crooked stick. Sheep appear almost like small Angora goats with their long silly coats, and every second sheep carries a bell, so that in approaching a flock of sheep one hears a strange musical effect.\n\nThere are several villages around the shores of the bay. I should like to get inland and look at the Capital. The Harbour is very lively today. More Transports have come in, and naval pinnaces are all over the place, towing boat loads of soldiers. I should dearly love for Charley to be transferred to this station. I could then hope to see something of him. I think I shall try the Admiral.\n\nFriday 16th April \n\nToday has been spent in practising landing, etc. First the 7th Battery disembarked 12 horses by means of ships into a punt, then gun and lumber and 2 wagons and limbers into another punt. These were towed ashore by naval pinnace, horses and vehicles put ashore and afterwards reloaded on to Punts, returned to ships and reslung into hatches. After lunch the 3rd Battery did similar work, and the 3rd BAC also, so that now with the exception of Major Burgess’ battery each unit of my Brigade has had experience of landing work. Colonel Hobbs informed me today that I am to temporarily command the Batteries on this Ship, and that my batteries and Col Johnstone’s batteries are to be landed simultaneously. If we cannot beat him and ensure that the 7th Battery fires first shot I shall be disappointed. All work today most efficiently carried out and without accident, except for one man who fell off a punt and thoroughly enjoyed his swim to the gangway.\n\nI have much admired the Middys’ today handling their picket boats like old salts.\n\nSaturday 17th April\n\nWent ashore this morning with boats crew to Mudros Village. Major King and Capt Rigall accompanied me. We roamed through the village, had a good look at French troops and the quaint streets, houses and people of the Village. Major King took some photographs. We then walked round through the fields to where landing was taking place. We all picked some poppies and daisies to enclose in our last home letters. We had a look through one of the many mills in this island. They do their work exceedingly well. We saw the Mountain Batteries of the 29th Division coming ashore and after seeing their work I am convinced our Field batteries can \"run rings\" round them and could come into action in many minutes less than these folk appear to do. The Contrast was very marked today. Our ship has today handed over six life boats to the \"Suffolk\". She was evidently short and we had more than we required. Quite a sensation\n\nwas caused here by news received today. A Turkish Torpedo boat which evidently came out from Smirna intercepted the Transport \"Manitou\" from Alexandria, ordered her troops and crew to take to boats prior to being sunk. About 60 troops and crew crowded into a lifeboat, but the davits collapsed and precipitated the occupants of the boat into the water. In the meantime the Torpedo boat had sighted Transport \"Osiris\" also from Alexandria, and steamed off to treat her in like manner. Her captain however managed to escape, and in the excitement the first steamer also escaped. Both arrived here today. I understand the 60 men were drowned, but whether as a result of the accident or because in steaming away to save the rest they had to be sacrificed I do not know.\n\nWe hear that in all probability we shall be moving to our goal on Monday. I have been carefully marking on my maps position of enemy’s guns and trenches as discovered by Aeroplane Reconnaissance, and after afternoon tea I lectured to the Officers in the Saloon, showing them what they were up against. Received letter from Charley.\n\nSunday 18th April\n\nAn easy day. Some boat loads of men went ashore, several officers with them. Corporal Hare conducted Service in the evening. A very good muster including ships officers and an excellent address. Saw Colonel Hobbs and General Birdwood on the \"Minnewarka\" during the afternoon. Received letter from Alvord.\n\nMonday 19th April\n\nVery useful work done today. Several punt loads of Horses went ashore (72 Horses in all including Jack & Dick). They had a good swim and roll, also a feed of splendid clover. All transhipping done without hitch or accident. Major Hughes moved a Section to forward hold so as to admit of both holds working vehicles and horses simultaneously. Attended conference on \"Minnewarka\" at 4.30 PM. Operation Order No 1 issued and carefully considered. Further conference of Brigade Commanders arranged for Wednesday morning. Combined naval and Military Signal book issued with Amendments and Additions. The following British ships (exclusive of submarines, Torpedo boats and Destroyers) are to cooperate in attack: - \"Queen Elizabeth\", \"Agamemnon\", \"Lord Nelson\", \"Vengeance\", \"Triumph\", \"Prince of Wales\", \"Albion\", \"Goliath\", \"Blenheim\", \"Hussar\", \"Ark Royal\", \"Swiftsure\", \"Cornwallis\", \"Canopus\", \"Implacable\", \"London\", \"Queen\",\n\n\"Prince George\", \"Majestic\", \"Inflexible\", \"Dartmouth\", \"Dublin\", \"Talbot\", \"Doris\", \"Minerva\", \"Sapphire\", \"Amethyst\", \"Euryalus\", \"Bacchante\", \"Adamant\". Quite a substantial list, and one capable of giving the Turk something to remember. Dined on the \"Minnewarka\", and afterwards had conference with Colonel Hobbs.\n\nTuesday 20th April\n\nConference of my Battery Commanders at 10AM. Carefully went through all Orders and instructions with them. Very blowy day, no work possible outside ship. Wrote letters, probably the last for some time, to Charley, Alvord, Chris, Father & Mother and Nell.\n\nWednesday 21st April\n\nVery rough this morning. Conference on \"Minnewarka\" at 9 AM. C.O.s did not reach there till 10. I had an exciting row across in one of our ship boats. The Admiral as well as General Birdwood and Bridges addressed us, and went carefully into the details of our landing. The 3rd Infantry Brigade which is to be the covering force is to land about 4 AM. And carry the position at the point of the bayonet. The main body expects to be disembarked by 8.30, and then my ship is the first to discharge Artillery. If we have anything like luck my Brigade will fire the first Australian Angry Field Artillery round. The 7th Battery is up against it, and I am looking to them to do well. We have received our sailing instructions today, which show that we are to be in our Berth for discharge on the Gallipoli Peninsula Coast near Gaba Tepe at 8.30 AM on Friday 23rd inst.\n\nLater instructions came this afternoon, notifying a postponement of operations till Saturday 24th inst. This is on account of the rough weather, but as sea and wind have now gone down the Admiral May tomorrow revert to his original intention. We are all impatient to be at it. Everybody getting packing done for shore work, and rations for men and horses issued.\n\nThursday 22nd April\n\nStill lying at anchor. One of our Transports stuck on the mud in the Bay, and so far they have been unable to pull her off. Chief Engineer and Third Officer today took photographs of officers grouped on Bridge deck. They have turned out very well. Received letter from Chris. Replied at once to him and enclosed photo of self and two officers in Goat Skin Coats, also picture of \"Queen Elizabeth\". Capt Jopp and orderly reported to \"Minnewarka\" at 12 noon for duty with Colonel Hobbs as\n\nForward Observing Officers. Party of A.B. Seaman, Petty Officer and Chief Gunner reported to me today from H.M.S. Bacchante for working of Horse boats. Detailed information from Lord Kitchener to Gen Sir Ian Hamilton re victory in Mesopotamia. Turks fought bravely and had to be turned out of their positions at the point of the Bayonet.\n\nQuite a large Australian mail arrived today, everybody delighted. Captain has just given permission for 1st and 2nd Officers of this ship with crews to work launches when towing horse and gun boats ashore. We want to \"bag\" them to work our ship if possible, for we want to work against time and land on Batteries first. We want, or rather, I want to ensure one of my batteries firing the first shot from Field Artillery. Troop ship just entered the Harbour and passed us, carrying troops wearing a red Tarbouch. They look very much like Egyptian troops.\n\nFriday 23rd April\n\nChief Officer secured a Tug yesterday and was appointed her Skipper to assist in towing troops ashore at Gallipoli Peninsula. The Second Officer is with him also to act as relief Skipper, and a crew of firemen etc also went from this ship. The chief went off this morning at &AM. Standing on his bridge giving orders he was as proud as a peacock and as \"happy as Larry\". We left our anchorage a few minutes after 4, and steamed to an anchorage in the outer harbour outside the boom.\n\nWe lined troops on deck and saluted Men O’ War as we passed down between them and the Transports. The sight this evening was really beautiful, a glassy sea, several Transports anchored and others moving into anchorages in the outer Harbour, some Transports moving out to sea towing horse boats etc, escorted by three Men O’ War, British, French and Russian, Torpedo destroyers and Submarines and no end of Transports, and then just to make the picture complete a fine large waterplane manoeuvred over us in the setting sun. As darkness fell, a large Hospital ship lying outside turned on her lights. All her ports are screwed with glass, and a large Red Cross device in red lamps is emblazoned on her side. The reflection in the water is very pretty. Then to finish off the whole scene the search lights on shore lit up the entrance to the Bay where booms are stretched across. Ahead of us out to sea are Destroyers and Torpedo boats also a couple of Men O’ War acting as sentries over us. I don’t know when I have seen a finer sight. I should say\n\nthere were about 150 craft of all kinds, Men O’ War and Transports.\n\nWe saw an amusing incident this afternoon. As the three above mentioned Men O’ War headed by the Flagship were proceeding line ahead, the second ship crossed over very close in front of the bows of a moving Transport. \n\nAs the ship passed us we noticed Signals flashing from the Flag Ship Search lights and I read the following message. \"You should not have crossed the bows of the Transport in the narrows. It was unnecessary and unseamanlike\". So someone got a wigging for the manoeuvre.\n\nThe Attack on Gallipoli Peninsula is timed for Sunday morning, and we are to remain at Anchor here tomorrow and leave about 1 AM on Saturday night arriving off the Gallipoli coast in time to commence our disembarkation about 8.30 AM. We shall spend tomorrow in overhauling all our equipment seeing that everything is secure and ready for transhipment to Horse and gunboats. Posted my last letter to Nell and Chris and a card to Alvord.\n\nSaturday 24th April\n\nAt Anchor in Outer Harbour. Early in the morning Transports and Men O’ war commenced to move out from Mudros Bay. The most impressive sight was between two and three o’clock. At 2PM the \"Queen Elizabeth\" steamed out flying the Flag of Vice Admiral De Roebeck. Then followed the \"Queen\" flying the flag of Rear Admiral Thursby, who is in charge of the Fleet actually assisting our Army Corps, then five other ships including the \"Triumph\", \"Majestic\" and \"Bacchante\", who are all covering our landing. Then following came seven Destroyers, 3 of the Beagle Class, and 4 of older pattern. They made a very fine show. Two Hospital Ships came in today making 5 in all of a total capacity of 2500 beds. Evidently serious casualties are expected.\n\nAt 4.30 this afternoon I addressed all troops on board and wished them well in the ensuing operations. After dinner tonight a church service was conducted by a leading Seaman of the Navy (who is on board with some details for handling Horse and Gun boats) and Corporal Hare.\n\nCorporal Hare in particular gave a very fine address. It did one good to hear the men singing \"Nearer my God to Thee\", \"Stand up, Stand up for Jesus\", \"God be with you till we meet again\", \"God Save the King\" and \"Auld Lang Syne\". The air tonight seems electrical. Everybody is in splendid spirit and ready for tomorrow’s momentous happenings.\n\nWe leave here during the night and by daylight should be off the Gallipoli coast, and, we hope, watching the landing of our Second Brigade Infantry, the First (3rd) Brigade being landed by daylight.\n\nWe shall all endeavour to get a good night’s rest. Goodness knows when we will get our next, perhaps it May be a very long night for some of us. We can only do our best, and I am sure everybody will do that. I wonder whether there will be any further entries in this Diary.\n","193":"\n\nAfter some days’ fighting I now have an opportunity to post up my Diary, but events have crowded upon us so fast that I am sure I shall not be able to record half of what I know would be intensely interesting could I remember.\n\nSunday 25th April\n\nWent up on Captain’s Bridge at 1.15AM, left Mudros at 1.25 AM. I turned out at 5.15AM and heard the heavy booming of guns. The much looked for attack on Gallipoli Peninsula had at last commenced and our turn to fight has come. We watched the Bombardment at Cape Helles till 8.30, and what an Inferno it seemed. Ships belching out flame and loud report, and shell bursting on land with a terrific detonation. Then we steamed into our allotted position beside HMS \"Queen\" for anchorage opposite Gaba Tepe point. We could see our fellows scaling the hill sides, and at intervals saw groups doubling through a Wheat Field on the extreme right flank, and getting up on to the sky line of the ridges. Shrapnel was bursting over them, but these particular men seemed to have a charmed life and all seemed to escape bullets. The stretch of water between the ships and the shore, through which all boats carrying troops had to pass, and also boats bringing wounded back to the Hospital ships was literally bespattered with Shrapnel, apparently from guns located at Gaba Tepe, from which position they could enfilade the beaches.\n\nAt 9.30, 6\" guns opened fire on the Transports which were anchored. The first four shells, apparently ranging rounds, fell about 500 yards from our ship. Our fellows let out a derisive cheer, but soon became subdued and a little more concerned. Three single rounds were next fired, falling much nearer to us, then two salvos of three each. On shell fell under our bow, 20 yards away, while two groups of three fell about 10 yards on either side of the ship, and one shell fell 5 yards from a Torpedo boat. Our men now began to realise that being shelled while the ship was stationery, and being unable to answer back, was no joke. Luckily no damage was done but we \"upanchored\" and steamed out at 10.15 keeping under weigh till 12 noon. All the time we were impatiently waiting a signal from the\n\n\"Queen\" to take up our Anchorage again. Mean while HMS \"Triumph\" and \"Bacchante\" carried on a rigorous bombardment of Gaba Tepe in an endeavour to stop the guns that were shelling the beach and landing parties. A little before 1 Pm we received the Signal to move into our allotted Anchorage. I did not wait for the naval boats to come alongside, but after issuing the necessary instructions to the battery Commander concerning the landing of their guns, I disembarked in a ship’s boat manned by a volunteer crew from our 3rd Brigade Ammunition Column, who were for the present to remain on the Ship. I took 18 men of my Head Quarters staff, my medical Officer (Capt Marks) and my orderly officer (Lieut Richards). The Adjutant had gone ashore earlier with Col Hobbs. Shrapnel fell round us on the journey to the shore, but no one was hit. One of the boat party however on returning to the ship was caught by a shrapnel bullet, hitting him in the mouth and passing down his chest. The wound is not considered very serious.\n\nImmediately on landing I instructed my party to secure a sheltered position under the cliffs, while I reported to Col Hobbs, and was informed the General had decided no Artillery was to land during the day. I was very much upset over this decision for I was hoping to get our guns into position today. Col White then commandeered me, gave me an officer as Adjutant, and instructed me to collect all Infantry stragglers, (many of whom were coming back to the beach from the firing line assisting wounded comrades) form them up and get them to the Right Flank. I met Colonel Lee of the 9th Battalion, who was in a terrible state of mind and assured me his Battalion had been practically wiped out. I gathered together all the Infantry I could find who were unwounded, and used them to unload ammunition for use of firing line and to carry same up. The Indian mountain guns just above me on the hills were pounding away in great style, but I hear have suffered many casualties.\n\nIn view of the Generals’ decision that no guns should come ashore today instructions were sent to Col Johnstone of 2nd Bde, and Major Hughes of my Brigade to defer disembarkation. Col Johnstone was however under weigh with one gun, so he was allowed to land, and got his gun into action close to the beach, against guns at Gaba Tepe, and he undoubtedly temporarily silenced them.\n\nAt 5 PM I informed Col White I had carried out the task allotted to me in gathering up Infantry, and then proceeded to thoroughly reconnoitre the Right Flank position which seemed a naturally strong position, and one which I had carefully studied from the Ship while waiting to disembark. At this time there was plenty of shrapnel and rifle bullets flying round\n\nand also, many dead men. It was generally a very hot time. I shall never forget the sight of hundreds of wounded, in all sorts of conditions, lying on stretchers on the beach, awaiting to be taken off to the Hospital Ships. The actual details of the landing of the 3rd Brigade Covering Force I know little about, but the information concerning that will doubtless be made public in detail.\n\nThe first reconnaissance was a weird and fascinating experience. My trusty Bligh accompanied me all round. We traversed deep ravines, and climbed steep cliffs, carrying nothing but a Sam Browne belt, and a stick, yet I had a hard job to negotiate the hills. How our fellows ever fought their way over these ravines and cliffs will ever remain a mystery to me. Their tracks were marked by discarded packs, picks, shovels and equipment generally. They found it necessary to travel \"light\", with their rifle and bayonet only. Their tracks too were sadly marked by dead and wounded casualties. The Stretcher bearers did marvellous and glorious work. The Beaches at the time were a mass of Staff officers, stores, wounded, fresh troops etc. I wish I had a photograph of this scene as I saw it.\n\nI returned to Head Quarters just before dark, and told Col Hobbs what I had done, and that I could find suitable places for batteries. Both the Col and Major Anderson questioned the possibility of doing what I said I could do, they having according to their own statement previously been over the ground. In discussing the matter fully I ascertained they had not been within a mile of the line I had reconnoitred. I again carefully tramped over the ground, Bligh accompanying me, and later reported to Col Hobbs and General Bridges that I could use Artillery effectively on extreme Right Flank. The General agreed to let me have two Batteries but afterwards altered to 2 guns, and then cancelled altogether. I had in my reconnaissance conferred with Col Onslow Thompson, Colonel Garside and Col Bolton as to enemy’s position, and they were delighted when I informed them I was to bring up Artillery. We had waited on the beach all night for the two guns to be landed and did not know till 5.30AM that arrangements had been cancelled. No sleep the first night. If I had had a chance I am sure I could not have slept under the conditions.\n\nMy Head Quarters men worked like Trojans making a roadway up to the Green Field I have previously referred to, and very excellent work they did. Towards morning drizzling rain began to fall, and in addition the air was very cold, so our first night at Gallipoli was not too pleasant.\n\nMonday 26th April\n\nEarly in the morning 1 gun of 1st Battery under Major Sweetland and 1 gun of 4th Battery under Lieut Siddall came into action on the extreme right of ridge (Low Scrub Hill) overlooking Gaba Tepe. The 4th Battery did excellent work all day against Infantry targets ranging from very close ranges to about 1000 yards. Lt Irwin did good work with 1st Battery gun, but the Major in charge proved a great disappointment, but I do not want to say more here. Later in the morning 4 guns and wagons of 7th Battery came ashore and I at once ordered two of that Battery’s guns into position, making a complete Composite Battery. There also came ashore 2 guns of 3rd Battery and 4 guns of 8th Battery. These latter had evidently come ashore in error and were ordered back to their Ships by Col Hobbs. I also, later in the afternoon, ordered back 1st Battery and 4th Battery guns, replacing them with the remaining two guns of 7th Battery, thus having this Battery complete on the position. The Infantry was very happy to see Artillery. Our position was absolutely in the Infantry trenches and on the sky line and of course there was no Infantry in front of our guns. It would have been quite useless to come into action behind the Infantry as then in order to clear the crest we should have had to fire at nothing less than 3000 yards, and our chief targets were from 500 to 1000 yards. The day was very exciting, and our shooting was a marked contrast to Practice camp work where every round is husbanded most carefully. Each gun fired during the day about 400 rounds. All our officers and men stood up to the ordeal splendidly. Got our Telephone communications established with Head Quarters. I was with my orderly Bligh lying down on the crest in a small hole which is later to become my Head Quarters when an Infantryman came rushing over to me bringing a message from Brigadier McKay. Just as he reached within a few yards of me he fell mortally wounded with a rifle bullet. The next instant my two linesman who were completing the laying of telephone cable came to the spot with their heavy reel, and hearing bullets singing past, they made one leap into my hiding place, and with their reel fell in a heap on top of me – and they weren’t very light either.\n\nWe spent the night entrenching. Beautiful sight, Search lights and big fleet of Transports and Men O’ War making an ensemble that will never be effaced from the memory of those who were privileged to see it. On the one side Peace – on the other rifle, machine gun and artillery fire.\n\nThe fleet bombarded the enemy’s position during the evening. Quiet night. I am in a strong position, though a tactically unsound one, my guns being actually in the Infantry firing line. Colonel Hobbs this evening seemed much affected, and expressed his sincere thanks for my assistance.\n\nTuesday 27th April\n\nI have assisted Major Hughes throughout the night with his different guns as well as yesterday and nobody has had any sleep. At 3.30 AM while I was controlling one of the guns we received word that the enemy were massing in a piece of scrub land about 5 acres in extent. I immediately opened fire and thoroughly searched this area using in all 36 rounds of shrapnel. We heard yells and cries of \"Allah\" and we know we got into a nest of Turks preparing for a morning attack. These rounds drew fire from the Dardanelles, in the vicinity of Fort 32, but whether from forts or ships we could not ascertain. Twelve rounds were fired, apparently 6\" or 8\". Six rounds fell among the Transports but no damage was done. We have had a fairly quiet day, both sides digging hard. We engaged Infantry several times successfully. Fairly quiet night. Both Infantry in the trenches and gunners ready for any attack. Turks attacked twice but were repulsed. We used shrapnel effectively, sometimes at Zero. Plenty of dead Turks lying in the Field immediately to our left front, some being no more than 25 yards from our Infantry line. I am informed that among our killed are Colonel MacLaurin and his Brigade major, Major Irvine, also Col Clarke and Col Onslow Thompson. The fleet again bombarded. Our Brigade Ammunition Column has been and is doing excellent work in supplying ammunition by hand to the guns. They have about half a mile to carry it, and in that half mile rise 400 feet, and at the same time have to cross a bullet swept area.\n\nWednesday 28th April\n\nSearched gullies again just at dawn and got a good few Turks. Steady shelling all day. Repeating previous days’ work. Twice during the night shelled massing Infantry. We have fired about 1800 rounds to date. In view of our peculiar position, having 187° of open country to watch, I have an officer fighting each gun singly, so that fire can be directed on any point at a second’s notice.\n\nThis is giving splendid experience to No 1 and section Commanders.\n\nThursday 29th April\n\nFairly steady day. \"Bacchante\" shelled trenches on contour 400 and did excellent shooting. Enemy preparing trenches against Left flank. Heavy cannonade of enemy’s artillery about 5.30 PM. The navy at once responded. Enemy’s battery of six field guns (about 14 ½ pr) seems to be getting plenty of shrapnel. As yet we have been unable to\n\nlocate it. Adjutant taken to assist General Cunliffe Owen.\n\nCol Hobbs and Col Christian came up this afternoon to our position. As the Turks came along Contour 400 in good number, we were able to give them an afternoon’s experience of unique character. Col Christian had a few shots with a rifle and affirms he laid out a couple of Turks. All our people very exhausted. I have had no sleep since landing. Have arranged for portion of 8th and","194":" Battery personnel to take a few days on 7th Battery guns, partly to relieve the","195":" personnel and partly to give them experience.\n","196":"\n\nComparatively quiet morning. Col MacLagan with","197":" Infantry Brigade relieved troops on this flank. Generals Birdwood, bridges and Walker with me inspecting position and discussing situation. This afternoon enemy again came along Contour 400 in fairly large numbers. We opened fire using about 80 rounds, getting good effect. A 6\" gun opened fire on us about 5 o’clock from our Right Flank. Capt Leslie engaged it with time shrapnel, also HMS \"London\" but latter would not correct line. Enemy fired 4 rounds and then ceased. We had a fairly quiet night.\n\nThe casualties to date in our Brigade areas follows:-\n","198":" - Fitter Legeant - ","199":" B.A.C. - Shrapnel bullet through mouth.\n","200":" - Gunner Eagle - ","201":" Battery - Bullet through leg.\n","202":" -Sergt Braithwaite -","203":" Battery - Bullet through left shoulder.\n","204":" - Corporal Bliss - ","205":" Battery - Bullet over shoulder blade.\n","206":" - Gunner Coleman -","207":" B.A.C. - Bullet through left thigh\n","208":" -Sergt Day - ","209":" Battery - Bullet through right thigh.\n","210":" -Gr Steglitz - ","211":" Battery - Bullet through thigh.\n","212":" - Fitter Price - ","213":" Battery - Bullet graze at eye.\n","214":"\n\nA quiet night. One attack only, and only once did we Loose off guns. During the day the enemy were observed removing equipment from their dead. In cases where we could locate a number the guns spoke. Major Bergen’s gun located and destroyed two machine gun sand bagged emplacements. Capt Rogers gun located transport and shelled it. The 6\" gun on our Right Flank again began talking, also another gun from a position further north. Their observer audaciously came up on the sky line and in consequence got a shell from Rogers. They appear to shift their guns at night. Major Browne brought a section ashore ready for a forward movement tomorrow. It has been bad luck that the balance of guns of my Brigade have up till now not been allowed to land.\n","215":"\n\nJust a week ashore. Time does fly along. An advance intended for tomorrow. This will give us a first class position for Artillery observation. The 6\" gun again opened on us this morning but from a new position. We have not yet located it. Major Burgess this morning took on Artillery coming into action, and Lieut Crisp machine guns in action. As I write bullets are \"pinging\" over our \"dugout\". We are really very comfortable at our Head Quarters. We have one \"dugout\" as our office, which contains all our Telephone Service. Connected close to it we have a general living room about 9’ x 9’ and about 6 feet deep, covered with sandbags and earth. In one wall we have three wooden ammunition boxes, built in to hold our rations, glasses, revolvers and any other small articles of Kit.\n\nOn this ridge a number of small pine trees are growing, and Bligh has covered the floor with a thick layer of young branches, so we quite imagine from the smell we might be in the heart of a pine Forest. We are safe here from shrapnel fire, but of course not from heavy shell or high explosive shell. I had my first shave this morning since leaving the ship, also my first really good wash and a change of underlinen. They sent off my dressing case from the ship, for when we landed last Sunday we brought nothing except a bed and what we stood up in.\n\nToday has been generally quiet. We dug alternative emplacements for our guns so that we can withdraw them if necessary. They will be properly sandbagged tomorrow. Position selected on Hill to my left for Major Browne to bring one gun into action. Engineers and Infantry prepared roadway and assisted our gunners to drag up the first gun and limber. Then I made arrangements for a second gun of 8th Battery. The getting of the second gun into position was much delayed because one of the enemy’s 4 gun batteries opened rapid shrapnel fire on the beach and kept everybody under cover for some time. As far as I know no casualties were reported. I expect this gun will get into action tonight and I have supplied the section with 600 rounds shrapnel just \"to go on with\". Our 3rd Brigade is doing admirably and I am exceedingly proud of my Command. I only hope I May be spared to lead it till the end of the war.\n\nWhile I was busy on the phone tonight growling at the Staff Captain because he had not secured us 500 sandbags for entrenching as promised, I was told a mail was in. One cannot imagine how delighted we all were. I received a letter from Alvord dated 21st","216":" from Nell dated Feby 9th, March 21st and March 22nd, also one from Arthur King\n\nMelbourne, Robson & Cowlishaw acknowledging medical Certificate, and one from A.T. Sharp London, saying he was sending my long wanted \"Orilux lamp. Also a letter from Father and Mother and one from Mrs Parker, widow of Major Parker in answer to a letter of condolence I had written her.\n\nI have been quite happy in my service with the guns for the past eek, though nights without sleep naturally leave one weary, particularly too when the position has been such an anxious one, but the reading of all my letters tonight made me feel somewhat unmanned. All contained prayers for my Safe Keeping. My letter from the dear old dad was perhaps the best I have ever received from him. The circumstances are unique. I read them all in my little \"dugout\" with an ammunition box for a seat and a candle on another box at about 9.30PM. The Navy’s guns were booming out in terrific fashion at the Southern end of Gallipoli peninsula, my four guns were talking within a few yards of me, and as every round was fired dust and dirt fell from the roof of my \"cabin\". The enemy’s and our rifles at the same time keeping up an incessant crackle. Of course just as I got settled to read my letters, staff officers, telephonists etc must come bothering me about something or other, while I wanted to be alone. I would give up a great deal if I could see all my family tonight. My heart is very full. The sights and experiences of the past week are indelibly stamped in my memory and can never be effaced.\n\nOur attack scheme on Contour 400 set down for today has been postponed.\n\nMonday 3rd May\n\nHeavy cannonade this morning by navy. Our guns also at work early. I hear the enemy inflicted losses on our 4th Brigade about 5 A.M. this morning. The old 6\" guns on our right flank again opened and fired a few rounds, but No 1 gun 7th battery stopped here. Heavy guns from direction of Fort 32 on the Dardanelles also fired many rounds at Transports and Men O’ War. One transport appeared to be hit, but not seriously damaged. General Bridges with naval officers and Col MacLagan also myself discussed sending demolition party to Gaba Tepe at 4.30 AM tomorrow. Navy to land men, who will be covered by our Artillery fire and that from destroyers. Fresh gun emplacements being made for alternative use. Major Browne now connected up by Phone. His two guns are in action. The 6\" gun again opened fire this evening, but we located and stopped him. So far he has done no damage. The shells are lead coated and have no copper driving bands.\n\nA very quiet night and little shooting.\n","217":"\n\nAt 3.30 AM this morning I engaged enemy’s Infantry on Shrapnel ridge. At 4.30 AM party from 3rd Infantry Brigade landed on beach at Kaba Tepe, but were met by heavy machine gun fire.\n\nDestroyers and my guns peppered the point thoroughly, but it appeared unwise to carry the attempt any further, so troops were returned in boats to the Destroyers. Bullets flew all around them, and from our gun positions we could see the whole drama. Altogether I Understand eight were killed including one officer and 18 wounded. I expect Kaba Tepe will eventually be taken from the land side. A battery came into action yesterday about 1700* distant, and let us have our first taste of shrapnel. Fortunately no harm was done. Mr Crisp located him again this morning. His men were busy making emplacements and their picks were visible. They did not remain there long. A pinnace went out about noon from the navy to bury dead from morning’s operations, under cover of Red Cross flag. They were not fired upon. At 2.30 Turks carrying Red Crescent searched for the dead and wounded. They were also not fired upon by us. Major Hughes personnel resumed duty on their guns at 4PM. Major Burgess’ personnel relieved for a few days. I heard unofficially today that Lieut Clowes and three gunners of 8th Battery had been wounded in action, but I have no definite details. There is also an unconfirmed rumour that Lieut Morgan is a casualty. A very quiet night. Both Lt Richards and myself had a good sleep. \n","218":"\n\nVery quiet during last night and this morning. We know the Turks are busy entrenching. This morning I visited Section of our line where Major Browne has two guns. Saw Col Hobbs there also Colonel Johnstone. I think his position will turn out to be a good one and work in well with ours. On my return I met General Birdwood and Admiral Thursby. They wanted to see Kaba Tepe from landward. There has been a certain amount of activity on this point all day and No1 gun has been giving them attention. Deepening all our trenches for further security and improving approaches and exits for guns should they require to be moved. Today collected all 18pr shell cases for return to Ordnance. Operation order no 5 issued today. It provides for the transfer of two Brigades Infantry and details to Cape Helles tonight to assist 29th Division, our line in consequence being \n\ndivided into two Sections instead of three. We are in No 1 Section, Commanded by Col MacLagan DSO Further casualties to date in the Brigade are as follows: - \n\nGunner Morgan - 8th Battery - Bullet wound right forearm - April 26th\n\nGunner Bowles - \" - Bullet wound - May 3rd\n\nLieut M.Clowes - \" - Bullet wound right chest - May 3rd\n\nGunner N. Piesse - \" - Bullet wound, right upper arm -May 3rd\n\nGunner W.C. Fincher - \" - Bullet wound right leg - May 4th\n\nHutchinson & Murdoch reported for duty from \"Cardiganshire\" 4 PM.\n\nFriday 7th May\n\nWill now continue Diary where I left off at 4.30 PM 5th inst.\n\nWednesday 5th May (continued)\n\nA momentous afternoon for Major Burgess and myself. During the morning I had instructed Major Burgess to make a reconnaissance of our trenches on the Left with the object of finding a good observation post in the vicinity of Contour 400, from which to direct fire of 7th Battery. He returned to my Head Quarters about 4.45 PM and commenced to tell me all about his reconnaissance. About 5PM a few percussion and time shrapnel shell fell around us and as Major Burgess was sitting on the floor in the centre of my dugout I suggested he had better sit close against the wall with me. At about 5.15 PM a shell struck the roof of the \"dugout\" in the corner and burst on entry. Both Burgess and myself were momentarily stunned by the shock of the explosion. I heard Burgess say \"Are you alright Colonel\", I replied \"Yes, are you hurt\". I got no reply but found Burgess had swooned. He had a nasty gash in his neck, another on the side of his face and his face covered with gravel and blood. I stanched the bleeding with a clean towel I had handy and sent for our medical officer. He came with his Assistants and attended to Burgess. In the meantime I discovered my own head was bleeding profusely and I also had a fragment in my right knee. I managed to get down to the Dressing station of the 3rd Infantry Brigade which was close to us. Their medical officer dressed my wounds and sent me to the Clearing Hospital on the beach. Two men (one my batman Bligh) assisted me along. In passing I want to record how proud I was of Capt Leslie and Lieut Ross with their detachment. Even while shell were falling all around them, they served their guns quite coolly, located the enemy, and wiped out two of his guns. I had to wait till 7.30 PM for \n\na launch to take me off to the Hospital Ship \"Gloucester Castle\". About 20 wounded went off with me. A strong wind and heavy sea had sprung up, and we all got a good wetting and tossing about before reaching the ship. Then there was great difficulty in getting aboard. I managed to scramble up the Companionway but all the others were lying down cases and had to be lifted into the ship in slings with steam tackle. When the doctor came to overhaul me, he found my injuries to consist of severe contusions on head, neck, shoulders and back, (due to the blast of explosion having forced gravel from roof through my coat, woollen vest, shirt and singlet, these garments being a wreck!) a bullet wound under right shoulder in the back, a bullet in upper left arm and another in right knee. He located all three bullets or perhaps pieces of gravel, and luckily my knee joint is not affected. All wounds were very painful during the night. Especially back, which was just as if I had received a severe thrashing. One of Major Hughes men (a telephonist) was hit in the arm with shrapnel about the same time as I was hit. Both Major Burgess and myself cannot understand how we escaped death. The explosions occurred in a \"dugout\" about 9’ X 9’ or less. A kerosene bucket in the middle off the room was riddled as also was my Sam Browne belt and other equipment, while the wall opposite where we were sitting is badly damaged and punctured. We have both come to the conclusion that we surely are not destined to be killed by shrapnel. I do not forget the letter I received the other day, in all of which I was told prayers were daily offered for my safety. Is my escape due to them? My head is still in a whirl, due I suppose to the shock of explosion in a confined space. Some of our troops (2800) with 2 batteries transferred tonight to 29th Division, Cape Helles.\n","219":"\n\nAbout 8 o’clock this morning my servant (Bligh) came off from the shore with my effects, and later went off to the \"Cardiganshire\" and got the remainder of my kit. The Senior Medical Officer, Col Ryan, has ordered me to return to Alexandria or Cairo as May be convenient, to have X rays applied to my wounds to locate bullets. When extracted perhaps a week will see me fit enough to return. I am very anxious not to lose any of the show. Major Burgess came on board at 10AM with a launch of wounded, included in which was Capt Leslie. Early this morning\n\na shrapnel shell caught him, smashed his thigh terribly, and badly damaged his head and chest. He died at 2 PM mainly from shock, tho’ the medical officer stated he could not possibly have survived his injuries. I feel awfully sorry. He has done most excellent work during the 11 days we have been fighting. I hear we are to leave tomorrow for Alexandria.\n","220":"\n\nLeft Anchorage at Kaba Tepe about 8 AM, bound for Alexandria. Beautiful weather. Dr dressed my wounds, probing bullet wounds and extracting gravel gave me fits, as also the subsequent painting with iodine. I feel fairly comfortable, but back and knee very stiff and sore. \n\nSaturday 8th May\n\nAbout 700 wounded officers and men on Board with the exception of 166 British and 7 Indians all are Australian. Many very sad cases of terrible wounds. Another man died today. Doctor applied hot fomentation to my wounds, much to my relief.\n\nBeautiful day and smooth sea.\n\nSunday 9th May\n\nAnother beautiful day. Back and wounds generally feeling much easier. Arrived at Alexandria about 3 PM. Hospital train waiting alongside Quay. About 250 stowed into first train which left Alexandria at 7.15 PM and arrived in Cairo at 11 PM. Three nurses, doctor and Indian attendants on board looked after men. Provided Bovril, coffee, fruit and cigarettes. Bligh accompanied me. Major Burgess stayed on ship, but I heard later went into Hospital at Alexandria. Motor ambulance took us to Heliopolis Hospital. Had wounds dressed and turned into bed at 12 midnight. Slept splendidly. \n\nMonday 10th May\n\nCabled Nell telling of wounds. Wrote Charley. Mrs Christian and Harris called to see me during afternoon and in the evening Col Ryrie, Col Cox, Major Lynch and Lieut Hogue spent a half hour with me.\n\nTuesday 11th May\n\nWrote Nell, father & mother and Alvord. Capt Doody, half \n\nbrother to our Dr Marks had along yarn with me. Mrs Sweetland, King and Rabett called on me. Wounds not feeling too well. Have to get a Skiagraph taken tomorrow. High Commissioner and Lady McMahon visited the Hospital.\n\nWednesday 12th May\n\nMr Pengelly called to see me also Mrs Mackworth. Wrote Arthur King, Melbourne. Had an X ray taken of wounds. Discovered lumps of gravel. Put me on the operating table and removed them. Nurse in attendance on the Surgeon Col Downes, proved to be Mrs Rogers, wife of Capt Rogers 8th battery.\n\nThursday 13th May\n\nThe Sultan visited the Hospital this morning, accompanied by Sir John Maxwell, Commanding troops in Egypt. Wounds progressing well.\n\nFriday 14th May\n\nAli Bey called to see me today, bringing with him a beautiful bunch of flowers. He was greatly concerned to hear of my being wounded. \n\nSaturday 15th May\n\nMr & Mrs Pengelly called to see me, and invited me to come and spend a week at their home. Mrs Pengelly who was trained as a nurse promised to dress my wounds generally.\n\nSunday 16th May\n\nAfter lunch took train to Mena. Mr Pengelly’s man met me with his trap and drove me home.\n\nMonday 17th May\n\nLounged about all day reading. Sang a few songs in the afternoon.\n\nTuesday 18th May\n\nReceived cable from Nell in answer to mine. Again reading all day. Wound in back feeling very sore. I think there is still some foreign substance in the wound.\n\nWednesday 19th May\n\nWent in to Heliopolis Hospital. Doctor again examined wound in back and found it unsatisfactory. He probed it, and extracted two lumps of gravel that had not previously been noticed.\n\nThursday 20th May\n\nReading all day. Had dinner with Col Springthorpe at Mena Hospital, and gave the patients (about 300) an account of Gaba Tepe action from an artillery point of view. All seemed very interested. Got Col Springthorpe to call and see Mr Pengelly - he is not at all well, and is terribly afraid he has lung trouble.\n\nI heard today that General Bridges had died as result of wounds.\n\nFriday 21st May\n\nWent into Cairo to have a few articles of kit repaired and get some signal message forms for my Brigade. Went to Hospital had wounds dressed and was discharged. Wounds will not be healed for perhaps 2 weeks, but do not now require much attention, and I am anxious to get back. Had dinner at Continental Hotel. Met Mrs Doctor Stokes and Mrs Major Sutton who commenced plying me with questions, so I had to tell them all I knew of Gallipoli. I have no end of letters and packages from wives for their husbands. Drew field allowance to date. Heard from Base office that to date 89 Australian officers have been killed. Stayed at Continental Hotel for the night.\n\nSaturday 22nd May\n\nLeft Cairo at 9.30 AM, reached Alexandria at 12.35 PM. Went to Majestic Hotel for lunch and there met several officers I knew. Could not get much information about the front. Went aboard the \"Derflinger\" (A.10) at 4PM. Found she was carrying over 2000 troops, and unfortunately I am the Senior Officer on board so have to take up duty as O.C. Troops. Capt McLaughlin 1st Battery is on board, so I have made him Adjutant. Ship is a captured German prize N.D. Lloyd, and very comfortable. We shall be glad however to get back to Gallipoli.\n\nSunday 23rd May\n\nOwing to delay in repair of a broken steam pipe, ship did not leave Quay till 2.30 PM. We are trying to evolve order out of chaos. Nearly every arm of the service represented by small squads. \n\nthough Infantry alone total about 1800. Some of the latter are very much a rabble, and have had too much liquor before coming aboard. At 5 PM when well out to sea we heard cries of \"man overboard\". One of the Infantry who was worse for liquor had fallen overboard. Buoys were thrown to him, ship turned about and a boat lowered. He managed to swim to one of the buoys and secure it, but he was in a bad way when lifted into the boat. Evidently he had swallowed a large amount of salt water.\n\nAssembled all officers in the saloon during afternoon and arranged details re allotting of troops to decks etc. Also read out instructions from Vice Admiral Pieise, re treatment of hostile torpedo or submarine craft. Called by the Captain at 9.30 PM A ship showing only navigation lights was manoeuvring around us in a suspicious manner, but eventually went on her course. I think she was scared of our ship (being in darkness) and kept her bow on to us till we had passed.\n\nGood night rest.\n\nMonday 24th May\n\nA beautiful day with smooth sea. Adjutant getting all units adjusted. Not an easy job with so many units represented. Careful lookout all day for submarines or Torpedo boats. Armed guard of 250 standing by with 750 men available at a minute’s notice. Expect to arrive at Mudros about 6 PM tomorrow. What a strange ‘Empire Day\". No celebrations required this year to prove the solidity of the Empire. The world’s battle fields are sufficient indication. \n\nTuesday 25th May\n\nAgain a smooth sea and a very fine day. Passed Syros early in the day and reached Mudros Bay in Lemnos Island at 4.30 PM. Anchored well up the bay. A destroyer crowded with sailors entered the boom just ahead of us. Reported to \"Hussan\" at 5PM, thence to Headquarters on \"Atlantean\". Was there informed that submarines were in the vicinity of the Dardanelles and therefore it was dangerous for transports and other large vessels to proceed there. In consequence we have to wait here till trawlers carrying about 500 men apiece can deliver us to our destination. As there are 6000 troops here we May not get away for a week. I am however trying to get upon a destroyer. \n\nWe were informed that H.M.S. Triumph was this morning torpedoed by a Submarine off Gaba Tepe, and that the sailors we saw on the Destroyer were survivors. We do not know how many casualties there were. We were also told that two nights ago the Turks, strongly reinforced, attacked our positions at Kaba Tepe at 1 AM. Our men counter attacked about an hour later and accounted for 9000 Turkish casualties, while our losses were 500. An Armistice was declared next day, the Turks burying 3000 dead. Such a heavy list of Turkish casualties makes me think our guns must have been doing good work during the night. I shall be desperately anxious to get away from this Port. I want to be with my guns.\n\nAs we are now in Port there is no trouble about darkening ship. In consequence all lights are going again. It was officially notified to us tonight that Italy has at last joined in with us and declared war against Austria. I wonder what will be the result in the Adriatic Sea. Men on board are a terribly undisciplined crowd. I have representatives of no less than 44 different units on board; some without officers, so it can be imagined how difficult it is to ensure decent troop ship discipline.\n\nWednesday 26th May\n\nMuch to my surprise 4 Torpedo Destroyers came alongside about 9 AM this morning to tranship us to Gallipoli. We bustled around and got our men aboard about noon leaving Mudros at 12.30PM. Each destroyer had about 500 men on board, my boat having 540 including 20 officers. She was named \"Harpy\". Some of these men and officers had been wounded earlier in the proceedings and were returning from Hospital. We had a beautiful trip to Gaba Tepe, quite a yachting cruise, about 50 miles at 20 knots. When we reached Gaba Tepe we were preparing to transfer into punts to be towed ashore by launches. The Turkish artillery opened on us with shrapnel firing 8 rounds. Four were effective and in a few moments we had 42 casualties on my boat, 5 being killed and 7 so badly wounded that the doctors held out no hope for them. It was a dreadful experience, and the wardroom was temporarily turned into a Hospital.\n\nLuckily we had three doctors on board.\n\nWhen I ultimately got ashore I reported immediately to General Birdwood and Col Hobbs. It was good to hear their hearty welcome, I think the more hearty because they had been watching the effect of Turkish shells on the Destroyers.\n\nMy own officers and men particularly gave me a most hearty welcome, in fact we owe it to the work of 9th Battery guns that the Turkish Artillery was silenced early. I found letters from Nell, Chis & father awaiting me.\n\nThursday 27th May\n\nSpent the day in examining our gun positions. I now have my twelve guns in action tho’ 8th Battery is temporarily attached to Col Johnstone in No 2 Section of Defence. I find my guns have done excellent work, Major Hughes acting as Brigade Commander. He will now get a few days well earned rest.\n\nI went all over No1 Section today with Col Hobbs, and tomorrow I am to inspect No 2 Section prior to taking up duty again.\n\nI will also inspect the New Zealand Section. Quite pleased to be back in the trenches again. Lieut Crisp promoted Captain and transferred to 7th Battery vice Capt Leslie killed in action.\n\nFriday 28th May\n\nMet Colonel Hobbs at Brown’s Battery at 9.30. Spent the morning with him and the two Colonel Johnstones inspecting positions. Had lunch with Col Hobbs and during the afternoon thoroughly examined the N.Z. Section. Our line appears exceptionally strong and it will require a huge army to shift us out. I am informed officially today that our casualties in the attack of a few nights ago were 283 killed and wounded. Today eighty three 6\" Howitzer common shell were landed in the vicinity of Hughes Battery, but I think only accounting for about 4 men. Extraordinary how they miss us. \n\nReceived letter from Nell dated April 21st, Home dated 17th April and Charley dated May 5th.\n\nSaturday 29th May\n\nThe enemy at 3.30 AM opened a heavy Artillery cannonade from all directions and must have fired over 1000 shell up to 5 AM, when we had managed to locate their batteries and silence them. Very little damage generally was done and very few casualties, but unfortunately two were Artillery officers, Lt Siddall of 4th Battery, and Major Bruce of Mountain Battery, both killed.\n\nLast night a destroyer shelled the approaches from our Right Flank to Gaba Tepe. One Infantry patrol went out and got some useful information, besides\n\nbayonetting six Turks and capturing one. Party returned safely. \n\nThis afternoon another Battery opened fire, but Major Burgess silenced it. Today I selected new position for Head Quarters and new Brigade observing stations in vicinity of 10th and 11the Battalion observation posts. B.A.C. detachment commenced work on \"dug outs\".\n\nVisited Head quarters at night, discussed question of N.S.W. Howitzers. Col Hobbs agreed to proposals and forwarded same officially. Very quiet night.\n\nSunday 30th May\n\nToday we celebrate the termination of our fifth week in Gallipoli. We had a quiet morning, but after lunch the enemy again bombarded us with all sorts of Artillery, large and small, but I think without doing much damage. I was fascinated watching two guns of Phillips’ Battery. For half an hour the enemy placed heavy common shell all around him, but still his guns answered back defiance, and finally silenced the larger guns. The detachments must have nerves of iron to stand up and serve their guns during such a bombardment.\n\nWent round position at junction of 1st and 2nd Sections this morning with Col Hobbs. Capt Waite took up duty as understudy to Major Hughes. Very quiet night. \n\nMonday 31st May\n\nAnother very quiet day. Information has come in to the effect that the night before last Phillips guns got into the enemy’s reserves, the casualties totalling 2000. Accompanied Colonel Hobbs around the position during morning. Instructed Burgess to select and prepare new emplacement for casemate gun. Had lunch with Major Browne. Was informed Major Mills had died of wounds received at Cape Helles. Made inspection of rear of 1st Section and made sketch of road to run round & facilitate movements of guns and bodies of troops. General approved same. Quiet day and quiet night. \n\nTuesday 1st June\n\nEnemy’s artillery fairly active, but little effect obtained. Our fellows are splendidly dug in. Conferred with Col Hobbs at Brown’s Battery re co-ordination of fire of 3rd F.A. Bde with Artillery of Second Section. Arranged to carry out an experimental shoot at 4 PM but had to postpone it because of necessary alterations to bring effective fire to bear over the area required. Gun emplacement altered during the night. Heavy rifle and bomb fusillade all the evening\n\ntill about midnight. New Head Quarters so far completed as to admit of our occupying them, and slept there for the first time.\n\nWednesday 2nd June\n\nAll Brigade telephone lines transferred to new Head Quarters station. Met Colonel Hobbs at 7th Battery. Inspected altered emplacement. Told me of a good deal of his difficulties in dealing with Headquarters. Sent in report concerning work of Capt Leslie and Lieut Ross with their detachments on May 5th and 6th recommending them to notice.\n\nAt 3.30 PM with Major Hughes met Colonel Johnstone and registered areas in front of 2nd and A&NZ Sections, notably \"Johnstones Folly\" which could not be engaged by other Batteries. By actual experiment obtained necessary data to permit of engaging these localities by day or night. Major Burgess’ battery busy on \"Olive Grove\" guns about 6 PM. Saw Major Martin re road behind our position. Arranged to meet one of his officers tomorrow and point out what is required. Very quiet night.\n\nThursday 3rd June\n\nInterview with general Carruthers explaining result of yesterday’s shoot. He was very pleased. Interviewed Engineer officers and pointed out what is required for Artillery Road. With Major Hughes tabulated result of yesterday’s shoot and recorded same on D.A. map, forwarding same to major Anderson at 10.30 AM. Heathorn and Brand returned to duty from D.A. H.Qrs. Visited Burgess’ guns this afternoon and had interview with Capt Trenchard re position of 6\" Howrs. B.A.C. detachment preparing improved Roadway from our Head Qrs to beach and to Head Qrs of 3rd Infantry Brigade. Orders today record Honours and rewards conferred by the King on some of our officers and men. All richly deserved. This afternoon H.M.S. Doris put about 100 rounds of 6\" stuff into Hill 971 and vicinity, her broadsides of 6 guns speaking at once.\n\nA very unfortunate accident happened this afternoon. Major Burgess was shooting over our own Troops, when a premature occurred, due to a faulty fuze. As a result 2 men were killed and 11 wounded, among the latter being 5 officers. Enemy attacked about 9.30 PM but were driven off with loss. We also hear the Turks attacked our Southern troops yesterday but were also beaten off with heavy loss.\n\nB.A.C. detachment at work on new track. With Major Brown selecting positions for gun emplacements, so that guns May be moved into them\n\nat any time, day or night.\n\nCol Hobbs informed me more Howitzers were being landed for us.\n\nFriday 4th June.\n\nI was awakened this morning by heavy gun fire. Evidently our people down south are storming the heights for a terribly heavy cannonade from land batteries and naval guns has been in progress all day. There are about 115 land batteries, and I anticipate at lEast 30,000 shell have been fired there today from 12\" downwards. We have been watching the cannonade and it is difficult to imagine how anything could live in the inferno there in evidence. Major Hughes has been granted a weeks rest and leaves for Lemnos this afternoon there to recuperate on the \"Mumewaska\". He has had a very strenuous time.\n\nOur men make much use of a disgusting adjective and I am always checking them. I passed a group today in an Infantry trench freely using the same word. I told them I was surprised to hear Infantry using such language. \"If you had been gunners, I could perhaps understand it,\" I said. The ringleaders reply was \"Gor Blime, we are _ _ Gunners.\" Then I found out they were a machine gun detachment. This note is to serve me as a reminder, for a Diary is hardly a fit place for such language.\n\nTonight our troops carried out certain operations. It was intended to secure and permanently occupy trench in front of \"Quinns.\" I have no knowledge of what occurred on the Left Flank, but on the Right Col MacLagan sent out patrols, who returned in due course reporting that trenches immediately to our front were unoccupied excepting for a few men. I stayed with 7th battery till 12.30 PM. I had a narrow escape from rifle bullet wound.\n\nI was talking to a Sergeant in No 2 gun emplacement when I felt a tap on my left shoulder. On examination I found a bullet had penetrated the collar of my jacket, entered the cloth again just under the shoulder strap and came out again about 2\" further on. Went round 9th Battery position with Col MacLagan, he having resumed duty to day after a short leave. Heavy Field Artillery cannonade during the night, but the result I do not yet know.\n\nSaturday 5th June\n\nEnemy’s Artillery opened early this morning. There appears to be a good deal of activity on Left Flank. Lieut Parker reported to me for posting to a Battery for instruction. Have sent him to 7th Battery. Had overhead cover provided to part of my \"dug out\". Last night secured fuze in a damaged condition from old \"dug out\", belonging to shell \n\nthat \"laid out\" Major Burgess and myself. I shall keep it as a memento, tho’ I shall require a ship to carry away all I would like to take.\n\nCapt Harris, Adjutant D.A.C. reported to me yesterday re duplicating Telephone and Signal Services between our Brigades and batteries. I had already done so in case of my Brigade. Track completed past Brighton Battery to Brigade Headquarters. Interview with Capt Trenchard, 6\" How, regarding giving of information etc. \n\nSunday 6th June\n\nA most beautiful day. The colouring of the sea has to day been a most extraordinary blue. Respirators being issued to all ranks, thus wisely guarding against the use by the Turks of asphyxiating gases as practised by the Germans. Information published in our orders today indicate that the enemy is weakening and is anxious to sue for peace. Saw Gen’s Birdwood Walker and Carruthers together with Col Hobbs and Col Johnstone at 8th Battery position.\n\nDuring the afternoon enemy put in a good deal of high explosive and shrapnel shell. We located batteries in \"Olive Grove\" and on \"Gun Ridge\" and silenced them. Capt Jopp finished duty as H.Q Officer.\n\nRather heavy rifle fusillade during night.\n\nMonday 7th June\n\nWas aroused about 5.30 AM by enemy’s guns firing on Major Brown’s gun emplacements. Mountain Battery engaged them, but 9th and 7th B.Cs could not locate target. Shortly after mountain Battery opened fire enemy’s gun ceased firing. Established today Brigade Forward Observing station with Capt Jopp in charge. He will remain in his present \"dug out\" on the position and will be relieved by Lieut Richards and W.S. Forrest at intervals, and will also have Telephonists and observers with him as well as obtain information from Infantry observation posts. This Brigade station can communicate with all Batteries and if necessary direct their fire. Naval observing officer will also observe from our Brigade station.\n\nWith Colonel Hobbs, Major Brown and Major Burgess at the latter’s observation post. Fairly warm artillery fire while we were there, directed at Phillips Battery. Major Burgess decided to move his observing station to a spot close to my station in the lines of the 11th Battalion. He has also prepared an emplacement close to his No 3 gun for Brighton Battery gun. Track from 3rd F.A. Bde HQrs being taken along to Head Quarters 3rd Inf Brigade, and steps from our HeadQrs to firing line arranged for. Artillery road around whole \n\nposition commenced today. Major Brown preparing an alternative emplacement for no 4 gun. Our aeroplane gain flew overhead this afternoon and dropped a bomb on the Enemy. \"Ah, there she lays another egg\" is the comment one hears among the Infantry when a bomb is dropped. \n\nSortie in front of \"Quinns post\" tonight. Fun commenced at 10.30 with a heavy rifle fire and plenty of trench mortar bombs. Fighting was continued fairly vigorously all through the night. Have not heard result. Heard today a big mail of 350 bags had arrived and would be unloaded this morning.\n\nTuesday 8th June\n\nAn exceedingly hot day. We shall find the summer fairly trying and the flies an awful nuisance. Enemy has been very quiet today and this evening. No artillery fire at all and practically no rifle fire.\n\nIs he changing his dispositions and massing for a fresh attack or is he feeling he has had enough to go on with and wants a rest? Major Burgess completed his new observing station and my new station is under weigh. Artillery road behind position further advanced today. Artillery promotions out. Capt Lloyd will be very dissatisfied, but everybody else will agree the fair thing has been done. A monitor joined the Destroyers here yesterday, but steamed away again in the evening. I understand we are to have three stationed here.\n\nOur big mail has not yet been delivered. The Authorities are very slow. \n\nWednesday 9th June \n\nLt Evans yesterday posted to 9th battery, vice Crisp, promoted and transferred to 7th Battery. Lt Pybus attached to 3rd B.A.C. Approval given for Lt Urquhart and Morgan to proceed to Alexandria, to relieve Capt Gee and Lt Hodgens who will report here for experience.\n\nLts Morgan and Urquhart leave tonight. Several men reported here this morning from Alexandria for the Brigade. Work continued on new observing station. Should be completed tomorrow. Col Hobbs called at my Headquarters this morning re Benson’s substantive promotion. I think satisfactory arrangements can be made.\n\nArtillery road for No1 Section now about half completed. Still no sign of our big mail. Monitor fired a number of heavy rounds today. Received news of one of our submarines in Sea of Marmora, sinking a Turkish gunboat, Transports and 3 boats carrying ammunition – in all 11 ships. A fairly smart Artillery duel this afternoon. Our 4.5\" Hows and some 18 prs Loosed off at targets we could not see, and for a time the enemy \n\nreplied fairly fiercely. He gave in at last.\n\nThe following is a complete list of 3rd FA Brigade Casualties to June 10th 1915.\n\nHeadquarters\n\nLt Col C. Rosenthal wounded 5.5.15\n\nNo 2087 Corporal A.c.

Drivers was hit with a bullet. His wound is in the abdomen and is serious. This casualty caused me to look up our Brigade list, which I have entered on the previous page. It shows 7 killed and 50 wounded. A fairly heavy percentage out of 350 men, which is all I have ashore. The remainder are at Alexandria attending to Brigade Horses.\n\nThe enemy’s artillery this morning and again this afternoon opened up a smart cannonade, but our guns soon silenced them. Once our shrapnel gets near them they seem disinclined to serve their guns. Otherwise a quiet day.\n\nGeneral Fuller R.A, the senior Artillery officer with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was round the lines today with General Cunliffe Owen. The latter did not do either Colonel Hobbs or Brigade Commanders the common courtesy of informing them they were coming around. As a consequence General Owen, who really knows very little of our work from personal observation (as he never comes near our emplacements) has doubtless received what Commendation General Fuller had to bestow. Very quiet evening. I am now writing in my \"dugout\" at 8.10PM in the twilight and hardly a sound of battle can be heard. The enemy has been very quiet indeed the last three days. A shell today pierced Richards’ observation shield.\n","229":"\n\nTwo very heavy rifle fusillades during the night, possibly enemy attacking. Completed Brigade Forward officers observing station and Telephone recess, and put up necessary notice Boards. Fairly heavy cannonade late this afternoon. Our guns replied and silenced the enemy. Major Burgess did some damage to a group of horsemen and a train of camels Southward. One of the Headquarters staff brought me in an unexploded high explosive Turkish shell. I have the fuse which is rather an interesting one, but the shell I am afraid we shall be unable to empty. It is a similar type of shell to the one that entered my old \"dugout\". We find mails will not reach here till tomorrow evening. The reported big bundles of mails coming ashore proved to be bags of meat. The Artillery roadway is nearing completion, and will be a great boon for all arms of the service, particularly Infantry moving in formed bodies. Capt Jopp returned to duty with me two days ago, and I am now using him exclusively as Forward Observing officer for this Brigade, while my orderly Officer, Lt Richards is temporarily loaned to 7th battery. Mr Forrest is for the present acting as Adjutant.\n\nSaturday 12th June\n\nThe day opened with a lively cannonade from the enemy’s guns, replied to by our own Artillery. The enemy is using percussion shell, and is trying to break down our earthworks and trenches.\n\nShooting commenced before 5AM and continued till 6 AM. We have now taken over our new Brigade and Naval Observing Station, and just as well we moved. At 11 o’clock today a shell burst over the old position and killed two men. Enemy’s Artillery got on to 7th Battery during the evening and our old friend the 6\" Howitzer also spoke, firing 5 rounds. As indicating the enemy’s difficulty in concealing their guns and still being able to bring effective fire to bear, two of his rounds today from \"Gun Ridge\" hit his own crest. Colonel Johnstone left for a week’s rest, Major Bessil Browne taking over from him. A very quiet night.\nGot letters ready for tomorrow’s mail, to each member of the family and one to the old folks and Emma.\n\nSunday 13th June\n\nThis morning at 5AM the \"Bacchante\" and \"Dartmouth\" came off our position and shelled various positions of the enemy till 7AM, when they both went South. Lt Richards on No4 gun of 7th Battery, located the gun behind the forward slope of Contour 400, which has given trouble lately. It was behind the false crest I had previously indicated to him. As soon as the ships saw Richards’ bursts they swept the place right and left with their shell, and I think they must most certainly have knocked out the gun, though from our position we cannot see. Generally it was like the early days of the war here, to hear Men O’ War Loosing off their broadsides. Major Hughes returned to duty this morning also a Sergt Bow of this Battery in addition to the Q.M.S. of 3rd BAC. Generally a quiet day.\n\nIn the evening as usual the Olive Grove Battery opened on us, with our usual reply. Destroyer firing on what we think is a Head Quarters for a Section of Coast Defence. I wish I could be allowed leave to make a night sortie in that direction. I believe it could be successfully carried out. Capt Harris at my Headquarters re visual signalling. Line to D.A. duplicated and laced. Our mail has for some unaccountable reason been sent back to Alexandria – for sorting I understand. Only a few papers came across, and every body is incensed at the delay.\n","230":"\n\nA lively cannonade heralded daylight. Just before\n\n5am the enemy’s guns Loosed off and we expended about 80 rounds before he was quietened. New guns opened up from the centre depression of Gaba Tepe. One of Browne’s 8th Battery men wounded today by shrapnel. Visited D.A. Headquarters this afternoon. Had a long interview with Col Hobbs.\n\nObtained authority to select party of from 20 to 25 men for night sorties in connection with proposed demolition of enemy’s guns. So far he will not consent for me to go, though I think I could be successful. General Owen came in while I was there and we discussed Artillery details generally. Obtained authority for 10 rounds of 6\" How. Ammunition to be expended on Gaba Tepe target if they should open fire tomorrow morning. Navy did a fair amount of shelling, enemy very quiet all the evening and night.\n","231":"\n\nA few shell over us this morning. No damage done. Col Hobbs went round the whole Artillery position with Capt Bean and gave him \"first-hand\" Artillery information. Cameron returned to duty with HeadQrs from Capt Trenchard’s Howitzer Battery. Heard today that Col Legge had been made a General and appointed to the Command of our Division. Personally I am very gratified that an Australian Officer is to be our Commander. I believe he will be here in a few days.\nGenerally a very quiet day.\n\nWednesday 16th June\n\nA few enemy’s shell came in early this morning. Later in the day Major Browne opened fire on a target and in a few minutes the bulk of the Artillery on both sides was engaged. Three shell landed close to my Headquarters coming from a new direction, one bursting within 20 yards. We are accordingly putting up a few more sandbags today for extra protection. During the cannonade Major Hughes had his No 2 gun temporarily disabled. The shield was pierced by a shell, range drum smashed, and sundry other damage done. Luckily the detachment had been withdrawn a few minutes earlier. Another gun was promptly exchanged for the damaged one. Major Hughes has now had 3 guns knocked out since the action commenced. The 3rd Inf Bde sent out a party last night to fill in some enemy trenches and if possible get the infantry digging them.\n\nI have not heard the result.\nHeavy cannonade down South all day. A very quiet night. \n\nAgain very quiet morning and day generally. Benson has been busy on sketch of No1 Section Anzac Position, showing panorama of Enemy’s country. The General says he will have them printed and distributed officially for use. As I write at 7PM the Olive Grove Battery is vigorously shelling the beach. Major Burgess is just getting on to him, so I expect he will soon ease off.\n\nAll our destroyers bolted off Southward about noon today, rather indicating that a Man O’ War or Transport had possible been torpedoed. We have however had no particulars. Flies, flies, everywhere – a dreadful nuisance. Very quiet night. Glorious sunset. Benson proposes making a water colour from my \"Residence\".\n\nFriday 18th June\n\nEnemy fairly quiet. Sketch of No1 Section also sketch of coast handed to Col MacLagan for reproduction. Benson will now probably commence on a similar sketch for No 2 Section and possibly later the New Zealand Section. Got Brigade party together for possible night operations.\n\nDiscussed with R.M.L.I. Officer position for new 6\" How landed yesterday. Road around No 1 Section completed, that from No 2 Section decided yesterday and work will be commenced at once. Lunched with Major Martyn and Engineer Officers. Olive Grove guns opened fire along beach at 10PM tonight, rather unusual. Major Burgess got on to a party of 250 Infantry this morning, with result a heavy casualty list.\n\nCelebrating waterloo Centenary.\n\nSaturday 19th June\n\nMajor Browne went with a party for a \"Joy Ride\" down the coast in a Destroyer while Major Hughes, Richards and myself walked around the New Zealand position. The Country around Suvla Bay and Anafarta looks very fine. Would make ideal Golf links. Plenty of nice shady olive trees, and fields scarlet with poppies. The left flank position is a very difficult one. On the way back a few of the enemy’s shell followed us up, all at a safe distance excepting one, which burst over our head and spattered the beach with bullets about 50x in front of us. During the afternoon a 6\" How from the vicinity of Hill 911 lodged 100 lb shells down the valley close to my position. Many were \"blind\" and I think those which did explode did no damage.\nFor about half an hour at 5 o’clock quite a number of enemy’s shell \n\nof all sizes arrived from all directions. Very quiet night. Heard today that although 150 bags of mails had arrived no artillery mails were included.\n\nWhat has happened to Postal Staff.\n\nSunday 20th June\n\nA very heavy trying day – the worst we have had since landing in Gallipoli. Spent the morning writing Nell and the three boys. Bligh went to Imbros yesterday to get me a few things from the \"Cardiganshire\" including some interesting photographs and should return today.\n\nAn artist, Murray Jones, who is attached to general Birdwood’s staff called this afternoon to see Benson’s sketches. I introduced Benson and sent them off together. General Birdwood and Staff called here about 3.30PM, had a talk about the situation generally and then went on to see Col Ryrie, who is taking over the extreme right flank.\n\nThe General expressed appreciation of sketches which happened to be on my table. From all accounts I gather my Brigade Headquarters are the most up to date in our Army Corps. Every body who calls here congratulates me on the design, but then, I am an architect, and even if our Headquarters are \"dug out\" in the side of a hill, there can still be some semblance of order about their construction. I heard today that we are at last to have some high explosive ammunition for our 18 prs. This will give friend Turk something of a shock. General Sir Ian Hamilton is to inspect this position at an early date. \nUp till now his personal attentions have been directed to Cape Helles end.\nCol Hobbs, Major Hughes, Capt Rogers and myself out of sorts today. Possibly something wrong with our water Supply.\n\nMonday 21st June\n\nDuring last night a terrific fusillade lasted for some time rather as a prearranged scheme to draw enemy’s fire. We hear that last night the French at Helles after expending about 10,000 rounds of Field Artillery Ammunition advanced a mile and despite a Counter attack, this morning held the position gained. General Owen and General Knox came round our position this morning. General Sir Ian Hamilton was to have inspected today but did not arrive. We have had very little Artillery fire today.\n\nMail in at last. I received from Nell dated April 5th and May 2nd, also one from Arthur King dated April 25th. All our letters have apparently not come to hand. The news of our doings has evidently just filtered through to Australia, and casualty returns are beginning to make the Australian people think. Capt Jopp gave me two London Weekly Times, which gave very good details \n\nof our work here and lists of wounded and killed officers. I am sending them on to Nell. Again a glorious sunset. I wish I could paint the colours as we see them.\n\nTuesday 22nd June\n\n\"Fourteenth for tea.\" This is a call I have just heard. 7 AM. I have slept soundly and no enemy’s guns or rifle fire to awaken me this morning.\n\nInspected pit for new Howitzer. It is now complete. Squaring up gun emplacements generally. Major Hughes very unwell. Was out with the Col Hobbs this morning setting out. Artillery road for the Engineers. He looks dreadfully ill and will I am sure collapse altogether unless he takes a change at once. He has been suffering from dysentery for some days. Making arrangements to fit all our Brigade phones and lines underground, to be safe from big shell fire. Aeroplane over a good deal yesterday. Enemy’s plane rose up from Maidos this morning but did not come over our lines. Monitor demolishing enemy’s trenches around Gaba Tepe. Burgess had a premature at no 1 gun. No damage done. Enemy got a shell into a water barge this morning. We thus lose 4 days supplies. Well are however giving plentiful supply. We hear the troops in the South have made a substantial advance and taken many Turkish trenches. Also that it is intended by the enemy to use Gas against us as the Germans have done. All ranks however have neutralising respirators, so brother Turk will get a surprise. Benson away making sketch of No 2 Section Anzac position.\n\nWe have just received for neighbours in our locality the 9th Battery 3rd Inf Bde, about 1000 men. They May be good soldiers, but they are a terribly rough crowd, and their language is lurid and obscene. The latter alone should scare the Turks. Bligh returned from \"Cardiganshire\" at Imbros, bringing with him a nice lot of photos from the Chief Engineer and a box of groceries as a present from the Captain. Both very acceptable. He sent condensed milk, cocoa, coffee, peas, tinned apricots, sauce and some butter, the latter being a luxury. We have had none since April 25th. A piece of cake was thrown in.\n\nWednesday 23rd June\n\nMajor Browne came to see me during the morning and stayed to lunch. He says my Headquarters are a wonderful contrast to those of Col Johnstone. He has made no attempt to do things properly. Brown says Col Johnstone has some grievance and he hears while he is at \n\nAlexandria resting he is endeavouring to get a Light Horse Regiment. I cannot understand a man wanting to leave gunners, but I gather some of his friends are getting promotion over his head and this is not to his liking.\n\nLt Edwards had to go to Hospital ship today – indications of fever. Capt Rogers is far from well and Col Hobbs appears really ill. He was wise enough to stay under cover today and rest, otherwise he will most certainly collapse. Headquarters Telephone staff well dug into face of hill today. Should ensure immunity from shell fire. Enemy’s Artillery opened vigorously during afternoon, our guns responding. Mackworth and Anderson spent some time with me at my Brigade Observation Station. Good news from Cape Helles. Our troops made a substantial advance.\n\nThursday 24th June\n\nAt 7AM the enemy gave us a brisk artillery reception. Burgess and Hughes responded, also the Mountain Battery but took some time to locate and silence guns. Again about 8.30 the enemy opened. One shell caused 9 casualties in 9th Battalion lines, adjoining my Head Quarters, one man being killed. This morning with Col Arnott I examined L. Horse trenches on \"A\" ridge. They are getting gradually nearer Gaba Tepe. Howitzers opened again from Gaba Tepe on shipping. Col Arnott wants to \"Scotch\" Olive Grove guns. I told him I was after that job, so now he wants to take on \"Wine Glass Hill\" guns and us \"Olive Grove\". We shall try to work out a joint scheme for Headquarters approval. Getting telephone exchange into new \"Dugout\". General Legge arrived today to take over our Division. Colonel Johnstone reserved duty with 2nd Brigade after atrip to Alexandria and Major Brown resumed Command of 8th Battery. Lieut Garling temporarily attached to 8th Battery. A Scottish Territorial Howitzer Battery arrived today and is attached to my group. Strange it should have the same number as my old Howitzers; the 5th.\n\nFriday 25th June\n\nInterview with Col Hobbs and Major Stewart (5th How battery) regarding positions for 5\" Howr. Accepted the spot I had been reserving for the Australian Howitzers. Showed Major Stewart round the position. He and his officers had lunch with me. During then afternoon he commenced terracing for his men. Damaged gun of 7th battery having been repaired was put back in position. \n\nBr Macfarlane of 7th Battery badly wounded by machine gun fire. No 4 gun got onto a group of staff and did good work. Showed Colonel Arnott\n\nround our observing stations. General Legge arranging for Australian Howitzers and ammunition to be cabled for immediately. High explosive 18pr Ammunition used here by us for first time. \n\nSaturday 26th June\n\nAssisted Major Stewart during the day. Had road widened, magazines for ammunition and vehicles prepared, and our men hauled his guns into position for him. His men very soft and the hot weather playing up with them. Lively cannonade this evening. Sir Ian Hamilton inspected our Section. I met him at","232":" Battery.\n\nWorked till 10PM assisting Howitzer Battery.\n\nSunday 27th June\n\nAround with Major Stewart all day. Enemy attempted an attack this morning, so decided to register targets with Howitzers, before digging in is commenced. Registered Johnstone's Jolly, Lone Pine, Long Valley, Target C, Wine Glass Hill Guns etc very effectively. Col Hobbs saw one series from","233":" Battery.\n\nGen Legge, Col White and Col Hobbs came to my Headquarters at 10AM and I accompanied them through our section. Gen Legge very affable, spoke of old associations. Came back to my Headquarters about 3 hours later and talked for some time. At last I have persuaded the \"powers that be\" to get our old Howitzers from Australia. I told Gen Legge the shooting with Howitzers today had given me a new lease of life. Capt Jopp temporarily transferred to Mountain Battery vice Toms and Rawson wounded yesterday.\n\nI am just off for a swim – 8.15PM and still daylight.\n\nIn consequence of being so busy today I have not written letters, but will have to be up at 5 or 4.30 to write them tomorrow. Arthur King wrote me re my being wounded. Paper of","234":" from Nell.\n\nGreat excitement this afternoon. A rabbit started out of a bush and in a few minutes over 100 men were chasing it, and hundreds looking on cheering wildly. The Turks must have thought a charge was pending. Bunny dodged them all and got away so there was no stewed rabbit for tea.\n","235":"\n\nGenerally a very busy day. A big attack took place in the south and we here made a demonstration in order to pin the troops here to their ground. We fired about 700 rounds of\n\nArtillery Ammunition in my Section. Some of our troops moved out to feint attack. There were a number of casualties, but how many I do not yet know. The Southern troops made a fine advance and took a new position. General Cunliffe Owen lunched with me. Howitzer Battery registered more targets.\n","236":"\n\nAssisting Howitzer Battery with emplacements and registration of further targets. Generally a quiet day, though at night the Turks attacked on our Left and were badly beaten off. Down South good work has been done, and advanced positions taken.\n","237":"\n\nEarly this morning I went out with Major Stewart to register further targets. Aeroplane Series from Major Burgess’ Battery against Olive Grove at 7.30 AM, afterwards series with Major Browne and Caddy. Major Miles accompanied the Pilot as observer. He had one shot fired at him. Located 2 new batteries behind Achi Baba ridge firing South and reported them. Received message from 8th Division thanking for the information which they stated was very valuable. Unpleasant remarks with Mountain Battery concerning operations on","238":" Major Burgess had another premature, making twelve in all out of 2600 rounds. Two 5\" Howrs set in emplacements. Lines of fire for night work laid out on \"Johnstone's Jolly\" and \"Lone Pine\". Heavy thunderstorm tonight and heavy rifle fire. As large columns of dust were seen during the day north of Achi Baba I thought enemy might be preparing a special attack against us and therefore ordered the Artillery of my section to be in readiness. Lt Glendinning reported from Alexandria.\n","239":"\n\nAfter all a very quiet night. A 4\" gun opened on us today but luckily did no damage. Have been unable to locate it up to the present time. As soon as we do the 5\" How shall have a \"go\" at him. No further Howitzer registration today, Major Stewart being ill.\n\nMajor Ferguson, Mountain Brigade, apologised for his remarks re 28th work.\n\nGen Owen and myself accepted apology. Col Hobbs confidentially informed me that more Howitzers would soon be here, and asked me to look out suitable positions for two Batteries. This I have done. How battery still on their work for digging in. Men are very slow. Wrote to Robert re taking over Australian 5\" Hows and to chief Inspector Woolwich Arsenal, recommending alteration in No 3 Director to admit of vertical angles of 45o being read. War Diary forwarded to Base.\n","240":"\n\nHowitzer Battery registered \"chess Board\" target in morning, and in evening got into new work on Pine Ridge, followed up by two surprise rounds at 10PM, and two rounds from Hughes Battery.\n\nLong interview with Col Hobbs, Col MacLagan, Col Ryrie and Major Burgess, concerning prematures. Decided that when warning is given men must take cover. Col Hobbs inspected sites I had selected for Howr Batteries and approved same. Enemy’s shell got into Hughes No 1 gun pit this afternoon, killing one man and wounding another. Major Burgess had a man wounded with rifle bullet. Major Hughes very sick. He must get away for a month.\n","241":"\n\nA fair amount of Artillery fire today. The enemy’s 4\" gun from Olive Grove fired several rounds, one of which burst close to Hughes Battery, killing one man and wounding another. Heard from Col Hobbs that we were to get 4.7\" guns on this flank. I have been urging this for some time and am pleased to see approval at last given. We shall be able to take on long range guns of enemy. Selected site for them. Howitzers again shooting on \"Chessboard\". Heavy Artillery fire down South. Activity on the part of enemy manifest on Hill 600 – getting ready for their retreat I expect. Received letter from Nell dated May","242":" with photos of Chris and Shirley, one Daily Telegraph of 8th May, 5 British Australasians from A.T.

Interview with Major Brown and Burgess re appointment of officers. Major Hughes left for Hospital ship, very thankful I am that I have good health. \n","243":"\n\nA terrific artillery cannonade opened this morning at 4AM. I was awakened by shrapnel bullets and fragments of shell falling at the entrance to my dugout. Very little damage was done generally, but one shell burst over 8th Battery, killing a Corporal and wounding three other men. We located two of the enemy’s guns near Gaba Tepe and firing 8 rounds with the 5\" Howitzer registered them. Cannonade ceased about 7 AM.\n\na little later 8 rounds of 11\" shell came over from the direction of Maidos and landed near the Beach and Army Corps Headquarters. As Fort 24 on the other side of the Dardanelles (the Narrows) has three 11\" guns mounted we conclude it came from that Fort. A strange incident happened today which May later be explained. All our trawlers and mine sweepers had made a circle round our shipping and had possible laid mines. At about 4.30 PM a huge column of water was lifted up, resembling the effect of a mine explosion, then something moved rapidly close under the surface of the water, getting gradually slower and then stopped, apparently sinking. For some time smoke and what appeared to be air bubbles kept rising to the surface. I am of opinion a Submarine has struck a mine and foundered. A huge column of smoke was seen south at 6.18AM in the enemy’s country. Looked like an Ammunition dump being blown up.\n","244":"\n\nAn exceedingly quiet day. Emplacement for 4.7\" gun commenced and 6\" Howitzer moved to a new position on Right Flank. Conference with Col Hobbs and Col Johnstone re use of artillery in case of attack by enemy if using asphixiating gas bombs. Decided to leave matter in hands of Brigade Commanders to act as they think best. A little shelling of shipping late this afternoon. Arranged with Engineers re construction of 4.7\" roadway.

He informed me 5\" Howrs from Australia were approved. Col Christian’s Brigade is to be attached to the three new Infantry Brigades arrived in Egypt from Australia and with a Howr battery this will be their total artillery for the present. He told me scheme for us was to advance, establish ourselves across the neck from Gaba Tepe to Maidos, and then force the Turks on the Southern end to either attack us or surrender. Our submarines are effectively preventing the enemy using the town of Gallipoli, and stores and men have to be ferried over at Chanak.\n\nGenerally a quiet day as far as the enemy was concerned. \n\nThursday 8th July\n\nAround all stations with Col Hobbs. Gen Legge met us at 4\"7 emplacement. Matter of drugs brought before the General. The 5 How. Battery bombarded \"Johnstone's Jolly\" during the evening, many shell failing to detonate. N.Z.

This bomb partially buried itself in the ground and did not detonate. I secured it, and forwarded it to \n\nDivisional Headquarters, after removing the fuse which is most interesting. Party of 26 from 3rd FAB left at daylight for Imbros for a few days rest. The 5\" Howr put some shell into Valley of Despair during the afternoon.\n\nWe evidently made things uncomfortable for all their guns opened on us, doing however no damage. Late in the evening a chance shell fell into No 1 Pit 8th Battery, killing two men and wounding another. Another shell fell into 7th Battery no 4 gun pit, damaging a wheel but causing no casualties.

H.M.S. \"Humber\" took on guns at Olive Grove but did little good. 5\" Howr fired an aeroplane series during afternoon. Handed cigars to Col Arnott. Smart Artillery duel during evening. A few Infantry casualties just above my Headquarters. Glad to learn Col Coxen is to command Heavy Brigade from Australia.\n\nTuesday 20th July\n\nAt 5AM made a thorough reconnaissance of country in vicinity of Tasmania Post with a view to finding possible good gun position. At 11.30 AM took Colonel Hobbs round same position and told him I wished to make a tunnel through Bolton Hill to give access to Poppy Valley for future Artillery advance. He thought the scheme good and obtained the G.O.C.’s sanction to having it carried out. Discussed names of men worthy of notice in Orders with Col Hobbs and specially recommended 3 from 7th Battery and 3 from 8th Battery. Left my Headquarters about 8.30 PM to visit Colonel Hobbs at Headquarters. Called at","254":" Field Ambulance and just when leaving there was hit by a rifle bullet. It entered my left leg beside the knee and came out behind the knee. Strangely enough, bone, tendon and Artery were all missed.

Our new Batteries registering. Enemy’s 5\" How again fired a few rounds also some of his field guns but nothing serious. Aeroplane series during afternoon. Aeroplane had about 50 shells and plenty of machine gun fire directed at it, but without doing any damage. New 5\" Howr late in evening registered Bastion and works on Pine Ridge. It was expected that attack might develop tonight or tomorrow being Turkish Constitution day, and in consequence all necessary preparations\n\nhave been made by us, including extra supply of ammunition and Respirators and gas helmets. Rest party returned. Lieut Richards sent to Hospital.\n\nFriday 23rd July\n\nNo attack developed during the night. Our Howitzers have kept up a slow rate of fire during the night, dropping shells into various valleys where the enemy is known to Bivouac. The detonation of these 50lb Lyddite shell at irregular points and intervals must have a very demoralising effect of Turkish troops. It is rumoured they are being, or have been reinforced by 100,000 men of sorts and a supply of shell. I think our fellows are quite equal to the task of wiping them out. Howitzers doing further registration. Col Hobbs called at my Headquarters. Told me many changes would be made during coming week. Interviewed Major Clougston re roadway through or over Bolton Hill. He is to report best scheme to me. Attack expected tonight. Received two letters from Alvord, one from Chris, one from A.T. Sharp, one from Charley and one from R.I.B.A. Two more casualties in B.A.C. today.\n\nSaturday 24th July\n\nVery quiet night. Anticipated Turkish attack did not eventuate.

Olive Grove field guns and 4\".2 opened very early this morning along beach, but Burgess silenced them with 4 rounds. Received one letter from Alvord, one from father dated June 7th, Nell June 14th, and Charley June 30th. Still anchored to hut. Very galling.\n\nSunday 25th July\n\nDetailed Fitter Sergt Ellis for duty at heavy battery. Made Price acting Sergt Fitter of 7th Battery. Wrote Nell, father, Charley, Alvord, Chris, A.T. Sharp and J. Halford. Got some seeds today of broom, very beautiful yellow flowers, and very fragrant. I also got some Juniper seeds, and other kinds, the names of which I do not know. Enemy’s Artillery trying to get Burgess’ upper guns this afternoon. They got very close, but did no damage. Another aeroplane series this evening. Jopp will be getting quite an expert on Aeroplane spotting. No further indications of expected attack.\n\nMonday 26th July\n\nToday the 4\".7 made its debut amid much cheering from the Infantry. It registered three targets. Burgess got into a heap of\n\nof transport, animals, vehicles and personnel at 7150x. Quite unexpected as far as the enemy was concerned. Commencement of further changes. General Legge with a number of officers, NCOs and men, yesterday left for Egypt to take up duty with the new Division. Major Anderson also left for Egypt on Special duty. Harris acting as BM, and Vowles as Staff Captain. Nicholson leaves us for General Staff, 2nd Division. Fairly warm fire opened from Olive Grove during the evening. Our old friend the 6\" Howr also fired about 4 rounds, but Burgess silenced him. Col Hobbs told me of his recommendations concerning Honours and rewards. His own promotion to Brigadier General is under weigh and will soon be an accomplished fact. Another man killed today, belonging to 8th Battery also two men wounded. They were on the beach. Had a short roam around today with the aid of a stick. Capt Marks very unwell and sent to Hospital. Capt Dangerfield A.M.C. taking his place. Wrote in to OCDA. concerning work done by Marks, for the information of the A.D.M.S.\n\nTuesday 27th July\n\nAccording to the Greek Consul at Constantinople the Turks were expected to attack us on or before this date. The day has however passed and excepting for the usual shelling there has been nothing special to note. The Anafarta gun made things rather warmer at A.C.H Qrs and in consequence our Aus Div HQrs had to move to a more sheltered spot.\n\nHad a long letter from Jopp giving particulars of his Aerial reconnaissance. Col Hobbs phoned me his recommendations concerning officers for meritorious Services. I find my own name is included. Mountain battery during night shelled works in front of Tasmania Post.\n\nWednesday 28th July\n\nThe 4th Battery of the Lowland Brigade arrived during last night. I supplied 8 horse team and 20 men to assist in disembarkation and bringing guns to position. Lieut Onslow ADC to General Birdwood killed by shell during night. General Cunliffe Owen, Col Hobbs and Col Shepherd (O.C. Lowland Brigade) present at my Headquarters. Duties of Lowland Brigade defined and allotted. Olive Grove 6\" Howr.

Handed over working parties to Major Clougstone for Artillery road, from Shell green to valley between Bolton Hill and Tasmania Post. Electric bulbs for torch received from England, also boots from Callaghan & Son. Sydney. Colonel Hobbs promoted Brigadier General. I extended him my Brigade’s hearty congratulations. Watched Howr shoot at 5 P.M. on Echelon Trenches. Only five rounds fired which did not register target. Waste of ammunition unless a good series authorised.\n\nDiscussed situation with Gen MacLagan. Hostile aeroplane overhead about 7 o’clock. Appeared to volplane down to earth East of Gun Ridge. Our aeroplane up at same time, but as she is not armed she discreetly kept out of the way. Miles gave enemy first taste of his long range gun today against Infantry drilling on Kilid Bahr plateau. More reinforcements arrived for Brigade. \n","258":"\n\nAn Aeroplane over at 6AM.

We were very successful. Olive Grove and Wine Glass Batteries put up a heavy fire but it was generally badly aimed and 9th Battery, helped by Lowland 5\" Howrs kept them under. I watched the operations from my observing station. Very pretty sight and an awful din. Infantry took trench and commenced to reconstruct it. I went to bed at 1 AM.\n\nSunday 1st August\n\nEnemy’s artillery opened a brisk fire at 4.15AM. particularly on trench taken by our Infantry. The 9th and 5\" Batteries soon got on to them and eventually silenced them. New work being strengthened. Total casualties in Infantry 75 wounded and 20 killed, while Light Horse lost Col Harris killed. Many dead Turks could be seen in front of trenches, and generally we feel they had a very bad time.

Plentiful supply of ammunition generally coming forward now. All guns being again manned tonight in case enemy should counter attack on trenches captured by us. Enemy dropping some big high explosive shell in Victoria Gully, evidently searching for Howitzers. So far they have done no damage, and from our point of view we shall be pleased to se them put plenty of shell in the same place.

General bombardment of enemy’s position on Johnstones Jolly and Lone Pine carried out at intervals during day. During arrival of troops last night Olive Grove commenced a brisk shelling of Anzac Cove, but 9th Battery and 5th How Battery kept on to them all night and effectually kept their fire under.\n\nUnderwent secondary inoculation against Cholera. General Hobbs at my Headquarters during afternoon. Very dissatisfied with condition of gun emplacement 5th How Battery. Divisional Orders (Secret) issued giving details of attack on August 6th. Hostile aeroplane again overhead. Engaged by 9th Battery. General Hobbs offered appointment as Orderly Officer to Gen Cunliffe Owen to Lt Garling, Lieut Glendinning and Lieut Pybus. All expressed their desire to remain with guns. Gen Hobbs had to detail Lt Pybus temporarily to the position. Enemy’s artillery quiet. \n","263":"\n\nEnemy’s artillery very quiet until 4 o’clock this afternoon when Olive Grove opened briskly. Interview with Gen Hobbs and Brigade Commanders at 8th Battery at 12 noon. General Bombardment again carried out, more ammunition being used than was allotted. More men arrived last night (Kitchener Army) also more men for 3rd F.A. Brigade. Sent a message to Divisional Head Quarters that \"North Lancashires\" had selected a bad spot for Bivouac on the Southern slopes of MaCay’s Ridge just under Burgess 3 & 4 guns. They will surely get Olive Grove, H.E, and shrapnel shell directed at these guns. Major Burgess warned them personally. At 9 AM this morning had O.C.s to my Head Quarters and went through Operation Orders with them. Received orders from 3rd Infantry Brigade at 5.15PM, and issued my own orders for tomorrows work at 7 PM. Had a little extra cover put over my \"Dugout\" in the shape of sandbags. Telephone Communication with new DA position established. Orderlies arranged for tomorrow for DA, Bde Hqs and Batteries in case of break down of Telephone lines. Gunner killed at 7th Battery. \n","264":"\n\nEnemy did not wait for us to attack him today but commenced on us at daylight. I was awakened by heavy rifle fire and found the enemy was attacking Tasmania Post and Leanes Trench. \n\nBy dint of a very free use of powerful bombs the enemy got possession of a part of Leanes Trench, but was promptly turned out with the bayonet. I think we had a good many casualties but we also know the Turks suffered heavily. Fire was kept up all the morning. At 10 o’clock I interviewed General Hobbs at 8th battery. Arrangements completed for cooperation with Gen. Ryrie’s Operations for tonight. Visited 7th Battery and carefully went through all orders with battery Commander. At 4.30 PM intense bombardment of Lone Pine was commenced. Ground fairly trembled with Lyddite\n\ndetonations from Howitzer shell. Navy also cooperated. Our old friend , H.M.S Bacchante again assisting. 1st Brigade attacked at 5.30 and succeeded in securing Lone Pine, the enemy retreating. Plenty of Shrapnel shell on Tasmania Post and 7th Battery. Three Casualties in BAC at 7th Battery, and Sergt Major Handford killed. Enemy reinforcing right flank to extent of about 1000 to 1500 men. Fully expect they will heavily counter attack tonight. Several Casualties in 5th Lowland Battery in front of my Head Quarters, including one of their officers. Many casualties among new English (Kitchener Army) arrivals in Victoria Gully. I understand these troops have at last been moved. Received letters from Olding and Selwen re transfer to 3rd F.A. bde.\n\nSaturday 7th August\n\nHeavy shelling by Navy and our guns during night. I have not yet heard if our operations were successful against German Officers Trench, but on Lone Pine our position is good. At daybreak Suvla Bay and vicinity presented a fine sight, innumerable craft of all kinds moving about, Men o War, Transports, trawlers etc carrying out landing of troops. The Turks must have received a terrible surprise when day dawned. It reminded me of our first day at Gallipoli. The casualties in this show must of necessity be very great. Heard that Turks had reinforced the Right Flank by about 1500 men towards dusk last night. We shall have to keep a sharp look out against Counter attack. A pretty incident at 6AM. \n\nA German Aeroplane flew overhead, and presently one of our biplanes gave chase, manoeuvring for position. The Taube had the better speed and was able to get away. He certainly wasted no time about his departure. The Captive balloon is up watching and reporting effect of Navy shooting. At 6.30AM seven hospital ships were lying off Anzac and Suvla.\n\nA shell landed 2 yards in front of my dugout doorway during the night but luckily did no damage. Lent Sergt and 20 men to Col Shepherd Lowland Brigade at 6.30 AM for transport of Ammunition.\n\nOur troops now entrenched in Lone Pine. 7th and 9th Batteries did excellent work, the former against Infantry targets and the latter doing Counter Battery work. Very interesting to watch landing and movement of Troops at Suvla. An absolute picnic as compared to our first landing. They are pushing well forward, also New Zealand and Australian Division; and we hope soon to have Hill 971. An enemy battery got on to No 4 gun 7th Battery about 7.30 PM and put in 15 H.E. shell. Parapets were smashed to pieces, but neither personnel nor gun suffered damage. This gun kept up fire all night against Snipers Ridge, Weir Ridge and \n\nWanliss Valley. Made a reconnaissance during the evening with the object of selecting new position near Chatham Post for No1 gun 7th Battery. No Success. Will try again during the morning. General MacLagan and General Ryrie expressed admiration of the work done by 7th and 9th batteries. Lieut Evans slightly wounded. I understand two Divisions landed at Suvla.\n\nSunday 8th August\n\nVery heavy bombardment by our guns this morning of position in front of Hill 971. Howitzer Shells were passing my HeadQrs like Express Trains, and the noise generally was terrific. At 4.15 AM our NZ & A division together with new troops attacked along line 161-971. The rifle and machine gun fire together with our guns and guns of the navy made the place an inferno. Our flank is the pivot so matters are comparatively quiet here. 7th Battery again doing good work against Turks in the open. 9th Battery engaged silencing Wine Glass and Olive Grove. Selected new site for No1 Gun 7th Battery and got party to work on it. Informed Gen Hobbs accordingly. Major Anderson returned to duty today, just in time to join in the chorus. Enemy’s Artillery fire on this flank much reduced. Heard that 200 bags of Australian mails had gone down with a trawler. Also heard that we had captured 1500 Turks. Sad burial parties at work. Very many killed on both sides.\n\nGot the No1 Gun 7th Battery into new position and reported to general Hobbs at 8AM that it was ready for action. Mr Forrest very ill. Had to be sent to Hospital Ship. 7th Battery put in a lot of shrapnel during the night. Our forces making good progress.\n\nMonday 9th August\n\nWorked up till 2 AM this morning with detachment for No1 gun, 7th Battery. We got the new emplacement bagged up on the exposed side; the balance of the work being carried out today by gun detachment. B.A.C. party making the approaches and communication trenches. Hope to do good work with this gun. Extra men reported from Alexandria for this Brigade. Very glad to see a\/Br Mitchell, our Brigade Clerk. In Mr Forrest’s absence he will be a very great help. Could not write a decent letter home this week. Work here much too strenuous to admit of any time for oneself.\n\nI have had 3 hours sleep in the last 3 nights. Terrific volume of shell over us since early morning. Before lunch the 7th Battery had over 600 shell landed into its position smashing down gun emplacements. Strange to say our only casualties were 1 man killed, 1 man wounded and Lt Ross wounded. His work has been most meritorious throughout and I am putting in a special report and recommending him for the Military Cross. \n\nThe work done by the 7th Battery during the last 36 hours has been absolutely splendid. Enemy’s attack on Lone Pine this morning very vigorous. We estimate the 7th Battery accounted for over 500 Turks.\n\nMy forward officer in new trenches (Mr Turner) is doing good work. Quiet afternoon. Work on new gun emplacement continued and roadway being improved. Inspected 7th Battery during evening. Found parapet and gun emplacements demolished, 5 enemy’s guns having concentrated on them during the day. They were all rebuilt during the night. Worked at new gun emplacement till midnight. Received two letters from Nell dated 28th and 29th June: also one from Father and two from A.King. \n\nTuesday 10th August\n\nA very quiet night. Very heavy fire early this morning. Our Left Flank heavily engaged. 2nd Artillery Brigade did great execution among massed enemy. Gen Hobbs informed me we captured 1000 rounds of 75M Ammunition. Capt Waite carried out two series in conjunction with Lieut Turner, just in front of new position Lone Pine and in gullies Northward. General Hobbs at 9th and 7th Batteries. Conveyed General Birdwood’s thanks and his own to all ranks and to myself personally. Generally very quiet on Right Flank during day. Enemy has evidently all he can do on the left. Assisting N.Z. Artillery with horses. Had four wounded yesterday moving their guns on left Flank. Aeroplane series for Miles this afternoon against Boghali. While this series was in progress a hostile Taube came over but was promptly chased and forced to the ground by our machine. I think my Adjutant was up spotting. I shall be pleased to hear his version. Laid down platform for No1 Gun 7th Battery. Emplacement now practically completed. Sent in full report of previous 3 days operation. Recommended Capt Waite for the Military Cross.\n\nWednesday 11th August\n\nA very quiet night. Got a very acceptable sleep. Had a look at our newly captured trenches on Lone Pine. Notwithstanding the fact that our men have been cleaning up and rebuilding since 6th August the place is still in ruins and still gives an excellent conception of the damage caused by the bombardment on 6th August. The place is full of dead Turks. We have had large parties on day and night extricating bodies from damaged trenches and burying them, but there are still hundreds to get out. The smell is pestilential. My Head Qrs are distant about 750x and life is hardly bearable at that distance. It will take \n\nsome days yet before these trenches can be placed in a Sanitary Condition. Visited Col Austin at Ordnance re extra Telephone switch boards. Badly needed. Our relieving medical officer was yesterday so ill that he was ordered off to Hospital and Capt Tozer AMC took his place. During the afternoon a high explosive shell burst in No 2 gun pit 7th Battery, wounding four men, two severely. Our casualties still go on mounting up. I have just heard that one of our gunners on loan to the Indian Mountain Battery was also wounded yesterday. Battle on the left still being vigorously pressed on.\n\nFrom this extreme flank we can see nothing of the movement and get very little information. In any case we have our work cut out in our own zone. Received cable from Nell from Sydney dated 31.7.15\n\nThursday 12th August\n\nA beautiful morning, heralded in by a Turkish gun trying to \"wing\" our captive Balloon used for observation purposes. Unfortunately for him the balloon is well out of range and he has already wasted about 30 rounds. Weather is gradually improving. The extreme heat of the day is gradually being reduced and the nights too are getting much cooler. No one will complain at the improvement. Enemy very quiet on this flank during the night, but cannot speak for the left. 7th Battery doing useful work on Contour 400 dropping shell within 3 yards of our own trenches in enfilade, destroying overhead cover and giving our bomb throwers a chance. S.M. Scarrot reported to me for duty as R.S.M. he is to take up work and Residence here at 9AM tomorrow. General Hobbs at my Head quarters. Informed me matters were ina satisfactory condition on Left Flank. Secured Turkish bayonet – hope rifle will follow tomorrow.\n\nMajor Su Vincent Welch 1st Field Ambulance presented me with the bullet which pierced my leg. He found it the morning after I was hit. Wrote Col Buckley London re switch boards. Stench from Lone Pine abominable. No1 6\" Howr to be moved to new position so as to get more range.\n\nAppended is casualty list from July 15th to August 11th 1915.\n\nHeadquarters\n\n \t\tLt Col Charles Rosenthal O.C.

Gained much valuable information concerning country north and south. Instructed Major Burgess and Capt Waite to make a similar inspection during the day. General Hobbs himself has not been through the position. Stench from dead bodies still dreadful though conditions are much improved. Enemy shelled the position very freely during the afternoon. S.M. Scarrot commenced duties as R.S.M. Gen Hobbs visited 7th Battery with me. During the afternoon a message came through that enemy was massing for attack on Lone Pine. Capt Waite located a number in trenches with fixed bayonets, put in a few H.E. shell and then followed them up with shrapnel. The 7th battery guns are splendidly\n\nplaced for dealing with Lone Pine hill. The General of the 1st Aus Div sent to Capt Waite through General Hobbs a special message of thanks. This afternoon a flotilla of 5 planes came overhead making a very pretty sight.\n\nDuring evening No 1 6\" How was moved to a new position off Artillery Road near BROWN’S DIP. General Walker very anxious about Lone Pine. He anticipates an attack during the night. All our guns ready. About 8.30 a heavy rifle fire opened, but only lasted a few minutes. I think the Turks imagined we were about to attack them.\n\nSaturday 14th August\n\nQuiet night. 7th Battery fired a few rounds in front of Lone Pine position. General Birdwood with his ADC lord Anglesey spent some time at my Headquarters. He specially thanked my Brigade and myself for the work they have done. Expect a big move in the next three days. Established two forward Observation Posts in Lone Pine works with Lt Turner in charge, and 6 trained observers with specially long Periscopes. Enemy shelled this position heavily during afternoon but did no damage and caused no casualties. Heard today that casualties of our Army Corps and the 13th Division working with us is over 12000. I do not yet know actual number of killed and wounded Australians. These casualties are for the last 8 days. Re establishing all my telephone lines on permanent poles, so that spare wires and field poles May be ready for forward observing lines at any moment. Wrote to Nell, Charley, Alvord, Chris, Arthur King and the old folks. Received Argus and Australasian from Nell, also cigarettes from Lady Robinson London, for Queensland troops. Secured a Turkish rifle and bayonet which I hope to take home as a curio. Hospital ships a beautiful sight tonight. There are 5 of them and they have a distinguishing band of green electric lamps in the centre on Port and Starboard sides. Pybus doing well as A.D.C. to general Cunliffe Owen. Today we terminate our 16th week at Gallipoli. I wonder how much longer.\n\nSunday 15th August\n\nToday we commence our 17th week in Gallipoli. Gen Hobbs consulted me today regarding employment of 3Pr naval guns which are expected shortly. He agreed with my suggestion that they should be grouped with 18pr Batteries in pairs under Battery Commanders. If we can succeed in getting the required number they will be of great value. Getting our new telephone lines and permanent poles established. Good progress made. Big mail in. No letters from home, only two papers \n\nfrom Nell. Miss Cowlishaw wrote me on May 21st. letter has been chasing me round and only reached here yesterday. Generally had a quiet day though the enemy shelled our Lone Pine position consistently for an hour, one man only being killed. We discovered a nice new gun emplacement yesterday, so Burgess let off a few rounds of H.E. shell and completely demolished it. Our H.E. is coming forward gradually and is a great adjunct to our usual ammunition. Col White called in to congratulate me on the Artillery work of this flank.\n\nMonday 16th August\n\nSpent the morning in reconnoitring Lone Pine position. Great possibilities for bringing 18pr guns into suitable positions for an advance. Mentioned the matter to general Hobbs on the phone. We will inspect tomorrow again. He called at my Headquarters while I was absent. Wrote to major Warren NSW asking him to send my two Ericsson telephones and two helmet cases. Our horses moved more 18pr guns to Left flank for New Zealanders during evening. Major Browne building new gun emplacements near Major Burgess’ Headquarters. Olive Grove and Wine Glass very active yesterday. The latter shelled our Lone Pine position and we could not locate guns. Consequently we opened with 7th Battery on their trenches. This very soon had the effect of forcing the enemy to switch on to our guns. He fired 52 rounds in 30 minutes but did no damage. Brigade telephone lines nearly finished, all on permanent poles and all air live. A most efficient service.\n\nLast night very quiet. All along the line preparing for another big move. Brother Turk is not getting much rest or peace. Sunset tonight absolutely marvellous. The shipping at Suvla Bay has now assumed big proportions and the Bay is boomed against submarines. Then there are numbers of destroyers, 3 Monitors, trawlers, 5 Hospital ships and plenty of small launches.\n\nTuesday 17th August\n\nWith General Hobbs at Lone Pine looking at depression N.W. of Snipers Ridge and considering possibility of getting guns out that way when we have to advance. I am to get a report from Engineers as to how long it would take to make necessary approach – Gen Hobbs inspected 7th Battery – recommended that SSM Scarrot be appointed R.S.M., and made Warrant Officer to date 12th inst, also asked re acting Adjutant.\n\nOlive Grove very persistent this afternoon. Major Burgess fired about 100 rounds before it was silenced. Am adopting the scheme of shelling enemy’s trenches when their Artillery opens on us and it generally has the effect of\n\nsilencing them, their troops evidently not relishing being shelled in trenches and doubtless they ask for their own Artillery to cease fire. I shall try the experiment concerning Olive Grove at first opportunity. Major Roberts, 11th Inf Battn brought me in the remains of a bomb sent over his position last night. It furnishes me with another neat little percussion fuze for my collection and a drawn brass cylinder which will make a splendid gong. Lt Turner also brought me an unexploded specimen of 75M shell. I drew the charge and burnt it off. I now only want a 14pr HE, a 14pr Fuze and the Small Hotchkiss shell to complete a very nice selection. Doubtless before this show is finished if I am lucky enough to get through safely I May be able to secure all I want. Understand progress on Left Flank is satisfactory.\n\nWednesday 18th August\n\nWith Major Martyn, Engineers, selecting positions from which to make outward gun roadway to Lone Pine for possible advance on South Eastern front for 8th and 9th Batteries. On my return to Headquarters I found a 5\" shrapnel had burst on percussion at the entrance to my \"dugout\", and had smashed things up generally, though fortunately the burst had been outward from the entrance and not inward.\n\nArranged with Col Robertson for certain bays of support trench in front of No 1 gun 7th Battery to have parapet and parados lowered. Trench being filled in at 7th battery to give better protection to no 4 gun. Enemy’s artillery very quiet. 7th battery fired a few rounds at Lone Pine works, and 9th Battery against Olive Grove. Received interesting letter from Capt Jopp, telling me of four encounters he has had with the enemy’s Taubes.\n\nHeadquarters of our Aerodrome now at Imbros. 6th Battery second Brigade arriving tonight, and New Zealand battery from Cape Helles arrived during the day. Our troops on left flank doing well but cannot get much information about the British troops cooperating.\n\nGen DeLisle in Command of Army corps operating from Suvla Bay.\n\nThursday 19th August\n\nMr Forrest returned from sick leave. Gave me a good deal of information concerning Imbros and Hospitals at Mudros. Told me of the torpedoing of the \"Royal Edward\" carrying about 1000 details troops, only 300 of whom were saved. Another ship full of ammunition had passed the same point about 3 hours before (about 200 miles from LEMNOS. The Austrian Submarine was evidently waiting for the ammunition ship. Col Fischer’s Hospital at Mudros has been erected, but the ship with all his\n\nstores has gone astray and he has had to carry on with equipment kindly lent by the Navy. A large condensing plant has now been erected at Mudros. From Chaplains reports to hand I see Capt Johnstone has been invalided to Australia permanently incapacitated. He came ashore at the Dardenelles (not on duty) and was hit while on the beach. Lt Sandy also very low from blood poisoning. Capt Marks was at Malta and returned here today. He had great difficulty in securing his return. Gens Walker and Hobbs at No 1 gun 7th battery. Very gratified with work of 7th battery on Lone Pine and expressed the wish that N. Zealand 18pr Battery should do equally good work on their side. Watched 7th Battery shooting, enemy also dropping shells into Lone Pine position and 7th Battery. One man killed by fragments of HE at Battery. Have just heard that a trawler with some thousands of rounds Artillery ammunition sank off Suvla last night. From enemy’s captured 75m Gun position we learn that their emplacements are under growing trees with heavy timber overhead cover and 6 feet of earth. I understand medical services have been instructed to provide for a campaign here lasting until November. Sent in note for pay required by Brigade in the first week of September. Hear definitely that 200 mail bags went down about 10 days ago in a barge, 160 being Artillery mails. Our luck is out. \n\nFriday 20th August\n\nVery quiet day. Spent the morning at 7th Battery. Watched Waite engaging works on Lone Pine. HE shell very effective. Lowland Howitzer Brigade moving from our section to Left Flank. Lt Turner brought me a 4\".2 shell from Lone Pine; the head of which has been adapted to take ordinary field gun ammunition fuze. Evidently the Turks are short of the correct fuses for theses shell. Several that have come over lately have failed to explode. \n\nWrote A.T. Sharp asking if he could get me two Livingstone medical chests. A\/Sergt Miller sent off to Hospital yesterday. We shall miss him very much in connection with our telephones and lines.\n\nSaturday 21st August\n\nAnother casualty list at 7th Battery this morning. A H.E. shell struck side of gun itself and bursting wounded 4 men out of the detachment of 5, two dangerously. Gun itself has been badly dented and is permanently out of action. Arranged about overhead cover for 7th battery guns, and gave instructions for old casemate to be dismantled and timber to be secured. Hope to make cover that will be proof against H.E. shell. A big movement commenced on the left this \n\nafternoon, the objective being W. Hills near Chocolate Hills. A heavy Artillery bombardment commenced at 2.30PM and continued till 3.30PM, then for the rest of the afternoon and evening the heavy roll of musketry could be heard. We saw troops here withdrawing from Pine Ridge, evidently to reinforce the Left. This zone very quiet all day. Completing new Dugout at Headquarters for Adjutant and Orderly officer. Lowland batteries have now left us. Their camp was left in a filthy condition and ammunition lying in all directions. However they are very short handed through sickness, and have had no reinforcements. Lt Hogue LH, asked me if when a suitable time offered I would give him particulars of the work of Artillery here for a book he is to publish. I agreed. We complete tonight our 18th week here. I inspected Leane's Trench and Tasmania Post. Excellent trenches have been made in each position. \n\nSunday 22nd August\n\nWhen I looked out at 5.45 this morning, I saw 7 Hospital ships at anchor. Evidently the casualties in connection with yesterday’s operations have been very heavy. We received an official message re position on Left Flank, but it is not very clear, and certainly does not indicate a substantial advance. Evidently part of the Infantry of our 2nd Australian Division is now employed in these operations. Arranged with Col Robertson to close and fill up part of a communicating trench adjoining No1 gun 7th Battery, to enable the detachment to erect a solid protecting wall against Wine Glass and Olive Grove. Also inspected 9th Battalion lines in \"Wheat Field\". A great deal of work has been done and trenches are scrupulously clean. Their new firing line will be ready in a few days. The 75M Guns from Gun Ridge fairly active. No damage done to us, but three men killed in Lone Pine. 7th Battery carried out an interesting demolition of enemy’s bomb proof positions and protected trenches at S.E. corner of our position on Lone Pine. New gun placed in action at","268":" Battery to replace one damaged yesterday. In order to test enemy’s strength on this flank a ruse was carried into effect this afternoon and evening. Howitzers fired a number of rounds, one at lEast of which fell among our own trenches, and at night rifle fire etc was \"let Loose\" to draw the enemy. He holds the flank lightly now, his chief aim being doubtless to stop our advance on the left. Wrote Nell only this week.\n","269":"\n\nReceived letters from Nell and Alvord dated July","270":"\n\nfrom North Sydney. At Lone Pine with general Hobbs and Col Johnstone. Instructed to \"go slow\" with ammunition, supply being temporarily short. Sergt Wallis and Corporal hare promoted to Commissioned rank. General asked for further names. Purpose commencing a class for their benefit at Brigade Headquarters. Mr Stamps completed repairs of gun for 7th battery. Two 6pr (Japanese) landed. General Hobbs ordered one to be placed in Gun lane near Lone Pine and the Second one at 7th Battery. One is being set up temporarily for trial. A 75 M shell landed into Lone Pine Telephone Station during afternoon, slightly wounding one Telephonist and the shock knocking the other one out temporarily. Very quiet day and night. Strong land breeze blowing, making plenty of dust fly and generally causing much discomfort. Temperature appreciably lowering.

General Birdwood and Hobbs called to see me during day and insisted on my going to Hospital Ship. Removed to clearing Hospital at 5 PM. Had to wait till 9PM to get on to Barge, reached ship about 9.30. Put to bed and fell into a semi conscious condition. Hospital Ship was the \"Formosa\" and Gen Hobbs also travelled by her to Alexandria, he having been taken ill the day after me, and reached the ship before she cleared Gallipoli. I remember him speaking once to me otherwise my mind is a blank. On reaching Alexandria I was removed to a Military Hospital practically in the town, the name or number of which I cannot remember, and after 24 hours there I was taken by Motor Ambulance to No17 General Hospital at Victoria, a suburb some miles out of Alexandria. Again relapsed into unconsciousness and remember nothing for some days. The doctors informed me that for some four days they Despaired of pulling me through, but eventually I \"turned the corner\", due they think primarily to my having been inoculated previously.\n\ngeneral Hobbs came to see me during this period just prior to his return to Gallipoli.

Ward suddenly informed by Doctor that we had to embark on \"Andania\" for England on","293":" Reached boat at 10.30 AM on that day for motor ambulance and left Alexandria at 5.45PM. Thus closes my enteric Chapter. I don’t want another.\n","294":"\n\nVery beautiful day. Found Major Vernon on Board he being the only officer I knew, excepting patients who had been in Hospital with me. There are 18 sisters on board under the charge of a matron, to attend the cot cases. There are 125 officers on board, five of whom are Australian, and about 1000 men. Ships course a zigzag one to avoid submarines. This ship was attacked on her last run from Mudros to Alexandria. Variation 10’. Each run being about 2 miles. Ship a very fine one of about 14000 tons, usually sailing between Canada and England. Ship in darkness at night, all Ports screened and all deck lights extinguished. Strict regulations regarding Sisters. They have their own reserved table for meals and are not allowed on deck after dinner. They also had a part of the deck allotted to them during daytime. Preliminary allotment of all passengers to boats.\n","295":"\n\nAgain a very nice day. I slept, read and ate all day. The meals we are much enjoying after our limited diet in Hospital. We hardly miss a course. All the patients who were with me in Hospital are here, and we have a table to ourselves. Boat drill again today – everybody taking post at their boats, wearing Life belts - In fact Life belts are worn continuously by everybody during the day, even when at meals.\n","296":"\n\nPassed Malta very early this morning but not close enough to get a good view. Very nice day. Again boat drill. Left feeling still very shaky otherwise I am getting stronger.\n","297":"\n\nFine weather but somewhat of a swell. As however I now appear to be a seasoned sailor I have felt no ill effects. Amused myself at piano in smoke room in afternoon. Sang a couple of songs. Nothing much that I know in Ships Collection of music. To bed about 8.30 each night and sleep splendidly.\n","298":"\n\nAgain fair weather but heavy swell. Boat pitching a good deal. She is empty and consequently well out of the water. Attended concert given in No 3 deck by the men. Very good indeed, especially their amateur band.\n","299":"\n\nArrived off Gilbraltar at 5.30 AM. Instructions received by wireless to enter port and coal. Forts search lights, examination boat etc made a pretty sight. Went into harbour at 9AM and berthed by 11 AM. Gilbraltar a most imposing sight. Passengers allowed ashore till 1 PM. which was time set down for sailing. Chief officer had gone ashore, and as no attempt was made to hoist a gangway I decided to go down a rope ladder. I did not realise till about half way down how weak I was, and my arms nearly gave way. After pausing a while suspended in mid air I sufficiently recovered to admit of my safely reaching the wharf.\n\nI walked alone into the town and roamed around till 12.30, when I returned to the boat. Being Sunday shops were closed between 10AM and 1 PM, so could purchase nothing. I got hold of a stationer who had his shop door ajar and tried to get postcards, but he was afraid to sell. He gave me three cards which I sent to Nell and the boys. I also sent cable to Nell. Weighed myself and found weight at 13.5. Still plenty of room to fill out uniform. Very fine substantial stone buildings in Gilbraltar, very English in type.\n\nI should have liked to inspect fortifications but time did not permit. Some of the officers who had driven into town in a jarry returned to the ship laden with cigars and cigarettes. They had obtained special permission from Chief of Police to get shops open. Ship was held up till 4PM, so some again went ashore after lunch and made some more purchases. I was much too tired to go. H.M.S. London our old Gallipoli friend is in harbour undergoing overhaul, also 2 other British Men o’War. Left Gib at 4.35. Took several photos with camera I had purchased just prior to leaving Alexandria. African coast very clear. Squalls coming up in West. At 6PM a huge pall of cloud like a mushroom hung over Gib making the most quaint picture imaginable. Stood straight out to Atlantic for 200 miles to avoid usual course. Under these Conditions it will be late on Thursday or early on Friday when we arrive at Devonport.\n","300":"\n\nVery heavy swell. Quite a number could not leave their cabins. Officers want to have a concert tomorrow night. Very stiff and tired after yesterday’s jaunt through Gilbraltar. Went to bed at 8.30PM. Roused at 10.25 by Orderly medical officer regarding closing of Ports. Had a heated altercation with him, but eventually had my way.\n","301":"\n\nShip rolled very heavily during last night. Many did not turn up to breakfast. I have not missed a meal so far. Swell moderated during day. Had concert at night to which Matron and sisters were invited, and was held in Smokeroom. All ale performers – I sang two songs – \"Goodnight beloved\", and \"In sheltered vale\". Finished at 10 PM.\n","302":"\n\nVery heavy swell again – drizzling rain. Very miserable day. Saw a number of whales during morning. Lay down most of the day.\n","303":"\n\nAt daybreak a French Man O War was just astern of us, and a British destroyer on either side. Man o’war left almost immediately, but Destroyers convoyed us into Plymouth Sound. We reached the entrance about 4PM, but as it was drizzling rain we could see very little. At 5PM we dropped anchor.\n","304":"\n\nGot up at 4AM to look at Forts search lights. Effect very beautiful. On deck at 7 AM. Fairly clear morning. A very beautiful spot. Verdant green hills and autumn tints on the fine trees. A Submarine passed us about 7.30. At 8.30 we up anchored and moved up 4 miles to a berth. A very interesting trip up. We passed many types of naval craft including the Tipperary, one of the newest types of destroyers. We also passed one of England’s old wooden walls, with rigging and decks manned by about 400 boys who are in training. They gave us most inspiring cheers as we passed. We berthed about 11 AM, a Hospital train was in waiting and those who were for London entrained and moved off at 12.45PM. The journey through Devonshire was very interesting. The trees and fields are magnificent and the autumn tints charming. We were served with Soups and Sweets as well as afternoon tea on the journey to London. We reached Paddington station about 7 PM, and were sorted out to different Hospitals.\n\nI was sent to No 3 London General, Wandworth Common S.W., also some of my fellow patients from Alexandria. We came in Sir Robert Balfour’s car, a very fine Rolls Royce. The doctor who was in our ward at Alexandria is with me in our Ward here, also Major Vernon.\n\nHospital staff supplied us with a very fine supper, and we retired at 11PM, thoroughly tired out.\n","305":"\n\nWent with Capt Sloper and Capt Walker RFA to town. Called on Colonel Buckley at Commonwealth offices and officially \n\nreported myself. Saw Col Flashman and Dr Waugh from Parramatta. Very poor offices. Col Buckley very kind indeed. Went to Army & navy stores to get Sam Browne belt, but could not get attention. Dr Sloper treated us to a motor run around the city and lunch at the \"Trocadero\". Returned to Hospital at 3PM feeling very tired. Men had a concert in patients recreation Hall at 4.30 PM. Programme contributed by outside people and was particularly good, especially the items of two Comedians. Wrote Charley and John, also cabled Nell.\n","306":"\n\nStayed in all day. In afternoon walked around Hospital grounds. In the morning wrote Nell, Alvord and Chris. This Hospital was originally a school, but since the wear broke out has been converted into a Hospital and many temporary wards erected, in all capable of accommodating 1500 patients. Lt Olding came in last night, suffering from excema. He tells me Callaghan has won his D.S.O. More power to him.\n","307":"\n\nExamined by Medical officer. I am to go before a Board tomorrow to determine how long I am to remain in England. The Colonel told me he expected they would give me a month with instructions to report and be re examined at end of that period. Had a letter from John Halford this morning – Smart reply to mine sent on Saturday afternoon. John called to see me at 4PM. Stayed to dinner. Had a long yarn about things in general. Arranged to see him tomorrow.\n","308":"\n\nWent before Medical Board. The old Colonel wanted to give me 6 months in England, but I persuaded him to allow me 1 month in which to recuperate and to report at end of that period. Major Vernon sentenced to six weeks.\n\nSaw Lt Hodgson. 2nd Brigade. Leg still very bad. While with him Mrs Hobbs and daughter with Lt new March called. NewMarch much improved.

Took 11.30 PM train via NorthEastern from King's Cross Station to Edinburgh.\n","310":"\n\nArrived Edinburgh about 8 AM. At once found my way to Leith Docks. Got aboard H.M.S. Vulcan and sent a message off to Charley on Zealandia.. Went back to North British Hotel at Waverley Station, had breakfast at 11 AM. Just after lunch while in my room Charley bounded in. Our meeting was certainly emotional. We had of course quite a lot to talk about. After afternoon tea went down to Dalmey where Charley’s pinnace hauls in alongside the Forth Bridge. I went off with him to his ship. Had a long talk with Capt Harbord. Found Charley’s progress was quite satisfactory. I endeavoured to arrange 10 days’ Charley coming to London. The reply is to come through tomorrow. Hope it will be granted. Magnificent view of Forth Bridge and river from bank. River full of naval craft of all kinds. The 3rd Battle Squadron has its H.Qrs here. Entrance under bridge netted. Two new fast cruisers passed out just as we were boarding the launch. Beautiful sunny day. Retired at 9PM, dead tired.\n","311":"\n\nCharley turned up just before lunch but only had leave for the week end. We caught the 2.20 PM train for Bradford and arrived there about 8.30. All very glad to see Charley. Edith appears to be a fine little woman and I don’t wonder Charley likes to spend his holidays there. She seems to have mothered him splendidly and I feel very grateful.\n\nWent to bed very tired.\n","312":"\n\nWent down into the town during the morning. Met most of Halford family at their place of business. Bought leather dressing case for Charley. Went to Halfords (Senior) for tea. Met George there. He has just become engaged to a Birmingham girl.

Very interesting Country. For the most part arable land, some cultivated, well timbered and watered. Most buildings are of brick roofed with tiles, but in a very bad state of repair and apparently very old and neglected. The A.D.C. to General Cartwright Commanding 1st Divisional Artillery met me at the train with the General’s car and drove me out to the Headquarters in the village of Mazingarbe. The whole district is given over to mining, these coal mines behind our lines being at work, while those in the immediate vicinity of Artillery fire are closed down. General Cartwright had arranged for me to have my meals with his mess, and a very cosy billet for me with an old French lady named Madame Hennequet, who with her daughter has remained here in the old farm throughout all the shelling, so far without hurt. There is a fine pear orchard attached to the house. Electric light is supplied from the mines (but temporarily\n\ncut off) and a Sewerage System is installed. A Capt Heslop, 21st London Regt (Territorial) is also billeted in this house and fills the appointment of \"Town Major\", a multitude of duties being allotted him.

Head Quarters Divisional Artillery are housed in a very nice two story residence recently occupied by a doctor, while Divisional Headquarters are located in a magnificent Chateau owned by a wealthy mine proprietor whose income I am informed reaches £300,000 per annum._\n\nBrigade Major during afternoon explained on the map the disposition of the enemy’s and our own trenches, specially with relation to the recent advance and capture of Loos.\n\nOn my return to my Billet after dinner I was held up by three sentries in succession and had some difficulty in establishing my bona fides until I communicated by phone with the Div Arty Bde Major.

Saw 8\" Howrs (converted from 6\") in action against Country left of Loos, known as Wingles Towers, also 4\".7 and 9\".2, the latter on railway mountings. Enemy shelling our Front line very heavily. Saw French 6\" guns adjoining our 8\" also section of 13prs on special carriage as Anti Aircraft guns. Just beside DAHQ and on the right front also close to DAHQ are batteries of French 75s. Enemy had 4 captive observation balloons up while we had one. After lunch enemy’s Artillery fire was very brisk for about an hour, and during this time I counted 18 Aircraft overhead, about 12 being British.\n\nThe \"Archies\" were busy on them from both sides but did no damage. Lavish use of steel rails and joists, also timber beams from buildings in dugouts. Plenty of bricks available. Generally \"dugouts\" very deep and comfortable. Gunpits sunk about 2’.6\" and embrasure about 2.6\" high from original ground surface. Overhead cover of steel joists, brick and earth, generally about 5 feet thick. Batteries generally worked as a whole, the Major being forward. Country very flat. Dumps from mines serve as vantage points and observation stations. Chalk underlying soil. Fuzes now numbered to 100. New delay action percussion fuse for H.E. Shell. The 9\".2 guns are on Railway mountings on mine lines. Met Capt Hanbury Davies (from Sydney) with 8\" Howrs. He enquired after Major Watts with whom he attended a course. Another Subaltern (whose name I have forgotten) from Sydney University is with the 25th Brigade. Quite nice day. Roads very muddy and fields very soft.\n\nArranged with General Cartwright to visitLoostomorrow, where I shall be able to see the village, which has suffered bombardment from both sides and is a veritable shambles.\n\nLast night the whole country was brilliantly illuminated with the enemy’s and our own flares. Very little Artillery fire during night and nearly all came from our guns. Wrote today to GHQ and to Base Commandant re wire concerning place and date of departure.\n\nI have asked permission to return via Boulogne and Folkestone instead of via Havre which would mean a much longer journey.\n\nMonday 6th December\n\nAfter breakfast went out with General A.D.C. to Fosse 7 where a number of guns of this Division are emplaced. Enemy was shelling this position very vigorously with 4\".2 High Explosive, so we decided it was wiser to keep on a flank in a field rather than go to the actual gun positions until such times as enemy’s fire ceased. After about an hour fire died down and eventually ceased. We then moved forward and inspected two French Batteries of 75s, three 18 pr batteries, 6\" Howitzers, 4\".5 Howitzers 4\".7 and 8\" How batteries. We saw all these in action for a 6 minutes bombardment of the enemy’s lines, and it was a very inspiring sight to see all theses guns Loosing off at once, about 50 guns in all in an area of perhaps not more than 20 acres.\n\nOur guns are all very well dug in, excepting Seige Artillery, and have good overhead cover, but the French batteries had only splinter proof roof, one having no cover at all. Sun shining brightly and atmosphere clear so I had a good view of distant trenches and all artillery fire. General Cartwright was called away this morning so I did not get to Loos. This trip is deferred till tomorrow. Met today Major General Holland CB, commanding the Division and General Budworth commanding the Corps Artillery. Colonel Scott, commanding one of the Artillery Brigades here is ordered back to England to take up munitions and Ordnance work, and is naturally very sore at having to leave a fighting unit. Our Artillery now appears to have plenty of shell here, as this morning’s bombardment clearly demonstrated.\n\nAttended lecture at night given by an Engineer captain regarding construction and maintenance of trenches. I gave them details of our trench work at Gallipoli. Lecture held in large Residence set apart for instructional purposes. Any officers who in the immediate future are to have command of companies etc are withdrawn from units and put through a thorough course, inspecting the fronts during the day and receiving instructions from lectures at night.\n\nAll horses, both British and French are stabled in the villages, tethered to brick walls which surround the houses of better type. Many are accommodated in side streets and in specially constructed shelters of timber and iron or ruberoid.\n","357":"\n\nWith Brigade Major motored out to vicinity of Fosse 7 on Lens Road then walked past the old British line to crest of ridge (Hill 65) just overlooking Loos, and from the trenches here observed a bombardment carried out by our Artillery at 10 AM. Shooting appeared very good. The 9\".2 Howr battery engaged a small building near the edge of enemy’s lines, which has been harbouring machine guns. It fired 26 rounds, 2 of which were blind, several fell within a few yards of building, but the last two shots absolutely demolished the building. Our aeroplanes were overhead and one had 47 shrapnel fired at it in the space of 1 minute. When returning to DAHQ we called at and watched the 4’.5 Howr battery at work at Fosse 7, and immediately on our leaving this latter spot the enemy commenced shelling with 4\".2 shell. We had just left in time. After lunch I watched 9\".2 Howr shooting. It is a wonderful gun, firing a 290lb shell of which 4 a minute were actually fired.\n\nThe service of the gun was very smart. Range about 10,000x. I also watched 6\" guns adjoining firing a series. These have a range of 20,000x and have frequently fired at 17,500x. These 6\" guns and 9\".2 Howrs are placed in the garden surrounding Divisional Headquarters, and on my way to them I passed a very beautiful pond, with very tame white swans swimming about quite at home there notwithstanding continual artillery fire.\n\nCol Scott commanding 25th Brigade has today received his orders to report to England at once for munition work. He has an Advanced Ordnance Certificate. He is very much annoyed at having to leave. While out in the advanced positions this morning one could see any quantity of equipment of all kinds lying about, and between our new lines and the Enemy’s, many dead bodies, which no one dare bury. There are also several demolished field guns (German) and dummies.\n\nThe buildings inLoosand adjoining villages are sadly damaged and especially the magnificent machinery buildings of the various mines, which must have cost millions to put in position. The4 destruction of property is colossal. Nearly all French troops here wearing new steel helmets. British are still generally wearing the Field Service cap, though a few steel helmets are issued for use in the trenches.\n\nWednesday 8th December\n\nWhile General Cartwright was out on inspection duty I went round to watch the 6\" and 9\".2 Howrs shooting. I met Colonel Vincent commanding the Heavy Artillery and had a long interesting chat with him. The 9\".2 especially did good shooting. Quite a number of aeroplanes, both ours and the enemy’s were overhead. During the afternoon one plane had no less than 137 rounds fired at it in four minutes, but no damage done. Divisional Head Quarters have kindly given me every facility for observing the frontage here and have supplied me with maps etc, so that all future movements of troops in this area I shall be able to follow with ease when I have returned to Gallipoli. I find that Generals Budworth and Cartwright were subalterns in the same battery in India with S.S.M. Hobson (from Queensland).\n\nMet Gen Holland at DAHQ tonight. He asked me to dinner tomorrow night after I have given a lecture to the Officers school on \"Operations in Gallipoli\". Enemy shelled Mazingarbe last night, killed a few men and wounded some horses, besides doing damage to buildings. Several shell fell near DAHQ and made the women domestics in the House seek the cellar. Col Scott left for London. Plenty of London motor busses in this locality.\n","358":"\n\nWith generals A.D.C. left D.A.H.Q. in car at 6.15 AM. Went for some distance along Lens Road, then dismissed the car and walked into Loos. Made a thorough inspection of this town. It has been terribly shelled and is absolutely a heap of ruins. There is hardly a house that has not been hit by shell. While we were there a number of shell were sent over, but did no damage. Quite a number of French and British troops are billeted among the ruins and debris. Saw an old German Battery position with quite a lot of Ammunition lying around also wicker ammunition carriers. I brought one away with me, also a shell, as a reminder of my visit to Loos. Hope later on to go beyond Loos into the forward Infantry trenches. Prepared two maps of Gallipoli about 4ft square to illustrate lecture. Lectured to about 60 officers including Maj Gen Holland C.B. D.S.O., and Brig Gen Cartwright D.S.O. I think the lecture proved to be interesting and instructive. After lecture General Cartwright and myself proceeded to Divisional HQrs and dined with the\n\nDivisional Commander and his Staff. Dinner would have done credit to any of the best London Hotels. Divisional Band performed during the evening. Very fine Dining room in the Chateau.\n","359":"\n\nHad breakfast at 5.30 at 1st Div HQrs. General Holland had arranged to send a staff officer to conduct me round half of the firing line trenches. This officer (Capt Dobbie) took me in the cra as far as Quality Street, Fosse 7. We then walked through the rear ofLoosand inspected front line trenches including the Chalk Pit, where a 4\".% How is being emplaced. Trenches were in a terrible condition – sandbags have in many cases fallen in taking the walls of trenches with them. water and slush ankle to knee deep.\n\nVery few men supplied with gum boots though. Altogether conditions exceedingly bad. Returned to Vermelles via Popsen Alley which was awful with mud. Picked up car at Vermelles, reached home at 10.30 AM. Had lunch with General Holland. After lunch he drove me out 16 miles to Fenay, where his Division is billeted when in rest. Here he has a bomb school in progress. Selected and proved officers and N.C.Os are appointed as Instructors and a proportion of men from each battalion is put through a fortnightly course of instruction.\n\nI saw all varieties of hand grenades and bombs successfully thrown in actual trenches specially prepared. The following are to be seen:- Machine guns – Lewis and Maxims, rifle grenades, catapault grenades of two varieties, 11’2\" and 4\" French Mortars. General Staff gave me book on bombs etc. Passed through a very beautiful agricultural country also mining. School is housed in romantic old Chateau. Had dinner at Div Arty HQrs and after dinner had along talk with Gen Cartwright and his Staff Capt, Capt Pile, re life and customs in India, they both having served some years there.\n","360":"\n\nBy arrangement with Gen Holland I breakfasted at DHQ at 5.15AM and left with him and Col Longridge at 5.45. to see the remainder of the trenches held by 1st Division. We motored out almost to Hulluch, then took the trenches and moved through the balance of the first line trenches and the first support trench.\n\nExceedingly heavy rain had fallen during the early morning and the men were miserable looking beings, while the trenches were past\n\ndescription. A number of land slides had taken place during the night and in consequence it was really unsafe to move along the trenches, one’s head being often well exposed. Luckily no one was hit, though a good many rifle bullets passed by us. We returned tom Vermelles and had a good look at this town, the scene of much sanguinary fighting. The buildings are all shattered as the result of shell fire. Boarded the car here and reached home at 11.30, miserably wet and dirty. For at lEast 2 miles out of the 5 miles we walked, the water and slush in the trenches were well over the knees, and I was very thankful I had brought my trench waders with me. After lunch I went in General Cartwright’s car to Bethune and had a good look at this very interesting town. The Central Square with its quaint tower, and the old church are places of interest. There are many very excellent shops and the inhabitants are doing a splendid trade with the Soldiers. On my return to Mazingarbe I received a wire from London ordering my immediate return to Weymouth.\n","361":"\n\nHad an early breakfast and then made preparations for my return to England. Said goodbye to all the officers and left in General Cartwright’s car (kindly placed at my disposal) for Boulogne. On the way across, about 80 miles, I called at the HQrs of the Corps to which Gen Holland’s Division belongs. The General Staff there under Brig Gen Montgomery were very kind to me and sent me off with a number of aerial photos of trenches inLoosarea, also maps etc.\n\nWe reached Boulogne at 4.30PM. I immediately reported to Embarkation Office and was informed a steamer was just about to leave with about 300 officers and men on leave to England. I accordingly got aboard. The run across country in their car was very interesting, the villages particularly being very picturesque. Women are now largely cultivating the fields and it was a Common sight to see women ploughing the fields nearLooswhile the enemy’s shells were falling in the same field. The French are cultivating their land everywhere right up to the firing line. We left Boulogne at 5.15, convoyed across the Channel by a Destroyer. The night was very stormy and cold and I was very glad when we arrived at Folkestone. We left for London by train at 8.45 and arrived at Victoria Street Station at 10.45 PM. I then took a taxi to \"Whitehall\".\n","362":"\n\nPeople at Whitehall very surprised to see me again. They thought I would be almost out at the Dardanelles. Called on Colonel Buckley, and got him to telephone Weymouth asking if Transport was ready. Informed not yet arranged for. I therefore got permission to remain in London till boat was ready when Staff would wire me. I found General Hobbs was in town, so Col Buckley invited me to meet him and General Walker at lunch tomorrow. This I agreed to. I purchased a few small articles of kit, called on Miss Cowlishaw, met Major Vernon who has also to report at Weymouth and then returned to Hotel to lunch. About 3 o’clock I received a telephone call from Col Buckley telling me that a wire had just been received from Weymouth ordering all officers to report at once. I accordingly caught the 4.50 train and reached Weymouth about 9PM. Reported by phone to Base Camp. Still no word of boat.\n","363":"\n\nReported out to Commandant A&N.Z. Base. Found there was still no word of boat. Very annoyed because I could have met General Hobbs in London, and I wanted to know a good many points about Dardanelles Commands. Instructed to stay at Royal Hotel till officers and NCOs (about 100 of each) are ordered off. The Staff rather think we shall return on a mail boat, but nothing definite is known. Wet miserable day. Stayed in all afternoon writing letters to all at home, Charley, Gen Hobbs & Edith Halford. After dinner I repacked my bags again, disorganised because of my trip to France.\n","364":"\n\n* \nAscertained that boat would not leave for a couple of days at lEast. Wired Colonel Buckley telling him that I had tomorrow available and asked if arrangements could be made at Buckingham Palace for Investiture of C.B. Gen Hobbs, Col Cannam and several others were to be decorated today. Received wire from Col Buckley stating that special Audiences have been granted by His Majesty for tomorrow. Left Weymouth by 7.20 PM train and reached waterloo about 1 hour late.\n\nNo taxis available. Walked to Whitehall Hotel, Russell Square. Very glad to get to bed.\n","365":"\n\nCalled on Colonel Buckley at 10.15. Attended at Buckingham Palace at 12.20. met by Capt Wallington, well known in Australia. Ushered into the King’s presence at 12.30 punctually.\n\nHe welcomed me with a hearty hand shake. He remained standing though still lame as the result of his recent accident, and still requiring the use of a stick. He discussed the work of the Australians in Gallipoli, and I was able to tell him some details of our Artillery work hitherto unknown to him. He told me not to be surprised if Military requirements demanded our withdrawal from the Dardanelles for more useful work elsewhere. He was very much interested in the progress of the R.A.N., and incidentally expressed great admiration for what Australia had done in the war. \"I only regret\" he said \"that the Australians did not have an opportunity to fight in France beside our Home troops and the Canadians.\" He continued talking to me till 1 PM. Then he presented me with the Insignia of a Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, at the same time thanking me for what I had done for the Empire, and wishing me success and God Speed upon my return to duty. On my leaving he again shook hands with me. During the afternoon I called on General Walker at No 17 Park Lane, then went on to Miss Cowlishaw’s to dinner. Afterwards she took Mrs Dr Phipps and myself to the Haymarket theatre.\n","366":"\n\nCalled on Colonel Buckley. Got a number of Gen handbooks, and map of Gallipoli and Balkan States.\n\nSaid Goodbye to Miss Cowlishaw. In afternoon saw General Hobbs and learned full details of Gallipoli up to time of his leaving at end of October. I also saw Col Coxen. Went to bed very early. I was very tired.\n","367":"\n\nCalled on Mr Chomley at British Australasian Office. Got books re Anzac Operations. Lent them to Alice Paul to read and asked her to send them on to Nell when she had finished with them. Caught 12.30 train for Weymouth. Major Vernon came with me. Reached Weymouth 4.30 PM and reported to Base Commandant.\n\nStayed to dinner at request of Col Sir Newton Moore. Amusing incident at Hotel re my German Shell. GOC District wanted to Confiscate it, but that was not in accord with my ideas and did not \"come off\".\n","368":"\n\nLeft Weymouth at 10.15 AM for Devonport. Reached there at 3.30PM. At once went aboard the \"Ionic\" a White Star Liner. She is carrying and English Battalion, (East Lancashires) 2 Corps of Engineers, a Field Ambulance, and our party consisting of about 60 N.Zealand and Australian officers and about 120 NZ and A. N.C.Os. Left wharf at 4.15. Tug caught us up later with our baggage, the ship being unable to wait at wharf because of falling tide. In the gathering dusk I noticed a destroyer convoying up, and we took our last look at England for perhaps a very long time.\n\nExceedingly glad to be once more on the move, notwithstanding the fact that my stay in England and France has been exceedingly enjoyable and interesting. Saw H.M.S. WARSPRITE in dock at Devonport. She has evidently been in Collision, for her bow is being repaired. She is a sister ship to the \"Queen Elizabeth\".\n","369":"\n\nWhen I awoke this morning I found our Destroyer Escort had left us. A very beautiful day. Sea very calm. Have been sorting over my boxes today. I hear we shall probably call at \"Malta. I hope so, for so far I have only seen this important naval station from the sea. A beautiful moonlight night. The famous Bay of Biscay is treating us handsomely. Ship exceedingly comfortable. Though my bed seems a trifle narrow after the beds in England. I have a nice comfortable cabin to myself. Commencing to read up my books and thus refresh my memory again for my Artillery duties. Lt Col Rickman of the East Lancs is O.C. troops. This Regiments band played for us very nicely yesterday afternoon as we dropped down Devonport harbour to Plymouth Sound, and also again this afternoon. Had a good look over the 4\".7 gun placed aft. I think we could give a good account of ourselves if a submarine came around.\n","370":"\n\nAnother beautiful day. Spent bulk of the day in darning socks.\n","371":"\n\nAll boat stations allotted in case of Submarine Attack. I am in command of boat No 15 with\n\nthree other officers, including a N. Zealand Army medical Lieut Colonel, and 48 A.S.C. men. Received by wireless the news that our troops had evacuated Suvla and Anzac. Everybody very sorry to hear it. We all hoped to see the Dardanelles propositions through. I understand we are to hold Helles and to temporarily control the entrance to the Dardanelles. Wireless states our loss in withdrawal was three men wounded. Sounds rather too good to be true, but we are informed withdrawal was made in a thick fog. I wonder is my baggage lost or otherwise.\n\nI think I can trust my orderly officer to bring it off if at all possible. Wrote to Nell, all the boys, Mother and Edith Halford ready for posing tomorrow at Gilbraltar.\n","372":"\n\nWireless news states that Asquith announced in the House of Commons withdrawal from Gallipoli cost only three men wounded. Six guns were abandoned the type not being specified, but they were absolutely destroyed before being left.\n\nBand’s efforts today especially good. Several numbers encored. We are now nearing Gilbraltar and will arrive about 10PM, by which time I shall doubtless be in bed.\n","373":"\n\nArrived off Gilbraltar at 11.PM. last night. Ordered to go in to \"Gib\" for orders. Upanchored again at 11.30 PM and continued on voyage. We are now being escorted by two T.B. Destroyers, H.M.S. Alcorn and Shelldrake. So we feel reasonably safe. Band again played during morning and afternoon. Muster parade for Ships boats and fire drill at 4PM. A Committee has arranged sports for Officers and men to be carried out during the period between Xmas and New Year. Had a very enjoyable concert in Dining Saloon during evening, the band contributing several items. I sang \"Nazareth\". Some of our \"young bloods\" very merry and continued their exuberance of spirits till 1.AM.\n","374":"\n\nChristmas day here again. The last one I spent in Egypt and a great deal has happened since then. Awakened at 6 AM by the Band playing in various parts of the Ship. \"Christians Awake,\" \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" and \"O Come all ye faithful\".\n\nDuring the day we passed along close to the Coast of Africa. The rugged background of mountains in colour reminded me of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, and they were heavily capped with snow. Passed a dozen mine sweepers at work. Sports held during the day. The men thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Officers competitions commence tomorrow. Specially nice dinner arranged this evening. We Anzacs usually dine at 6 and the British Officers at 7, the dining saloon not being large enough to accommodate all at one sitting, but tonight we divided the officers into groups with an equal number of British and Anzac officers, thus ensuring a better knowledge of each other. One of our officers again forgot himself and for a time made things a little unpleasant. A very nice Church Service at 10.30 this morning. It was quite a treat to hear the troops lustily singing the old Christmas hymns.\n\nSunday 26th December\n\nA comparatively quiet day although Boxing day. Church parade at 10AM. Quite a full attendance. Band performed during morning and afternoon. In the afternoon a corporal of the East Lancs sang solos (with band accompaniment) very effectively. Heard by wireless that a Japanese passenger boat had been sunk near us in the Mediterranean with considerable loss of life. Wrote letters to all the family – and to Alice Lindsay for posting tomorrow at Malta.\n\nMonday 27th November\n\nArrived off Malta (Valetta) about 8.30 AM. Some delay in passing through entrance because of a collision inside between two boats. Saw a French Cruiser outside and one of our own submarines passed us going in. Took several photos as we entered Harbour. Finished our morning at Buoy 12. Hope they turn out well.\n\nBumboats pestered us round the ship – Boys diving for silver, copper would not tempt them. Went ashore immediately after lunch.\n\nObtained permission from the Superintendent of Police to take photos in Malta. Wandered round a good deal. Saw S.John’s Church, the Museum opposite, Library, palace, Armoury etc and altogether had a most interesting afternoon. Bought some Maltese lace for Nell. Streets very narrow and well crowded, even goats being given street room, and the owners halting at various houses with their goats and drawing off milk as required. Milk must be fairly cheap as one owner was wishing to sell rather a good\n\nspecimen of a goat for 18 pence. Met Lts Pybus and Hare, both invalided to Malta on account of dysentery. I hear all our mounted units have returned to Egypt while the Infantry are remaining for the present at Mudros. Should very much like to put in a week here. Could spend the time very profitably and enjoyably.\n\nUnderstand we are to leave here at daylight tomorrow. Returned to the ship at 5.30 PM.\n\nTuesday 28th December\n\nInstructions given last night to unload a quantity of frozen mutton, so we shall not leave Malta till tomorrow morning. Major Heane D.S.O. and myself went ashore at 11 AM to spend the day. Went to Borgs shop, Strada Reale no 269 and we each purchased a silver tray in Filigree work. Had a wretched lunch at Westmister Hotel, took some photos, and then took train from Valetta station to Notabile or Cetta Vecchia, the old capitol before Valetta was built and declared. Here we visited the ancient Catacombs which are exceedingly interesting, saw girls making lace and visited the Cathedral. A Service was in progress and enhanced the beauty of this wonderful building. It is wonderfully decorated with marble and paintings, the floor is of marble covering the tombs of ancient notables. The old fortifications are very interesting and from one wall a magnificent panorama of the greater part of the island is obtained, including Church of Musta with its famous dome, and St Paul’s bay in the distance.\n\nTook several photos of French Battleships lying in Grand harbour. The \"Ernest Renan\" Armoured Cruiser 6 funnels launched March 1906 of 13644 tons and complement of 750. Her Armament four 7\".6, twelve 6\".4, sixteen 9pr, eight 3pr, two 1prs and two submerged 18\" torpedo tubes. The battleship \"Republique\" 3 funnels, launched December 1903 of 14865 tons, complement 793. Flag Ship. Armament four 12\", eighteen 6\".4, twenty-five 3pr, two 1pr, two submerged 18\" torpedo tubes and 3 above water. The \"Combet\" (launched September 1911), \"Jean Bart\" (launched","375":" and \"Paris\" (launched","376":" 3 funnel Dreadnoughts of 23,467 tons . Complement 904. Armament twelve 12\", twenty two 5\".5, four 3prs, four submerged 18\" Torpedo tubes. The \"Chateaurenault\" of 4 funnels was also there but I could not obtain particulars of her. Our old Sydney friend ‘H.M.S. Euryalis\" the cruiser (once the Flag Ship in Sydney Harbour) was also in Port. She has 4 funnels, of 12,000 tons, complement 700, Armament two 9\".2, twelve 6\", thirteen 12prs, three 3prs, and two submerged\n\n18\" Torpedo tubes. We returned to the ship to dinner, and afterwards Major Heane and myself went ashore again, roamed round Valetta, & bought views, etc. Walked through the suburb of Floriana, over the granaries, and returned to ship at 9.30 PM.\n\nOur stay here has been exceedingly enjoyable. Heard tonight that our evacuation at Gallipoli was exceedingly well planned, and though 19 Hospital ships were sent there in case of serious casualties, they all returned empty. I shall obtain full particulars from my officers when I get to Alexandria.\n","377":"\n\nLeft Port at 8.30AM. As we passed between the French Battleships our band struck up the \"Marseilles\", \"God Save the King\" and a number of patriotic airs, while the band on the French Flagship played \"Tipperary\". Very hearty cheers were given by both French sailors and our troops. We are now moving without an escort. Passed several ships shortly after we left port, including a Hospital Ship and a French mailboat. Competitions, boxing, wrestling, deck billiards, deck quoits etc continued. Boat stations practised. Guard mounted against possible submarine attack. Course set Northwards. Mt Etna visible covered with snow. Played draughts at night with majors Vernon and McIntosh.\n","378":"\n\nA private of E. Lancashire Regt (an Officers Servant) died last night from heat apoplexy. Very hot during night and yesterday afternoon. He was buried at daylight this morning. Competitions continued during day. Col Field and myself signalling. East Lancs’ officers entertained Anzac officers at dinner tonight. Oppressively hot.\n","379":"\n\nAt 10.30 AM this morning a submarine periscope suddenly appeared about 200 yards from the ship on the Port Beam, as we were about 100 miles S.E. of Crete. Before our stern gun could swing round on it, it had disappeared, and we could distinctly see the trail of a Torpedo from the Submarine coming towards the Ship. The Captain’s bridge is high up and has affine command. He saw the Torpedo coming and immediately swung his helm \n\nhard over, throwing the ship to Starboard. The torpedo in consequence missed the ship and passed us about 50 yards astern. \"Thank God\" ejaculated the Captain. The alteration of course had also the effect of throwing the Submarine itself astern of us. The Captain put on full speed and we travelled all day and tonight at about 151\/2 knots. We saw nothing further of the Submarine.\n\nA fully armed guard was maintained around the ship all day and in consequence our Sports programme had to be abandoned. A wireless message was sent out immediately and picked up by a Man O’ War about 100 miles distant. This ship then warned by wireless all ships in the vicinity.\n\nWe had a very close call and everybody was quite relieved when darkness came on and gave us a chance to run a straight course with comparative safety. \n\n \n\n \n","380":"\n\nVery close watch kept all day for further submarines but nothing seen. Arrived at Alexandria at 12.30 PM. Anchored in outer anchorage. While at anchor a Mine Layer passed us, bringing in what appeared to be a number of survivors from a wreck. Took several photos. Appended is a copy of Log entry by Capt. Davies R.M.S. Ionic concerning the attempted torpedoeing of his ship:-\n\n\"S.S.Ionic Transport – 2186.\n\nAt Sea.","381":"\n\nSubmarine Report\"\n\nAt 9.40 am Lat 34° 11’ N Long 25°11’ E sighted the Periscope of a Submarine abeam on Port Side about 500 feet away. We immediately put the helm hard a port and brought the submarine right astern. As the ship was swinging the submarine fired a Torpedo, but passed astern missing the ship by about 100 feet, the same being visible for a considerable distance after missing the ship. Lost sight of the Submarine periscope after bringing her astern. Signal given for all hands Boat Stations, everybody being at their Stations in 3 minutes. Signalled engines to utmost speed and kept submarine astern. At 10.40 AM dismissed boat Stations. Extra men in stokeholds up till noon.\n\nExtra armed guards posted fore and aft until sunset.\n\n(Signed) J. Davies\n\nCommander.\n\nSunday 2nd January.\n\nMoved into berth in inner harbour early in the morning. No information as to our movements till after lunch. The \"Tsinan\" moored alongside us with Australian troops from Gallipoli on board. One of my Headquarters Sergeants happened to be aboard her and saw me on my ship. He sent round to me to say he had all my Gallipoli baggage and samples of shells and fuzes for which information I was very grateful. Received word to catch 4 pm train for Cairo. Arrived Cairo at 7.30 PM Went to Continental Hotel. Reported to General White Army Corps H Qrs at Shepheard's Hotel. Stayed night at Continental Hotel. Had dinner with Major & Mrs. King. Saw a number of Australian Officers.\n","382":"\n\nWith Major King left Cairo at 11 AM, arrived at Tel el Kebir Camp at 1PM. Reported to General Chauvel at Divisional Head Quarters. Took over my Brigade as from 2nd inst. All officers and men very glad to see me. Spent the day in looking through old Orders since my leaving Gallipoli. Found a number of letters for me from Nell, the boys, father, AJ Derrick, A King, Halfords, also a Christmas parcel from Halfords and Balaclava Cap from Nell.\n","383":"\n\nLooking round my Brigade and getting my baggage etc fixed up in my tent.\n","384":"\n\nCalled at Divisional Head Quarters re position of Artillery Command. Informed each Brigade Commander was to act independently and in direct Communication with DHQ. Major Anderson to be temporarily attached to DHQ until further arrangements are made. Saw Colonel Christian. Stated he was in Command of Div. Artillery. Above ruling upsets this suggestion. Had a ride on Jack. Both my horses looking very well. Very cold weather. Quite wintry. Mess being run very well. An excellent cook was made available from 8th Battery. Overstrength both in men and horses at present time. \n","385":"\n\nAnswered a great deal of correspondence. Letters which I found awaiting me here. Brigade drawing tents getting telephone lines laid etc.\n\nFriday 7th January\n\nDiscovered today an extraordinary state of affairs in Regimental Post Office. A man was caught throwing opened and unopened 3rd Brigade outward mail into the incinerator. Someone has evidently been pilfering. Instructed Major Burgess to investigate the case. Corporal in charge of Post Office placed under arrest. Commenced erection of Brigade Canteen.

All batteries doing good work and specialists well forward. Had dinner with General Hobbs at night, Major Marks accompanying me.\n\nTuesday 8th February\n\nMade a reconnaissance during the morning of extreme southern portion of 3rd Brigade Training Area. Orderly brought me word that we were to proceed by afternoon train to Serapeum. (Brigade and Battery Commanders, Adjutants, range takers orderlies horses etc. By dint of a great deal of bustling we left Tel el Kebir at 5 PM, reached Camp Station Ismailia about 6.30, and there discovered no connection had been arranged for between Camp Station and Serapeum. On consulting the D.A.D.R.T. at Ismailia we found we could get no further till 10 AM tomorrow. We therefore all walked down to the French Club at Ismailia (of which all British Officers are made honorary members), and had dinner there. While at dinner Major Burgess and Capt. Forbes came in and told us of their experiences on Camels in front of our Canal line. We returned to the Camp Station after dinner and each man made up a bed for himself among bundles\n\nof hay lying on the platform. Everybody in rather bad temper and very dissatisfied with faulty staff arrangements.\n\nWednesday 9th February\n\nSlept very comfortably during the night. Had early breakfast. Saw Aerodrome at this Station and watched two planes ascend. Quite a large number of troops camped here. Arranged with R.T.O. that we should again entrain and move off for Serapeum at 10 AM. We entrained, but for some inexplicable reason we did not leave Camp Station till 2.30 PM, and did not reach Serapeum till nearly dark. Both today and yesterday all the officers as well as men have had to ride in trucks without seats, and naturally the journey was exceedingly uncomfortable. On arrival at Serapeum I reported to D.H.Qrs, was told where our camp was to be pitched, got our tents erected, horse lines arranged for, and our evening meal prepared. Turned in early, but ground was uncomfortably hard.\n\nThursday 10th February\n\nWent out early with my officers to the Left Flank of position held by 1st Australian Division and made a general reconnaissance. Saw three deer on the journey out. We are again to work with the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and the Battalion Officers made us very welcome, giving us lunch and watering our horses. Returned to camp about 5 PM.\n\nFriday 11th February\n\nOut on the front line again to day. Battery Commanders finally settled and marked the position for their batteries. I made a thorough reconnaissance of country in front of position. Returned to camp at 5.30 PM.\n\nSaturday 12th February\n\nAgain out to day. All ranges and prominent points recorded, and work completed. Lunched with General Maclagan. Also met General Birdwood at 3rd Bde. H Qrs. He expressed his pleasure at seeing me back again well and strong, and then gave me details of the proposed changes in 1st Aus Div. consequent on new Divisions being raised.\n\nHe told me I should have to command a Division of Artillery and that my Brigade would form the neucleus of the 4th Artillery Division. The new 4th Division will be commanded by General Cox, an Indian officer. Fuller details I presume we shall soon receive. We left Serapeum by train at 7.38 PM reaching Tel el Kebir about 10 PM. Our men and horses are following by a later train. A set of 6 maps of country just East of the Canal was issued to me.\n\nToday I pass my 41st milestone. How the years do fly. General Birdwood’s information quite a nice birthday gift.\n\nSunday 13th February\n\nChurch parade this morning, but I was too tired to attend. Mail received from home.

Batteries on manoeuvre area all day. Col. Heane 1st Battalion called to see me. Said Infantry Battalion had already been divided for new Divisions.\n\nTuesday 15th February\n\nBatteries on manoeuvre area all day. Generals, Birdwood, Cox, Carruthers and Hobbs inspected lines. Gen. Birdwood and Cox gave me details of new 4th Division. It appears definite that my Brigade is to form the neucleus of the new 4th Divisional Artillery, so very shortly I shall have a heavy task before me, but as long as I am allowed to keep my old officers I think I shall be able to manage fairly well. Received letter from Chris (telling me he was not returning to HAYFIELD College) also papers from Nell, but still no letter. Received birthday greetings cable from Nell. Discussed new formations with General Hobbs. He desires to retain 8th Battery (W.A.) in his command, and proposes giving me the 2nd Battery (the old 44th) in exchange if Corps H Qrs. will agree. I personally do not mind, though I should very much prefer to keep my old Brigade intact. Several officers & men of 3rd Bde. mentioned in despatches.\n\nWednesday 16th February\n\nGeneral Hobbs left for Ismailia re formation of new Divisional Artilleries. Brigade on manoeuvre area. Handed in maps of Artillery dispositions at Serapeum to General Hobbs.\n\nThursday 17th February\n\nBrigade and unit Commanders paraded to General Hobbs. He gave us details of new Divisional Artillery. I am to Command 4th Division, Col. Christian the 5th. The 3rd Brigade is not now to form a definite part of the new Division but is to be lent temporarily to assist in the Organization. Brigade Commanders have now to submit recommendations to General Hobbs for appointment of officers and promotion of N.C.Os. and presumably the new allotment of Officers, NCOs. and men will be made almost at once. I have written to George Halford offering him the appointment of A.D.C. and have also recommended Capt. Waites for Brigade Major and Lieut Forrest as Staff Captain.\n\nWas informed this evening that recommendations for my Brigade Commanders are Major King, Major Hughes and Lt. Col. Tunbridge with the following Battery Commanders for Colonel Tunbridge:- Capt. McLaughlin, Capt. Riggall and Capt. Jopp. I expect there will be some heartburnings over the new selections and appointments. I have written to Colonel Buckley for a complete supply of military books etc.\n\nFriday 18th February\n\nAll Brigades busy on details of new Formations. All Brigades of 1st Division are providing their quota. These were paraded (together with the officers who are to be transferred) before General Hobbs at 4.30 PM General made a short farewell speech.\n\nSaturday 19th February\n\nAll selected officers, N.C.Os. and men for new Brigade of 4th Division paraded before General Hobbs at 9.30 AM. He explained the expansion of Artillery now going on and wished them well in their new positions. General inspected lines at 11 AM. Very satisfactory. Ordered last night by General Hobbs to place Capt. Parry Okeden under arrest and to\n\ninvestigate charges made against him of using obscene language and of being drunk. With Major Burgess took summary of evidence, examining many witnesses. Papers forwarded on to General Hobbs.\n\nSunday 20th February\n\nWith General Hobbs attended at office of Major General H.V. Cox, who is to Command the new 4th Division. We discussed details re new Artillery formation, training etc. I assured General Cox that he would receive my best and most loyal service, and also that of Officers and men.

Quite a nice little dance was in progress at the Hotel but I took no part. Had a long talk with General Howse and Colonel and Mrs. Christian.\n","415":"\n\nLeft Cairo at 11 AM on the return journey to Tel el Kebir reaching there at 1 PM. Col. Tunbridge wrote asking permission to go to Serapeum with General Hobbs and party to see proposed Artillery position. I told him I considered he was trying to run before he had learned to walk and his place was with his unit. However I let him go.\n\nSaw General Hobbs at night concerning the new Brigade from 1st Division. Incidentally confidentially discussed matters re supervision of Officers. Supplied Capt. Parry Okeden with charge sheet and summary of evidence re his Court Martial on Tuesday next. Wired for Major King to regain his unit.\n","416":"\n\nRabett called to see me re his protest against being superseded. Officers of","417":" Division left for Canal Col. Tunbridge accompanying them.

He returned to Ismailia by midday train.\n","418":"\n\nInterviewed Gen. Cox re formation of new Division and obtained his consent to proceed to Ismailia to see General White and get a clear understanding regarding the whole scheme. Saw General White who approved my method of putting a trained neucleus to each Battery and Brigade. He however told me it was now decided to have 4 Battery Brigades, and in addition a 3 Battery Howitzer Brigade to each Division. The","419":" Anzac is to leave very shortly, and Gen. Hobbs and Col. Johnstone are being asked if they can raise the Divisions to the new establishments without recalling the personnel just transferred to 4th and 5th Divisions. Both Gen. White and Gen. Birdwood are decidedly against the return of the personnel to the parent units, but still if time will not permit of the new establishment being raised, this personnel will possibly be asked for.\n\nOn my return to my Head Quarters I informed the Brigade Commanders confidentially of what I had heard. Our Battery numbers will now be altered, but possibly the Brigade numbers will be retained.\n\nGen. White informed me I may have some difficulty in securing George Halford’s appointment as A.D.C., because of his not being an Australian, but as the appointment is a personal one I think Gen. Birdwood will allow it, particularly in view of \n\nthe number of officers required under the new organization. Court Martial on Capt. Parry Okeden commenced. Col. Grimwade (\nPresident\n) was not present at appointed time, and orderlies had to search everywhere for him. He had received no intimation of his appointment to the Court.\n","420":"\n\nParry Okeden’s Court Martial continued. Saw General Cox and gave him particulars re yesterday’s interview with Gen. White. Capt. Dixon reported to me for duty with 4th Division, but asked permission to remain with 4th Brigade till end of week. Received permission from Gen. Cox to communicate direct with Infantry Brigade and other Units regarding gunners and artificers of all kinds for transfer to 4th Divisional Artillery. Received yesterday a big bale of newspapers and magazines etc. for use of 3rd F.A. Brigade but as I have now left that unit I sent them to 4th Divisional artillery. Had pay book amended for new rates of pay. Col. Christian spent an hour with me discussing new expansion of Field Artillery.\n\nThursday 2nd March\n\nAs I half expected I to day received a wire from Gen. White informing me that he regretted it was found necessary to take back 12th Brigade to enable Gen. Hobbs to get his Division, as per new establishments, ready for departure in 28 days. It is rather a \"set back\" but cannot be helped. I have accordingly made arrangements to hand back the whole of the personnel tomorrow, or as soon as asked for. I shall see General Cox in the morning and get his permission to go to Ismailia to see General White so that I may be able to get – once and for all – a clear understanding as to what tables I am to work under and when I am to commence work. His wire said that Gen. Birdwood would consider Halfords application for a commission if he first enlists in the A.I.F.\n\nAll the 1st Division are at cross purposes over the new organization and expansion. There must be a huge shuffle all round before anything like order can be obtained out of the present chaos.\n","421":"\n\nCalled on General Cox this morning. I found he was going to Ismailia by the midday train to see General White, and he asked me to go with him and jointly try to get details regarding the 4th Divisional Artillery finally settled.\n\nGen. Cunliffe Owen and Colonel Elliott RE accompanied us in the train. Had ¾ hour with Gens. Cox and White. Was definitely informed that 12th Brigade was to be handed back to 1st Division, but that balance of Officers, NCOs. and men were to remain with me unchanged. I pointed out that 1st Division was keeping six Majors while Col. Christian and myself were getting none. Gen. White said he would give instructions that some allotment of Majors should be made to the new Divisions.\n\nCopied out particulars re Artillery Division from Gen. White’s Part VII. Had a very pleasant walk through the avenues in the Gardens and went to the Jetty and listened to band playing on H.M.S. Sir Thomas Picton\". Met Colonel Holland of Sydney and his son. Had dinner on the train on the journey back. Met Colonel Grimwade on board. On reaching my tent I received a signal message from Gen. Hobbs asking that Lieut. Garling should be sent back to 1st Division. As he had been officially posted to 4th Div. Artillery I would not consent to handing him back without authority from Head Quarters. Col. Christian spoke to me on the phone. He is going to see General White tomorrow morning.\n","422":"\n\nRabett called to see me during morning and stated Gen. Hobbs had sent for him, showed him a wire from General White asking for Rabett and Olding to be transferred to 4th Division. Gen. Hobbs gave Rabett a chance to come and see me to ascertain what appointment he would have if posted to 4th Div. I told him he would have a Brigade, so he has told the General he has decided to accept.\n\nWith Capt. Waite looked out fresh permanent site for 4th Divisional Artillery.\n\nPrepared plans of Camp Site for whole Division. Major Rabett posted in orders to 4th Division and he will therefore not now be passed over by other Officers of 1st Division.\n\nSunday 5th March\n\nReceived message this morning asking me to call at Gen. Hobb’s Head Qrs. tomorrow at 11.30 to meet General White. I hope therefore that all Artillery appointments will be settled finally. Called on General Monash, Col. Glasfurd and Col. Glasgow re drivers, gunners, fitters, smiths etc. for transfer to 4th Divisional Artillery. Discussion with Gen. Monash re Officers Club. I informed him the Artillery had so much to do in reorganising that we should have no time to participate.\n\nMonday 6th March\n\nHad a long conference this morning with Gen. White, Gen. Hobbs and Col. Christian re appointments to new Divisional Artillery. Gen. Hobbs was very loth to part with any officer, but eventually Major Rabett was definitely posted to me and also Lt. Richards as adjutant, while Major Caddy goes to Col. Christian. Lt. Vowles also goes to Christian but unless I am given another Brigade Commander from 1st Division I shall ask for Vowles. I hope now to get our machinery into working order and make a definite start with training.\n\nI am told I am to have some men from 2nd Remount Squadron so I shall go into Zeitoun tomorrow to inspect and select. New Camp Site fixed for 4th Div. Artillery.\n\nI am informed 1st and 2nd Divisions will leave almost at once while 4th Division will for the present take over FERRY POST Station at Ismailia, and 5th Division ditto at Serapeum. I presume when all danger of a Turkish attack is over we too shall move to France.\n\nTuesday 7th March\n\nSpent day with Brigade commanders in getting organization of New Divisional Artillery under weigh. Called on Head Quarters 4th, 12th and 13th Brigade re recruits. Camp being pitched on new site. Watched officers at tent pegging. Received two letters from Charley and one from Alice Paul. Charley seems to be doing well on his new ship and appears to like the company as well as the ship.\n\nWednesday 8th March\n\nWent up by 7 AM train to Cairo re recruits for New Div. Artillery. Spent the day with Col. Christian in Cairo, came down with him in evening train. Gen. Murray Commander in Chief M.E.F. also on train.

Officers mess established, only Div. Staff now remaining with 3rd F.A. Bde. Capt. Frazer posted to Signal Co. 4th Division. Very pleased. He is a good fellow.\n\nFriday 10th March\n\nWrote to Gen. Hobbs re getting from 1st DA certain N.C.Os. and men to be given commission in 4th D.A. He refused to let either N.C.Os. or men receive promotion. Received report from Major Rabett re recruits in Cairo from Light Horse etc. Prospects good, but great difficulty in overcoming Departmental red tape regarding the transfer of men, and movement to Tel el Kebir.\n\nReceived congratulatory cable from Edith Halford also one from George. He has not received my first letter offering him Commission. Have written him again, also his CO to allow him to accept and get out quickly.\n\nLetter from Gen. Cox saying he will spend next Monday morning with our men of 4th Div Arty Wrote to Brigadier of Infantry Brigade 4th Div., re transfer of suitable men to 4th DA.\n\nSaturday 11th March\n\nReceived long report from Rabett re Light Horse at Cairo. Sent same on to General White for his information and necessary action.\n\nLarge number of Artillery promotions published, but list not \n\ncomplete. Men at present on strength of 4th D.A. busy pitching tents, getting ready for Light Hose and Infantry drafts. Gen. Chauval had parade of 1st Div. Artillery and said \"Good bye\" to them. I understand he is vacating the Command of 1st Division but know no details. Instructed by Gen. Godley to get into touch with C.R.A. 1st Division re gun positions at Serapeum, it being understood 4th Div. is to take over this line later. Fortunately I know the ground and will not need to make a fresh visit. Received letters from Alvord, Chris, Nell, Emma and Father & Mother.\n\nSunday 12th March\n\nPrepared Circular memo to send to C.Os. of all units at Tel el Kebir re Anzac BOOK. I happen to be President of the Committee. I interviewed a number of men of 4th and 13th Infantry Brigades who desire to transfer to Artillery. Arranged with the Brigadier that they should be transferred over tomorrow. The 1st Divisional Artillery had an exercise to day with personnel and guns in the field. Gen. Cox to inspect 4th DA tomorrow morning at 10 AM.\n\nMonday 13th March\n\nGen. Cox round Camp. He promised to secure for me 400 men per Infantry Brigade for transfer to Field Artillery. Instructed me to see him at 2.30 tomorrow with Capt. Parry Okeden. Col. Tunbridge appointed A.A.G, Cairo, and left camp to day. Rather strange that 2 weeks since he should have been quite suitable as a Brigade Commander for my new 12th Brigade, but when it is transferred back to 1st Division he appears to be unsuitable. Inconsistency somewhere.\n\nSaw Smith of Light Horse candidate for Commission, also Battye and Thomson, 2nd Lieuts of 50th Battalion who desire transfer to Artillery. Received letter from Gen. White stating no more assistance can be expected from 1st Division. I shall therefore post Waite to the Command of 24th Howitzer Brigade. With this latter appointment my Brigade Commanders are complete, and a good lot they are. I will try to secure Vernon for Command of D.A.C. Then we should have a good team of C.Os. L.H. Squadron attached to 4th and 5th Divs. arrived in camp tonight.\n\nTuesday 14th March\n\nInterviewed Lc. Sergt. Keene of 1st L. Horse re Commission. Approved his application.

Expect to get about 1200 men from Light Horse during next few days.\n\nGen. Hobbs to day had a nasty fall from his horse.\n\nInstructed Capt. Parry Okeden that HQrs. had ordered his return to Australia. He asked to be allowed to resign here, and I recommended that course to the General.\n\nFriday 17th March\n\nReceived letter from Charley. Inspected 400 men of 12th Infantry Brigade and had them transferred this afternoon. A few men reported from 1st D.A.C. Rabett returned to Cairo. Sent Col. King to Serapeum to show New Zealand and Argyleshire Artillery our forward positions selected for our Artillery. Evidently it has been decided for us to remain here to fit out & train.\n\nWe shall be well satisfied. Interviewed some very likely N.C.Os. from Light Horse who are desirous of obtaining commissions, also Lt. Copley","423":" L.H. and two Infantry Subalterns.\n\nHad copy of letter from Gen. Birdwood sent to me, showing that he has asked M.E.F. for 8 Majors or Captains for 4th & 5th Divisional Artillery. Capt. Parry Okeden ordered to return by \"Demosthenes\" to Australia leaving Suez on Sunday.\n\nAbout 1300 men now in 4th D.A. Camp.\n\nSaturday 18th March\n\nI hear that 1st Divisional Artillery is to move early next week, leaving all equipment behind and that we are to take over equipment, camp site etc. The 4th Div Arty are now working in groups for each Brigade and doing good work.\n\nSunday 19th March\n\nWent to Cairo by 11.30 train. Saw a number of Light Horse officers at Continental Hotel, met Christian and Rabett, and discussed arrangements re Light Horse personnel. Had a conference with about 25 L.H. officers at night. They seem a likely lot. Major Waites batman killed.\n\nMonday 20th March\n\nCol. Christian and myself called on Gen. Sellheim re transfer of L.H. to two new Artillery Divisions. Handed him complete nominal rolls and all papers. There should now be no further hitch. Gen. Howse told me he had 50 AMC. drivers at Tel el Kebir who desired to transfer to Artillery and asked me to take them. On return to camp at midday I found 1st Brigade getting ready to move off, and they actually left about midnight. Shooting during the day, my young officers being present. Dined with Gen. Cox. Discussed a good many details of training etc. He approved my sending in Hobson’s name for a Commission.\n\nThe Prince of Wales is to inspect the camp on Wednesday. Gen. McKay who is to command the 5th Division arrives tomorrow. Saw General Bates in Cairo regarding horses for 4th Div Arty. Not much chance at present of getting suitable type.\n\nTuesday 21st March\n\nThe 2nd Brigade struck camp and left Tel el Kebir to day for Alexandria. Future destination not definitely known. Gen. Hobbs and staff also departed. Said \"Good bye\" to him. Howitzer Brigade took over site of 1st Brigade, 10th Brigade having yesterday taken over guns, equipment, etc. of 1st Brigade. 11th Bde. to day took over equipment of 2nd Bde and 10th Bde will occupy their vacated site. By the end of this week we should be well established in new quarters, both Brigades and also my HQrs. We have taken over General Hobbs’ site.\n\nGen. McKay took over command of 5th Division.\n\nWednesday 22nd March\n\nThe Prince of Wales inspected camp. He was accompanied by Gens. Birdwood, White, Cox and McKay, together with plenty of staff. He is a very shy boyish individual. Gen. Birdwood presented me to him, and I in turn presented my Brigade Commanders. Gen. Birdwood in a few nicely chosen words told of the doings of myself and Brigade Commanders at Gallipoli. Our men made a very good showing, the Prince wanting to know why they were in helmets instead of hats. The innovation is only for the summer while drill jackets are being worn.\n\nPaid over all Brigade funds of 3rd FA Bde to Col. Burgess and received his receipt. The 3rd Brigade struck camp and departed. Col. Rabett’s Brigade (the 12th) took over all equipment etc., and as soon as the site is thoroughly \"sunned\", the 11th Bde will take over. Engineers are erecting meat safes for all Batteries.\n\nThursday 23rd March\n\nCalled at 4th Div. H Qrs. re disposal of reinforcement personnel now in Tel el Kebir camp. Had 141 transferred to 4th Div Arty, but officers not yet transferred. With Col. Armstrong inspected Camp Sites for 12th Bde and D.A.C. Decided to put 12th Bde opposite the \"Hyderabad Lancers\" and the D.A.C. on ground at present held by 4th Div Arty. Paraded applicants for commissions before General Cox including Hobson. General gave all applicants a very sensible address concerning their future. Canteen contract completed with Mangerites. To open on Monday next.\n\nFriday 24th March\n\nAgain at HQrs. 4th division re reinforcement Officers. No authority through from Anzac as to their future. Moved over on to ground latterly occupied by General Hobbs and established office. Convened Field General Court Martial re one of Col. King’s men. Heard at HQrs. that I have to take over two 18 pound How Battery at Moascar, Ismailia. At Col. Duncan’s request I put in a strong minute showing why it would be inadvisable to do so and how much better for the training of 4th Div to send guns to Tel el Kebir, allowing us to continue training here, unless tactical consideration absolutely compel us to go to the Canal. The whole of 4th and 5th Divisions are ordered to Canal, but I think the Artillery will remain here for the present.\n\nTook photos of a huge crowd of camels here today. They are to be used in Transporting 4th & 5th Divisions to Canal.\n\nSaturday 25th March\n\nReceived note from Gen. White this morning re Major Waites promotion. I immediately went to Ismailia, saw General White, and got the whole matter settled. Major Waite is to receive his promotion in orders tomorrow to be appointed to the Command of a Brigade. Gen. Hobbs has been trying to get Major Spurge appointed, but I managed to give such information as left Gen. White no alternative but to appoint Waite.

The monitors were the \"SCARAB\" and \"APHIS\". Being again a terribly hot day I stayed on board and went with him down to his Station in the BITTER LAKE returning to my HQrs. at 7.30 PM. It seemed no cooler on the water than on the land, the wind was scorching, but on the boat they had plenty of ice, so we filled up with iced lime juice and soda, and really delicious it was. They keep a couple of cHameleons on board as fly catchers.\n\nFeel very seedy. I think I got a touch of the sun this morning. Received two letters from Nell and one from Chris.\n","483":"\n\nShooting again this morning but I did not feel up to attending. The heat is again as bad as ever, it is real Hell.

Asher who has an anti aircraft Battery. Stayed at Hotel de la Tete de Boeuf. The roads and scenery are magnificent. For many miles beautiful trees skirt the road sides, making fine shady avenues. The country is closely cultivated and looks its best. Flowers of all kinds, scarlet poppies especially skirt the road sides.\n\nSunday 18th June\n\nHad a look at Asher’s Battery. Motored on via Aire to Hazebrouck thence to Caestre where our Divisional Artillery Head Quarters are situated. Beautiful roads again and splendid scenery. Found Capt. Forrest had made good arrangements for Head Quarters and myself. Informed by Divisional Head Quarters that I am to Command the Division during the absence on leave of General Cox. Lieut. Gen. Plumer who commands the 2nd Army of which we form part wants to see us tomorrow so the two Brigades who have arrived here will \"March Past\" on some suitable road.\n\nMonday 19th June\n\nArranged for inspection of 11th and 12th Brigades by Gen. Plumer. They made a very good showing and he appeared pleased. During afternoon I motored to Ballieul, located 2nd Anzac then motored on to Armentieres. Called at HQrs. of N.Z. Division also D.A.H.Q.

Division.\n","513":"\n\nDuring the morning General Sir Douglas Haig and General Birdwood officially visited this Division. As acting G.O.C. Division I accompanied them during their inspection of 24th FA Bde And 12th Infantry Brigade. The Commander in Chief appeared very pleased, spoke very nicely to Officers and men and welcomed them as fighting troops. He spoke to me a good deal while riding along about the proposed Australian Army but said our forces were too small to admit of the change.\n\nBalance of DAC arrived. Hughes and Rabett on leave to London for 7 days, but I am afraid we will go into the line at very short notice, and they will probably be recalled.\n\nFriday 23rd June\n\nProceeded with the formation of one Heavy and three Medium Trench Mortar Batteries. D.A.C. Commander ordered to find personnel. Newly appointed Subalterns will be posted to these Batteries. Went to Corps Head Quarters. Took Corporal Benson with me and he made a water colour sketch of the HQrs. buildings. We then went on through Hazebrouck to Cassell, and here also Benson made a sketch of the town, prominently situated as it is on a hill with the Church of Notre Dame and 2nd Army Head Quarters building showing up prominently in the picture.\n\nSaturday 24th June\n\nSpent the morning with Col Vernon re formation of Trench Mortar Batteries. Got everything satisfactorily arranged. Visited Divisional HQrs and dealt with Court Martials etc. Obtained Road Passes for Staff and Brigade Commanders from A.P.M. and also arranged re \"Gas\" lectures for all Brigades. Applied for 7 days’ leave from 27th inst., being the day General Cox returns.\n\nVery heavy Cannonade through the night and early morning from the direction of Armentieres. I expect we shall have enough of it soon. Sent new officers to Calais for personal equipment etc. Two men of 12th Bde. sent forward on 21st inst. were wounded today.\n\nSunday 25th June\n\nAt 7 AM closely inspected the personnel of all Trench Mortar batteries. Published their composition in orders. Detailed officers and personnel. List of appointments to Commissions in Division approved by me published in Div. Orders.\n\nSaw Gen. Birdwood at La Motte. Arranged with Colonel Griffiths re transfer of Capt. Asher. With two Brigade Commanders attended at Trench Mortar School, Berthen under Major Gen. J. Keane D.S.O.. He very kindly showed us around. Mortars are very effective and should prove a great boon in co-operation with our Artillery. Came through Hazebrouck on the way back from La Motte. \n\nArranged to go round gun positions of 2nd Aus Div Artillery tomorrow with General Birdwood.\n\nHave just received word that of the two men of 12th Brigade wounded yesterday, one has died.\n\nMonday 26th June\n\nMet General Birdwood at Armentieres Station. Brought out Col Waite and his Adjutant to look over the gun positions they will eventually work from. With Col Grimwade inspected Left Group. Watched an interesting German 5.9\" series against a Supposed Battery emplacement which had not been used as such for six months. The real battery position was about 350 yards N.E. from the spot shelled. The Germans ranged very carefully with the assistance of aeroplane and then put in about 200 rounds, all excepting 10 detonating beautifully. Splinters flew all around where we were standing, some 400 yards away, a couple of which I picked up. Not a man was hit and no damage done except to the unoffending field. A costly mornings work to no purpose. Partly walking, partly riding bicycles, we inspected the Centre Group under Lt Col Lloyd and the Right Group under Lt Col Cohen. We found the emplacements generally very good – plenty of suitable material is of course available – very different to Gallipoli. Orchards, hedges and buildings, give plenty of opportunity for screening of guns. Officers generally in this Division have never been to Gallipoli, and I think are unduly puffed up with their achievements here. I am perfectly satisfied our officers and men will do well. Those already allotted to Batteries are proving their worth. Returned via Merris to Caestre. Called at D.HQrs. re trench mortar School and satisfactorily arranged for personnel of next two classes. Gen. Birdwood refused my leave, saying I could not be spared at the present juncture. I am not particularly keen on getting it, but I want to get George Halford fixed asA.D.C. It seems rather a difficult matter to get one man from England.\n\nAs far as I can learn, future movements of troops generally will mean my leave will be blocked for some considerable time. All personnel of M.T.M Batteries sent to School at Berthen.\n\nTuesday 27th June\n\nGeneral Cox at my Head Quarters. He told myself and my C.Os. of an interview he had with Gen. Birdwood last night. Gen. Plumer is doubtful lest 4th Aus Div Artillery may not be sufficiently advanced to take its legitimate job in connection with forward move, and if not the 4th Aus Div Infantry will\n\nnot be used, but N.Z. Division will be transferred temporarily to 1st Anzac. Therefore it beHoves us all to do our very best to be ready, which I feel confident we will be. Gen. Cox inspected part of","514":" Brigade and D.A.C. Very wet and farms very muddy.\n\nI called at Army HQrs Cassell and arranged for our Div Artillery supply of maps of Armentieres-Laventhe Sector, also called at Mortar School Berthen re attendance of personnel.\n","515":"\n\nWent out with Capt. Forrest to look at Billetting areas suggested for us near Ballieul. A miserable day, very wet. Not much progress made. Sent more personnel (telephonists) to Batteries of","516":" Aus Div in Firing line.\n","517":"\n\nWith Capt. Forrest called on Gen. Johnstone","518":" Div Artillery. Took down Col Rabett and his Orderly Officer and they had a look around Col Lloyd’s positions. With Gen. Johnstone I went round O.Ps. of 2nd and 3rd groups. Not a good view from any one of them. Observation appears very difficult.\n\nArranged for all Brigade Commanders to take up their residence with 2nd Aus Div Group Commanders.\n\nRaids have been very successful. Eighteen German Sausage balloons brought down along the line yesterday through being bombed with phosphorous bombs by our Airmen. Quite a good bag. Had lunch with Col Lloyd. Arranged to send half the Heavy T.M Battery personnel to 2nd Aus Div for experience.\n\nCol King and Hughes on court Martials also Capt Richards. Heard full details of German raid on 20th Battn of 5th Brigade when two Stokes T.Ms were lost, also Court Martials on officers concerned, one of whom was acquitted and two sentenced to loss of seniority. Also details of new type of British plane flown by recently Gazetted pilot, who landed it unharmed in the German aerodrome at Lille, mistaking it for ST. Omer. He lost his way – had not previously been in France. Arranged to move tomorrow to temporary billets in Erquingham pending General Johnstone’s departure for his Head Qrs. Raid arranged by Colonel Brand for tonight.\n\nFriday 30th June\n\nTook Colonel Vernon to 1st Anzac Ammunition Park to meet Col Tunbridge re ammunition supply to Division. Drew full supply. Met Gen Johnstone and discussed with him necessity for getting more B.Cs. He has promised to let me have Major Williams and Capt. Aiken. Gen. Cunliffe Owen called and explained proposed operations up north.\n\nArranged to put into 2nd Div Area 8 Batteries on July 4th. Took Gen Johnstone to La Motte. With Col. Griffiths discussed re getting two officers from 1st D.A. Wrote official letter to DHQ, got General Cox to minute it, and had it sent by special messenger to Corps. I think this will all be satisfactorily arranged. Officers reported having left Southampton for 4th D.A. Col. King and Col. Hughes completed Court Martial.\n\nAll Brigade Commanders going to our Battle Zone tomorrow. Pitiable to see little children going to School, all carrying gas helmets. Raid last night very successful. Killed 100, captured 7 and a number of trophies such as rifles, grenades, revolvers, helmets, etc. Our losses 8 killed 17 wounded.\n\nSaturday 1st July\n\nAll Brigade Commanders took up quarters with 2nd Division and commenced to learn their groups. Capt. Richards and myself moved into Erquingham pending taking over from General Johnstone. Called on Col Grimwade re his gun positions and O.Ps. D.A.C. took over all ammunition complete from Park and will issue tomorrow to Brigades.\n\nCapt Asher from Abbeville called to see me. His transfer not yet through. Lt Fox from Gen Holmes Brigade – a Trench Mortar Officer – called to see me re transfer to 4th Div Arty. I interviewed General Holmes and agreed to take him. Intense bombardment commenced at about 9.30 PM and continued till 1 AM I do not know whether our guns or the enemy’s were causing the disturbance, but detonations were one continuous roll like thunder with occasional heavy bursts, the latter rattling the windows and doors.\n\nI returned to Caestre during afternoon and remained there the night. A peculiar type of aeroplane was towed past our billet about 10.30 PM, nationality I could not discover.\n\nReceived wire from Corps stating that Lts Evans and Sheppard were transferred from 1st Aus Div Artillery. Major Williams and Temp. Capt. Aiken from 2nd Div Artillery, and Lt Coe cabled for from England. My difficulties re Battery Commanders are therefore now ended. Lt Evans reported to me this morning, those from 2nd Division tomorrow, Lt. Sheppard on 5th on return from leave, and Lt Coe as soon as he arrives.\n","519":"\n\nMoved to Erquingham. Spent the morning with Gen Johnstone. At 10 AM met Gen Nicholls at Gen Johnstone’s HQrs., then went on to HQrs. of 1st Aus Div Certain Artillery promotions were decided on by C.R.As. Then followed a conference re operations South and North and changes in taking over the line.\n\nThere were 17 Generals present, including the two Corps. Commanders, all Divisional Commanders and all C.R.As.\n\nIt is now probable that 1st and 2nd Div. Artillery may be moved South to assist in operations there. It has also been decided that 4th Aus Div shall take over from 1st Aus Div also half area now held by 2nd Aus Div, the remainder of 2nd Aus Div Area being added to N.Z. Division Area. This means our guns have a more extended front to watch, and in addition the 1st Aus Div Area is new to my officers, it being understood we were to take over from 2nd Aus Div Called my Brigade Commanders together and explained altered conditions. Col Waite put his Brigade in Col. Cohen’s group during the night, and balance of Div Arty ordered to be ready to move instantly when called upon. Very interesting watching shelling of aeroplane and sausage balloons.\n","520":"\n\nAt 8.30 at Gen. Johnstones HQrs.

On outbreak of war he rejoined and has been in France continuously. He appears a very capable man and should be most useful.

Waite joined with Gen. Monash in a special rehearsal of a Barrage. Gen. Christian and some of his officers to afternoon tea.\n\nAsher reported for duty as D.T.M.O., also Lieuts. Carse, Challoner, Scarrat and Walker – the former from Anti Aircraft Battery at Abbeville and the others from England.\n\nSunday 9th July\n\nForwarded recommendations for promotion to Major of Edwards and Richards, also to Capt. of Evans, Sheppard and Asher. Great difficulty last night through being ordered at 11.30 PM to return 1st Div. T. Mortars by 5 AM today. Interviewed 5 officers being superseded by Asher, and explained reasons for my recommendation. No objection raised.\n\nHughes shooting last night very effective against parapets, and dead bodies counted in the morning. Another scheme this afternoon for Right and Centre Groups, and tonight schemes continuing through the night, bombarding all German roads on our front. Saw Gen. Cox with regard to Gen. Monash’s complaint re slow response of Left Group Artillery last night.\n\nMonday 10th July\n\nGeneral Christian with me all the morning. Went into maps and positions generally. Batteries wire cutting during afternoon. Took Gen. Christian round to O.P.s during afternoon per bicycle. Infantry of 5th Division moving in, ours moving out. Our artillery expected to hand over to 5th Div. on or about 14th inst. and then we expect to go south. No strafe tonight as Infantry of 4th and 5th Divisions are in process of relief.\n\nPlenty of aeroplanes overhead during the evening, the \"Archies\" also being particularly busy. Trench mortars returned to 1st Aus Div Arty\n\nTuesday 11th July\n\nOrdered as President of Court Martial on two officers. Very unpleasant task. At 6 AM commenced a tour of the whole of our Sector of trenches and finished up at L'Armee at about 11.15 feeling very tired. Trenches here are really not trenches but built up parapets. Communication trenches alone are excavated. Parapets are an average of 12 feet thick in the centre and 6 feet at top. A tremendous amount of work has been done.\n\nOur 4th Inf. Bde. very sorry to leave. They are so compatable – a great contrast to Gallipoli. Their spirits are irrepressible. In the parapets and immediately behind are innumerable \"dug outs\", named in most extraordinary fashion. One \"Dill Macky Villa\", others \"Kosey Korna\", \"Latrine View\", \"The War Lord’s Lodge\", \"The abode of Love\", etc. Some parts of the line have been badly shelled at times, and \n\nwe in turn have equally strafed those of the enemy.\n\nGerman planes were today endeavouring to get over our gun positions but our AA guns kept them back. We are doing some more strafing today.\n\nGeneral Christian and his staff here again this afternoon.\n\nSecured some old photos of positions here and aerial photos.\n\nBenson is making me a few sketches of the locality in colour.\n\nWednesday 12th July\n\nAttended at Div HQrs. during early morning. Informed Division is moving south, but its Artillery is not to go at present. Court Martial at 10 AM No arrangements made. Prisoner’s friend did not appear. Witnesses late. Had to let the matter slide.\n\nReported to 6th and 4th Divs. also 1st Anzac. Finally got matters settled and arranged to convene at 10 AM tomorrow.\n\nBatteries wire cutting during afternoon. Arranged for billets at Croix de Bac to which place we go tomorrow after handing over to General Christian. Gen. Coates, CRA, 61st Division adjoining on the south called on me together with his Brigade Major.\n\nThursday 13th July\n\nMoved into new Quarters lately occupied by General Legge at Croix de Bac. Attended Court Martial at 10 AM Spent the whole day on the cases. Sent Capt. Baker (Judge Advocate) home to Ballieul in the car.\n\nBatteries moved out of the line and handed over to 5th Aust Div (also Group Commanders). A good deal of firing during the night.\n\nFriday 14th July\n\nAgain attended Court Martial at La Rolanderie Farm. Adjourned for lunch and resumed at 3 PM. Prisoners (Officers) found guilty and both sentenced to be cashiered. Very unpleasant task. General Godley called to see me during the evening to inform me of the forthcoming operation in the Sector. I have been attached to 2nd Anzac staff, and my batteries are loaned to 5th Division who are now in the line to supplement their artillery. The 5th Aus Div and the 61st Div whose boundaries adjoin are to have an attack during the next two days. They are being supported by extra infantry, my Batteries, and an added number of heavy guns.\n\nI shall now have the opportunity of seeing both the operations here and those down south while attached to Gen. Godley’s staff. Discussed details with Gen. Christian to whom my artillery will be attached, and arranged to hand on batteries during tomorrow morning. One’s arrangements are never certain for two consecutive days. We have just withdrawn from the line, and expected to get two or three weeks of strenuous manoeuvre behind the line – instead, we are sent back again into action. However it is all practice in moving at short notice, and incidentally is discipline for one’s temper.\n\nSaturday 15th July\n\nCalled at DA","523":" Div. Interviewed Gen. Carey, G.O.C. R.A.","524":" Corps. Also met Colonel Allerdyce and Gen. Nicholl. The latter informed me he is being relieved from his duties at 2nd Anzac. Lent Forrest and Bates to Christian re ammunition and orders. In fact the orders were drafted by Bates. After lunch I went round to HQrs. of our three groups in","525":" Div. Area, Bates helping our Battery Commanders. I returned to Croix de Bac about 6 PM and went to the Kite Section R.F.C. close by.\n\nThe Kite balloon was up, but as light was fading it was hauled down while I was there. A very uncanny thing it appears to be. Basket carries two operators, and is fitted with parachutes for forced rapid descent. Balloon was up 2000 feet.\n\nAll our batteries moved into position in the open during the night, dug in, and DAC supplied ammunition.\n","526":"\n\nReceived message from Gen. Godley re visit of Australian and New Zealand Parliamentary Party. Called on the General at La Motte. He asked me to meet them, show them round this area, and take them back to Boulogne.\n\nMajor Studholme to look after New Zealanders.\n\nMonday 17th July\n\nCarefully inspected all 15 Batteries of Division, also Group Commanders HQrs. Operations postponed because of hazy weather. Heavy artillery registering. Included are 9.2\" Howrs., 12\" guns, 6\" Howrs.,\n\nTuesday 18th July\n\nWent to La Motte and there received instructions to go to G.H.Q staff at Amiens, thence to Boulogne. Major Studholme did not come. Reached Amiens about 2 PM, via Hazebrouck, Lillers, St.Pol and Doullens. Had lunch at Hotel de Rhin and left immediately afterwards with a Member of Intelligence Staff (Lt Col Wilson) for advanced G.H.Q. at Beauquesne. Thence returned to Amiens, and had a walk round the interesting and historic city. The Cathedral particularly interested me, also the various Canals (from the Somme) which cut through various parts of the town, and have tenements rising perpendicularly from their banks. Stayed at Hotel du Rhin.\n\nWednesday 19th July\n\nRose at 3.30 AM and at 4 AM motored out to the scene of Battle beyond Fricourt. I took Benson with me to make some sketches. I went through the village and wood of Fricourt and from the North Eastern edge of the Hill I got a magnificent panorama of the country we have been so successfully working in. The village itself is absolutely destroyed and the Woods are stripped of branches and trunks shattered with shell fire. The ground too is honeycombed with huge shell holes. Heavy shelling of the Boche position was in progress. We inspected the old German trenches and dugouts. Many a score of German graves are in the vicinity, all neatly marked with Green painted wooden crosses. As noting German thoroughness many name plates were of enamel, with names of deceased, date of death, regiment etc. also enamelled.\n\nOur Heavy Artillery was forward about 3000 yards of the Original German Front line. I returned to Amiens via Albert. Here the Church of Notre Dame has been badly damaged with shell fire. Benson made a sketch of the ruins. Church was just nearing completion in","527":" when it was shelled. Cost 7,000,000 Franks. Received from Col. Hutton Wilson details of Parliamentary tour. Delegates timed to arrive at Boulogne about 11.30 AM today. Left Amiens about 10 AM and passed through billets of 2nd Div Artillery close to the City. HQrs. 1st Anzac are at Vignacourt.\n\nReached Boulogne about 6 PM via Abbeville, Hesdin (where I arranged motor Transport for visitors), (Montreuil G.H.Q. where I arranged for passes) Etaples (Australian Base Training Depot) and St. Etienne, taking the coast road from Etaples. Stayed at the Folkestone Hotel, Boulogne. Met Col. Griffiths and took him to \n\ndinner with me. Spoke to 2nd Anzac on phone. Was informed our intended operations eventuated today. Succeeded in entering German trenches, but British troops on our Right were not successful and as a venture it failed. We secured about 150 prisoners and killed a number of Germans, while our casualties I understand total about 4,000.\n\nDelegates arrived from Parisand stayed at Folkestone Hotel.\n\nThursday 20th July\n\nLeft Boulogne about 9 AM for Calais. Col. Nicholson S.O.O. met us there, showed us round Ordnance shops, stores, Bakery etc., and took us all to lunch at Hotel Maritime. Australian Party consisted of Senators Keating, De Largie, Watkins, Barker and McGlynn, also Mr. Josiah Thomas, Burchell, Hampson, Palmer and Orchard. Lord Burnham accompanied them.\n\nAfter leaving Calais at 3 PM we proceeded via ST. Omer to Cassell the HQrs of 2nd Army. Here General Sir H. Plumer received the party, and from the roof of his HQrs building we saw a magnificent panorama, such an one as I have never before seen, covering the whole 360 degrees. He told them how well our 5th Div. had done in the recent attack. We then journeyed to La Motte via Hazebrouck, dined with Gen. Godley (New Zealand delegates also being present) then took Australian Party to Croix de Bac where billets had been arranged. Lord Burnham stayed with me and messed with my officers.\n\nFriday 21st July\n\nStarted out early. Called at Clearing Hospital where 2500 cases had been passed through during the last 2 nights. Inspected 9.2\", 60 pr. and 18 pr. Batteries, also Anti Aircraft Sections. Home to lunch. At 2.30 motored out to Kite Balloon Section. One of the delegates (Mr. Palmer) went up and thoroughly enjoyed his experience. Boche shelling Nieppe close at hand.\n\nMotored into Armentieres where we inspected the badly shelled Church, then on to the Aerodrome beyond La Gorgue, then home about 6.30. Quite a full day and I am sure the visitors were much interested. Witnessed burial of some of our Australian lads killed in the recent attack.\n\nSaturday 22nd July\n\nTook party to Boulogne via Hazebrouck and St. Omer. The district passed through is very beautiful. Lunched at Hotel Folkestone. Took Capt. Forrest with me. Saw party off about 4 PM by boat. Forrest went to Base at Etaples. I visited No. 13 General Hospital at Boulogne and conversed with some 60 or 70 wounded men, some from our own recent operation, and some from the Somme. Many pathetic cases. Then I roamed over the high cliff land overlooking Boulogne. Turned in about 11 PM\n\nSunday 23rd July\n\nLeft Boulogne about 10 AM Called at Wimmereux Hospital on the way to Calais. Saw Col. Eames, the C.O. who showed us around. Spoke to many Australians wounded in the recent operations.\n\nWent on through Calais to Dunkerque and Malo. Here we had lunch and purchased some post cards. Very fine beach. Came through Cassell and Poperingheto Ypres. This latter place is fascinating. It is a mass of ruins, the result of shell and fire. Particularly noticeable are the Cathedral and the Cloth Hall. Reached home at 7 PM. Wrote letters and attended to Office Correspondence. The 10th Brigade now attached to 5th Div, 11th Bde to N.Z. Div., 12th, 24th and DAC. in reserve.\n\nMonday 24th July\n\nVisited units during the afternoon, attended to correspondence in morning. Discussed with Gen. Gywnne the future utilisation of 4th Div Arty He informed me a definite sector would be allotted to us.\n\nTuesday 25th July\n\nWith Major Bates visited 2nd Anzac HQrs General Godley had returned the previous evening from Fricourt district and we heard of progress made. The 1st Aus Div now in and doing well in POZIERES WOOD. Discussed allotment of Artillery. Now decided to divide the Corps front into three Sectors as originally. We are allotted to the Centre Sector supporting two New Zealand Brigades. We shall have three Brigades in the line and one out. Col. Rabett and Col. Waite will be the first Group Commanders. Am ensuring my careful registrations being made and recorded for benefit of 3rd Division when it comes in.\n\nForwarded names of 10 NCOs and men recommended for Commissions. These are I understand to go to 3rd Division.\n\nCapt. Forrest attending Conference at 2nd Army HQrs re ammunitions. Lecture to B.Cs. and Brigade Commanders in our mess on points brought to notice during recent operations. Discussed with O.Cs., matter of promotions to 1st Lieut. Received my copy of Anzac book from London. Heavy Artillery fire north and south during night.\n","528":"\n\nBrigade Major spent the day in reconnoitring positions for our Brigades. I visited several of our wagon lines. Brigade Major lectured in the evening. Informed by Gen. Powell G.O.C.R.A. 2nd Anzac of proposals re going into line.\n","529":"\n\nReceived word from 2nd Anzac that though","530":" Div Arty would take over Centre Section of this area, we would not be supporting New Zealand Infantry, but would be attached to","531":" Div recently engaged on the Somme, who would be taking over Centre section. This is much more satisfactory from our point of view. We are to have four groups, so that each Brigade Commander will gain experience, also Brigade Staffs.\n\nI presume the new G.O.C. will take over the billets I now occupy, so have arranged to move into others. Brigade Major out on reconnaissance. Gen McCay wrote me, asking for statement from Col Waite re Col Pope, who is accused of being drunk during recent operations. Corps Ordnance Depot opened in our area, to whom we will apply direct for equipment.\n\nAsked to nominate an officer to go to the Somme to inspect gun positions. I propose sending Col. King.\n","532":"\n\nSent off 15 men under an officer as reinforcements to","533":" Div. T. Mortars (Medium) Batteries. Brigade Commanders reconnoitring their areas. Gen.

They are now to bring in their own Artillery and we are to move to Training Area, a little West of St. Omer. How soon this will eventuate remains to be seen, and also how\n\nlong we shall remain there if we do go. One cannot be sure of one’s movements for 12 hours at a time.\n\nBombardment down south very distinctly heard.\n","536":"\n\nLeft Croix de Bac at 6 AM, taking Benson with me. Went into Ypres. Benson made sketches of the Cloth hall and also of the Cathedral. While he was doing so I walked round and through the City. It is a mass of wonderful ruins, not a house having escaped the effects of shell or fire. Then went to Armentieres, where Benson made a sketch of Church of Notre Dame, which was badly shelled about a month since. During the afternoon Fleurbaix Church was shelled and set on fire. Some families were driven out of the town, and it was rather pathetic to see them trudging along the roads westwards with their remaining worldly effects in wagons. General Metcalf, CRA","537":" Div. called on me and discussed his taking over.\n","538":"\n\nWent with Capt. Forrest to look out Billets at Eecke. Went on to Cassell.

Forrest left Croix de Bac at 8 AM The","544":" and 12th Brigades had left earlier via Merville. I inspected them on the road. 12th Bde turn out particularly good. \n\nArrived at about 11 AM at Chateau we are to occupy at Lumbre as Head Qrs. Capt. Forrest completed billeting in detail. Very fine Chateau owned by a Viscount. He is about 50 years old and handed over the property for use of British Military officers. We shall be very comfortable here during our training period.\n\nLt Col Archdale R.H.A. who is to be our Camp Commandant called and stayed to dinner. Talked over details of training.\n\nPart or our HQrs. staff arrived here about 3 PM, balance coming by road with 24th Brigade.\n\nNice trout stream running beside this property. Our Brigade Major is an expert with the rod so we hope occasionally to have fish for our table.\n\nThursday 3rd August\n\nCapt. Forrest at 9 AM met Adjutants of 12th and 24th Brigades at Hallines, and pointed out their billets to them. After lunch I went with Capt. Forrest to Acquin where we arranged billets for D.A.C. Went on through Boisengham to training area, returning to Lumbre about 5 PM Major Bates went to see a R.A. Major at St. Omer, but he was not at home.\n\nThe 12th and 24th Brigades also Train settled into billets at Esquerdes and Setques. Secured good paddock for D.A.H.Q. horses. Country around Acquin is really beautiful – very hilly – fields a wonderful contrast in colours, real golden ripening wheat, sage Green oats, brilliant Green silver beet etc.\n\nFriday 4th August\n\nThe Anniversary of Declaration of War – Two dreadful years – how many more? Visited 12th and 24th Brigade battery billets. Major Bates on manoeuvre area. Capt. Forrest met Adjutants of 10th and 11th Brigades also D.A.C. at Wallen Cappelland arranged billets.\n\nAbout 40 reinforcements arrived from Etaples after having been travelling since Sunday last. Asked by 4th Aus Div to provide complete extra personnel for Heavy trench mortar battery. 3 officers, 66 other ranks, also instructed vacancies available for Artillery School at Tilques for 3 officers and 5 N.C.Os. Motored out to training area. The 10th and 11th Bdes also DAC. commenced march from Croix de Bac.\n\nSaturday 5th August\n\nMajor Bates rode out with me to manoeuvre area. Saw 24th and 12th Brigades at work. Came back at midday. Watched 10th, 11th Bdes and D.A.C. march into this area. Packing of vehicles of 11th Brigade not good – nor march discipline.\n\nShall have to be very persistent during the period of training to ensure a good standard.\n\nSunday 6th August\n\nAnniversary of Lone Pine action Gallipoli. Brigade Major and myself motored to Etaples to discuss matters at Base regarding reinforcements. Saw Capt. Clayton O.C. and lunched with him. Saw O.C. Reinforcements and D.A.D.R.T. They neither knew our correct rail head, so in consequence our reinforcements have first been sent to 4th Aus. Div on the Somme.\n\nCalled on Major Short of 1st Div. Training Depot. Called at St. JOHNS Hospital and conversed with several wounded officers.\n\nTook interesting route home, by sundry side roads and lanes. Received instructions to send four officers to England for course of training. Col. Griffiths wrote me re Halford and sent copies of letters he had forwarded to 3rd Aus Div and A.I.F. HQrs. in England. I think these will overcome all difficulties.\n\nMonday 7th August\n\nOut all day with batteries of 24th Brigade. Elementary work taking up positions. Major Edwards’ battery did very well. Generally a bit \"sticky\". Work criticised by Colonel and Camp Commandant.\n\nTuesday 8th August\n\nOut all day with 12th Brigade. Lt. McCay did very well indeed. Similar scheme to that of yesterday.\n\nMany points brought out and drawn attention to. Went into St. Omer in the evening. Very fine town.

(Major Lindemann) to assist farmers to get in harvest.\n\nHave offered 500 men and 40 wagons.\n\nWednesday 9th August\n\nThe 10th Brigade at work on training area with same scheme as above. Batteries did very well generally, but many mistakes had to be corrected. Should see a wonderful improvement before we leave this district. Every day as crops are reaped we shall have a more extended area to work over.\n","545":"\n\nThe 11th Brigade out today. Turn out not as good as other Brigades, the 12th being easily the best. More attention must be paid to detail. Work of batteries generally very fair, perhaps Capt. Hodgson the best. Lieut. Irving feels the Battery work rather heavy and desires transfer to D.A.C. Apparently he has been broken up a good deal by horses in his day and is not quite up to the fatigue consequent on continuous battery work.\n","546":"\n\nVisited Canadian Corps, thence on to C.R.A. of 2nd Canadian Division whose front we are now ordered to take over. Went on to two of their groups (Col. King’s and Col. Stewart’s) and made an inspection of Gun positions and OPs. Our front will be about 3000 yards, with the St. Eloi craters as a centre.

They have been touring France, Spain and Scotland.\n\nMonday 14th August\n\nCalled at A.I.F. Head Quarters and reported myself. Had a long interview with Col. Anderson also Col. Griffiths who happened to be in London for one day. I ascertained that George Halford had reported to A.I.F. HQrs. and had been sent to Salisbury Plain, so I presume all difficulties in his direction are now overcome.\n\nCalled on Miss Coulishaw and Dr. and Mrs. Paul, also Admiralty re position of Charley’s ship. Met a Major Roxborough and his wife at Whitehall also her father (a Presbyterian Clergyman) and his wife.\n\nMajor Roxborough is the officer who was temporarily in command at Portabella Barracks, Dublin, during the recent Sinn Fein riots, and is under a cloud at the War office.

An exceedingly pretty run. Caught Ruth and Mrs. Halford finishing lunch. Stayed the afternoon and then brought them back in the car. Spent the evening at Merton Road, the whole family being there. Harrogate famous for its mineral springs is a fine town beautifully situated and as we passed through appeared thronged with fashionable folk.\n\nFriday 18th August\n\nLeft Bradford at 9 AM and reached London at 1.30. Took Dr. Paul, Alice and Miss Cowlishaw to dinner at the \"Rendezvous\", then to see \"Hobsons Choice\" which proved a very entertaining show.\n\nSaturday 19th August\n\nLeft London at 1 o’clock. Capt. Forrest returned in the same train. I was O.C. Troops on the journey to Boulogne, where we arrived at 5.30. Our car was waiting and we reached home at 7 PM, having thoroughly enjoyed the short leave. Found many letters awaiting me, also papers.\n\nSunday 20th August\n\nBrigade Major and myself visited the Canadian Sector. Called at Corps HQrs., thence to HQrs. of 2nd Canadian Division.

Col. Rabett and his Adjutant to lunch. I am informed Rabett is now the proud father of a son. Went into St. Omer during the afternoon re car supplies. Rabett went with me. Looked over the Abbey ruins and the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Both are very fine and well worth visiting. The former is a monument to the terrible doings of the\n\nFrench revolution. Purchased some stores at officers Canteen. All Colonels of Divisional Artillery dined at my Head Quarters. The Brigade Major’s gramophone livened us up afterwards. Saw them home in the car. Lt. Harlock temporarily appointed A.D.C.\n\nTuesday 22nd August\n\nCol. Hughes and Waite (Group Commanders) and all Battery Commanders moved to 2nd Canadian Division Area. The former came with me in the car, the remainder by motor bus. ADC and myself went round all gun positions in the area to be held by 4th Aus Div Artillery, and also intended to look at some O.P.s but the Boche appeared to follow us up with 5.9\" shells so we abandoned this part of the Programme. A few fragments fell uncomfortably close to us, so we decided to take no unnecessary risks. Returned to Lumbres at 5 PM.\n\nWednesday 23rd August\n\nBrigade Major left for Reningheldst.

Snow falling when I returned to my Hotel.\n\nSaturday 18th November\n\nLeft for Amiens at 9.30. Reached there at noon. Bates to meet me with car. Called at 4th Army HQrs. and saw General Budworth MGRA, also Maps officer, then on to Corps where I had an interview with Gen. Hobbs and a long confidential talk with Gen. White. He confirmed my previous information that we are to be here for the winter.\n\nCame on to Divisional Head Quarters and \"turned in\" early. I forgot to note that the country from Paristo Amiens looked particularly beautiful this morning under a heavy mantel of snow. Bitterly cold.\n\nSunday 19th November\n\nCommenced out at 9 AM to look round all Battery positions of 2nd Aus Div which we have to take over. I rode up through MONTAUBAN, Bernafay Wood, Longueval and Delville Wood. Leaving the horses at the latter point I walked on to Brigade HQrs. and Battery Positions. Delville Wood full of Heavy Howrs. and guns. Battery positions very miserable indeed. Our men will have plenty to do to get them secure and comfortable. The forward Brigade is close to Flers, with one Battery among the ruins. These latter batteries are about 2500 yards from Boche front line.\n\nFlers is a wonderful example of the horrors of modern war.\n\nBuildings and roads shattered, broken vehicles, dead men, horses and mules in the streets and among the ruins. A true picture of desolation. Artillery on both sides sending out missiles of destruction, roads knee deep in mud, and the weather bitterly cold. Our men are having a dreadful experience.\n\nMy battery commanders come in tomorrow. Col. Robertson is to command 12th Inf. Bde., and Gen. Holmes is to command the Division when Gen. Cox leaves at the end of the year. \n\nToday I also looked round battery positions of 1st Aus Div Their 18 prs. practically in one long line. Not too satisfactorily placed I imagine.\n\nMonday 20th November.\n\nStayed in all day. Worked out map schemes. Gen. White late CRA here departed. Gen. Johnstone reconnoitring his new area. The 1st and 4th Divisions are to work together, also 2nd and","619":" ditto. Brigade and battery commanders came in to the line. Relief to be completed by 8 AM","620":" inst. Capt. Fox came in. His men uncomfortable at BELLEVUE farm so he arranged with Town Mayor of Albert for billets for his men. I have decided to have two groups only, one at Flers, and the other some 600 yards south of Flers. One Colonel will be with his Brigade in rest, and the other is to be O.C. wagon lines. I shall put King and Waite in first.\n\nWe shall, I can see, have a very strenuous and miserable time here in the winter. Both men and horses will need very close attention to keep them fit. Heavy shelling during the night, and aeroplanes dropping bombs, two in close proximity to our Head Quarters.\n","621":"\n\nWith General Johnstone went through all schemes, everything now ready for taking over. Gen. Johnstone inspecting his new zone. The 1st British Division is on our left, with Gen. Cartwright still CRA, and Col. Dobbin now GSO I in place of Col. Longridge who was killed here recently. Rovey Dougall still R.A. Brigade Major. Gen. Holland the Divisional Commander is now MGRA 3rd Army.\n","622":"\n\nA wet miserable day. Went round portion of the front,. Hope to make arrangements for all ammunitions to be supplied by train and thus save our teams.\n\nThursday 23rd November\n\nHalf our batteries took over from 2nd Aus Div Conditions appalling, especially at wagon lines. Halford to Abbeville re Canteen stores.\n\nFriday 24th November\n\nBalance of Batteries and DAC took over from 2nd Aus. Division. Relief completed at 3 PM at which time I took over command of 1st and","623":" Aus Div Artillery and responsibility for the front. Went to Amiens in the morning to get measured for a pair of breeches. Discussed with Gen. Hobbs re training Camps. He wants to send an extra Colonel back, much against my will.\n","624":"\n\nSpent the whole day riding round the front positions. Teeming rain, got sopping wet – really wet through. Arranged with Col. Fewtrell re service of trains for ammunition supply. Conference with Cols. King and Waite at Flers, regarding position of HQrs., batteries etc. Got back at 3 PM. Gen. Johnston left this HQrs. and moved to Bernafay Wood. Our own mess took over from last night.\n","625":"\n\nConference with Gen. Hobbs re Training School. Much against my wishes it has been decided to take a Colonel for School Commandant in addition to the O.C. the Brigade in rest. In future therefore I shall send individual batteries of Brigades to rest instead of actual Brigades.\n\nMiserably wet and cold day. Wrote letters.\n","626":"\n\nWith Col. Fewtrel, Vernon, King and Waite made a reconnaissance for train routes to supply batteries with ammunition. Satisfactory arrangements made. Personnel of H.T.M. Battery will be divided between Nos. 3 and 4 groups for the construction of these connecting lines, and also to build new Howitzer positions, each for 6 Howrs., with dug outs complete at about 30 feet depth. Returned to HQrs. about 3 PM. With Vernon inspected Rail Head Ammunition depot and quarry. Made arrangements for certain improvements. Lamed Jack during my peregrinations so had to walk home. Roads in dreadful condition.\n","627":"\n\nRemained in Camp all day. Attended to Office, the Brigade Major going round the Groups. Completed arrangements and syllabus for artillery School at Naours. Arranged with Col. Rabett to take over as Commandant. Got him in here during the afternoon and in the evening completed all details. Heard of casualties to DAC salvage party the information being that 5 men are killed, 15 wounded and 15 mules killed. Correct details not yet available. Arranged with Vernon re salving ammunition. Extremely cold night.\n","628":" \n\nReceived full particulars regarding DAC casualties of yesterday. Four men killed, 8 wounded (four seriously), 24 mules killed and 4 horses. One of the mules kicked a \"dud\" shell with the above results. Rabett went off to Naours. Desperately cold day and night.\n","629":"\n\nIn the morning rode out to Bazentin, our proposed new Head Quarters. Intensely cold day. Lt. Col. came in during the afternoon with his batman, prior to going to Naours. Did a good deal of writing during the afternoon.\n","630":"\n\nIn early morning went out to Naours re School. Called at Albert, saw HQrs. billets and stables. They are fairly comfortable. Called at Army HQrs. Querrieu, to see DD of S & T re Claxton Horn for car. Found his office some distance out of the village. Lt. Col. accompanied me. Reached Naours a little after noon. With Col. Rabett had a look at Hall, School, Chateau etc., in relation to use for lecture purposes. Had lunch at 41st Battery HQrs. Found nothing had been done by Corps in anticipation of School; so on my way back I called at Corps and strafed everybody concerned. Came through Amiens on the way to Heilly. Had afternoon tea with General Hobbs. Road near Pommier Redoubt triple banked by British How. Batteries. Road and traffic blocked for an hour.\n\nThe coldest day and night we have yet experienced. Boche strafing with Heavy Artillery.\n","631":"\n\nInterviewed Engineer Corporal at Gen. Birdwood’s request re proposed new design for Fuze.\n\nGen. Hobbs called at 10 AM and together we rode to Delville Wood where we left our horses. Then walked towards Brigade HQrs. but as shelling was going on in the vicinity we skirted Delville Wood to the N.E. and thoroughly inspected a tank in the vicinity. They are very ingeniously designed. Here are plenty of evidences of the heavy fighting which took place – plenty of German F.A. ammunition lying about indicating hasty retreat, also arms and equipment of all kinds, British as well as Boche. Very many dead still lying unburied.\n\nWe inspected several batteries and went into Flers, passing one of our own wrecked aeroplanes as we went.\n\nA bitterly cold day – much below zero; and for the last three days and nights the temperature has been much below freezing point. Received very nice letter from Nell. Rather a serious matter occurred to day. We had prepared a nice Artillery Scheme for a proposed operation in taking a certain trench. An Infantry Brigadier and a Battalion Commander were so indiscreet as to allow the document to be carried up to the front line by a runner for the information of a \n\nCompany Commander. He lost his way – got into the Boche trenches and with the orders and Artillery programme was captured.\n\nIn consequence the operation is \"off\" and Gen. Cox is highly incensed, as well he might be. An enquiry is to be held tomorrow.\n","632":"\n\nWrote letters all day. Cleared off all correspondence. Enquiry held re yesterday’s episode. The Battalion Commander, Col. Dare, has been relieved of his Command and returned to A.I.F. HQrs. London. Very sorry for him, but in my opinion the Infantry Brigadier was most to blame. Boche artillery very active. Gen. Cox and Col. Bernard dined with us. The former will soon be leaving us. My Brigade Major had just received some grouse from England, so we had an enjoyable dinner.\n\nMonday 4th December\n\nHad Colonel Vernon to see me re DAC salvage work. Not running too smoothly with 1st DAC Complaints from Infantry regarding short shooting. Found one 1st Div. 18 pr. shell had fallen in our lines. Shell a \"dud\" and identity yet to be established. Enemy artillery very active during day and on our flanks he was especially busy during the nights.\n\nAgain a very cold night.\n","633":"\n\nA bitterly cold day. I was out riding during the morning and for the space of an hour the driving rain, sleet and hail was very biting. Conference at Bernafay Wood with General Budworth MGRA","634":" Army. All CRAs. present (excepting Gen. Hobbs) and 7 group Commanders. He drew attention to points concerning training, ammunition, construction, Boche killing etc. and asked us all to do our best to have the best possible trained Artillery for the offensive operation when launched. I walked to the Conference and back again, about 6 miles of muddy road, but I was glad to get my feet warm.\n","635":"\n\nStayed in all day, worked on maps and Artillery Schemes. Received two parcels from Nell,\n\none of socks, and the other of handkerchiefs and ties, all very useful. Also received two letters from Alvord and one from Chris.\n","636":"\n\nLeft HQrs. at 8 AM. Rode to Delville Wood. Sent Bligh back with the horses. Walked on through 37th and 39th Batteries. Saw Col. King at his Head Quarters, then walked on to 38th Battery at Flers. Work progressing satisfactorily on gun emplacements. Inspected site for 110th Battery. Found what appears to be a splendid deep \"dugout\", possibly a Bde H Qrs. judging by the number of Boche telephone lines leading to it. Getting this cleaned out for use of 110th Battery. Walked on to 112th, 38th, 44th and 40th Batteries. Heavily shelled during last night; one pit hit and four men casualties. Two men of 24th Bde H Qrs. also caught by shell in front of their telephone office. Lunched with Col. Waite. His battery deep dugouts well under weigh. With Col. Waite inspected his forward gun positions towards Factory Corner and then made a reconnaissance of country for future gun positions. Found one apparently suitable place for a 6 How. Batty. with German gunner dugouts already constructed. Came back through 112th present battery position. Called on Gen. Walker who today took over from General Cox. He has just received Corps instructions to the effect that the Division holding the line will have its own CRA, so from 11 AM tomorrow I hand over. This will give me more time to attend to School at Naours, also to keep in touch with batteries in the line, and arrange a new Camping area for wagon lines etc.\n","637":"\n\nUnder orders issued from Corps the CRA of the Division actually holding the line is now to control the Artillery, so at 11 AM today I handed over to 1st Aus. Div Arty General Hobbs here during morning. Discussed details re Artillery Schools, and Artillery work in the Front line. School arrangements have been beautifully bungled by Corps. No attempt has been made to provide necessary accommodation. In consequence the Division has now been asked to take the matter in hand.\n","638":"\n\nMajor Bates and myself thoroughly reconnoitred ground in front of Flers almost up to Guedecourt. Some guns of 1st Division very badly placed – in my opinion they should be withdrawn. Two German field guns have been lying close to these batteries for some weeks, yet have not been salved. Cannot understand it. Carefully examined Flers, also position for 110th Battery and 38th Battery. The latter doing good work in his position, and will have splendid emplacements. Good cellars being located, among them one used as an electric light Station by the Boche with all its plant intact and a dozen dead Boche inside. Lunched with Capt. de Low. Forrest and Halford at Naours. Matters still very unsatisfactory re School. Col. Bernard also there to day.\n","639":"\n\nWith Bates went to School at Naours. A chapter of accidents – three punctures. Called at Div HQrs re syllabus. Rabett doing well at School, but still difficulty re materials. Engineer officer present who is now making arrangements for what is required. Gen. Rabett grant of £10 for mess requirements.\n","640":"\n\nEarly this morning (at 1.45) I was awakened by bombs dropping in the vicinity of our camp, three falling uncomfortably close. At once our \"Archies\" opened fire, the search lights commenced to play and pandemonium reigned for some time. I heard a number of explosions in the vicinity of Amiens – about 50 – and conclude the Boche was bombing the City. One plane kept circling around us at a low altitude and loosing off machine guns directed along the roads. It was a beautifully clear moonlight night with a heavy frost. This morning I made a further reconnaissance of Left Group Zone. Arranged with Col. Waite re position of Edward’s How. Battery, then inspected O.P. position in front of Flers, then on to Guedecourt. I had an orderly from 10th Brigade with me and together we flitted from shell hole to shell hole till we reached the battered remains of Guedecourt. This place offers splendid facilities for observation. Shelling\n\nall around very persistent, luckily nothing in Guedecourt while I was there, but commenced soon after I left. Much aerial activity this morning, the day being very clear and bright. About lunch time it became overcast and later rained. Got home at 5 PM very tired and wet.\n","641":"\n\nStayed in all day. Worked on plans and wrote letters. Fine fall of snow.\n","642":"\n\nIn early morning went out to Front. Inspected 45th and 46th Batteries. With Capt. Ellis went through Flers and pointed out to him proposed O.P.; then on through Grove Alley to front line or within a few yards of it. The Boche rigorously shelling the front line trench. At Junction of Grove Alley we waited for ¾ of an hour. As however shelling continued I decided to return. Got a splendid view of the country. Condition of trenches indescribable. In many cases well up to the thighs in sticky mud. On one occasion I got stuck and it took me 10 minutes to pull myself out. Capt. Ellis also got stuck but could not extricate himself till he withdrew his feet from his boots, the latter remaining stuck in the mud. He walked a few yards in his socks and these too were left stuck, so he came back some 300 yards to a Field Ambulance barefooted and there received a pair of gum boots. I was exceedingly tired when I got home. Bates, Fox and Halford out at Naours and T.M. School. Bates staying there a couple of days. T.M. School not satisfactory. Firing must be arranged for. Got breeches from Amiens. Issued with pair of brown Field Boots.\n\nThursday 14th December\n\nWent out this morning with Col. Vernon to look at site allotted for wagon lines for DA at Buire.\n\nCalled on Dados at Albert, Div HQrs at Rubimont, and Corps at Heilly. Gen. White strafed a little re School at Naours. Came on to Buire. Areas are not consolidated but generally are well chosen. Watering arrangements good. Hope to get \n\na start at once sending horses back. Reached HQrs. at 3.30 and while we were having a late lunch the Boche commenced shelling our HQrs. The first one fell about 20 yards from our Mess and scattered lumps of mud over the canvas roof. About 15 in all were sent over. No damage done I am informed. Gen. Hobbs is appointed temporarily to command 5th Aus Div owing to illness of Gen. McCay.\n\nFriday 15th December\n\nWent out to Naours during morning. Called at Albert, picked up boxes for Col. Rabett and mails for our HQrs. Took new road to Naours – not very good.

Will complete reconnaissance tomorrow morning.\n\nWednesday 20th December\n\nWent out early with D.T.M.O. to reconnoitre Right Flank in vicinity of Guedecourt. Motored to Bernafay Wood and then walked. When a little to the East of Guedecourt the Boche commenced to shell it rather heavily, and a fragment from one shell caught me in the right thigh inflicting a rather nasty flesh wound. Nothing serious. I applied a field dressing, completed reconnaissance then walked back, leg giving some trouble. Called at 14th Field Ambulance, Bernafay Wood and had wound dressed by Major Sawers. A remarkable set of circumstances circles around this officer. He dressed my wounds on the \"Gloucester Castle\" in May 1915, the first time I was wounded at Gallipoli, later saw him in No. 17 Hospital Alexandria when I was ill with enteric in September 1915, saw him again at Wandsworth Hospital, London in","648":" and now here again.

Spent our last night at Bavelincourt Chateau.\n\nTuesday 3rd April\n\nWatched 11th Brigade move out on its march. Here too march discipline was reasonably good. Major Bates and self came on to Baupaume in the car with our new Chaffeur, Staton having been ordered to rejoin his unit, Imperial ASC The new man is unused to a \"Daimler\" and we had a very unpleasant journey forward.\n\nCalled at Divisional HQrs. and saw Gens. Holmes and Johnstone. Then went on to \"A\" Echelon D.A.C. where we are staying till I officially take over the Artillery of the Left Sector, Anzac Corps. The 10th Brigade arrived.\n","742":"\n\nA very wet miserable day. Major Bates and myself made a reconnaissance of the Longatte Valley, also Norieul Valley. Col. King and Major Edwards with their Battery Commanders, also Col. Rabett made a reconnaissance of the above two Valleys and Lagnicourt Valley handing in their reports in the evening.\n\nIn yesterday’s notes I omitted to refer to a brilliant performance of a German Aviator during the afternoon. Two of our Kite Balloons were in position when suddenly a Boche plane came along at a terrific speed, fired at on all sides by \"Archies\" and machine guns. He reached the first balloon, and fired his incendiary bullets. The balloon at once burst into flames, and simultaneously the two observer occupants in the basket\n\nmade a parachute descent, the falling burning balloon several times appearing to envelope them. However they reached the ground safely. The occupants of the basket of the second balloon seeing what had happened, lost no time in also making parachute descents which were successful. In the meantime the plane had reached this balloon and treated it in a similar manner to the first. It also fell in flames. This all happened within 300 yards of Divisional Head Quarters, and the whole staff from the Divisional Commander downwards watched the combat with bated breath. All this time the plane was being shot at from all directions, but its work being done it returned over our lines flying very low, and apparently without serious injury. The whole episode took no more than 5 to 10 minutes, but was enthralling, and I so much admired the pluck and fearlessness of the aviator that I could not help being pleased that he got off safely. The 11th Brigade arrived, mechanically drawn.\n\nThursday 5th April\n\nAt 11 AM today I officially took over Command of Artillery Left Sector, 1st Anzac Corps from Gen. Johnstone, CRA 2nd Aus Div When all Artillery allotted is in position I shall have 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisional Artillerys also 12th Army Brigade in all 162 guns and howitzers. During the afternoon with Col. Rabett I called at Col. Lloyd’s HQrs. and explained to him the new regrouping arrangements.\n\nSaw Gen. Uwaike and Major Broad at Div HQrs also Generals Birdwood and White. Col. King and group and Battery Commanders of 4th ADA made a further reconnaissance of their proposed positions.\n\nIncensed to find that 2nd ADA batteries and groups are still using earth return wires in spite of definite orders to the contrary.\n\nFriday 6th April\n\nConference with Divisional Commander and Infantry Brigadiers at 10 AM re forthcoming operation. At 12 noon at rear of Longatte \n\nI met Gen. Anderson, CRA 62nd Division, and arranged re location of our interloping batteries, and also gunner boundary between us. Col. King accompanied me. Col. King moved his batteries into the line during the night and 2nd Aus Div and 12th Army Brigade moved their batteries to new positions. \"Good Friday\".\n\nSaturday 7th April\n\nStayed in during the morning. At 1 PM I met the Army Commander General Gough near Vraucourt, and explained to him my Artillery disposition. He had Colonel Tandy with him from G.H.Q. Afterwards we walked on to the spur between Noreiul and Longatte and had a good look at the enemy’s lines. Weather much improved. Lieuts. Rundle and Bellamy badly wounded today, also a number of gunners wounded and one killed. The 2nd Brigade 1st Aust. Div. Artillery moved into action tonight behind Longatte. Gen. Godley visited us.\n\nSunday 8th April\n\nWith Capt. Forrest reconnoitred positions for D.A.C. of 1st, 2nd and 4th Aus. Divs. Col. Vernon reported from D.A.C. X29d, and is tomorrow bringing up his \"B\" Echelon. Charming day. Still no definite details regarding projected operations. The 1st Brigade 1st Aus Div Artillery moved into action tonight also behind Longatte. All Artillery now in the line. A solid 10 minutes strafe from all guns commenced today at 3 PM Very little retaliation. Suggested proposal to go through Hindenburg Line between Bullecourt and Quenit Salient. Tanks to the number of 4 to cooperate. Big show at Arras \n\ncommences tomorrow morning.\n\nMonday 9th April\n\nAt 6 AM in blinding rain and sleet I rode off to look round all Battery positions in Left Anzac Sector. Watched the bombardment at Arras some 12 miles distant. A unique sight. It looked just like a low wall of irregular flame for some miles, with smoke rising from it. Some 2000 guns are in action at this point. Rode round all battery positions, also to country near Ecoust spur south of Longatte, Noreuil and Lagnicourt. Our gunners having a thin time. Bitterly cold, heavy work and many casualties. Generals Birdwood, Anderson and Sir Neville House lunched with us. Gen. Anderson promised to write Nell when he returns to Australia next month. In afternoon attended Conference with Gen. Fraser at Heavy Artillery Head Quarters Avesgne, afterwards came on to Division where orders had been received to attack to night under cover of 12 tanks, or rather at 4.30 AM tomorrow. Great rush to get out necessary orders to groups for allotment of tasks to Batteries. Heavy Artillery shelling Riencourt and Bullecourt all night.\n\nTuesday 10th April\n\nArras show proved very successful yesterday. A splendid advance has been made and three lines of defence pierced. Some 6000 prisoners have been taken and 30 guns. Cavalry of three Divisions now hope to get through. A day or two since a great aerial battle took place near Cambrai. A large number of our planes went out on a bombing expedition and were attacked by Boche machine, they losing 46 planes while we lost 26. Operations this morning postponed, the tanks not having reached their starting point on time owing to their having lost their way during a heavy snow storm in the night. Solid artillery work went on all day yesterday. The 1st Aus Div captured Hermies, Demicourt and Boursies.\n\nWednesday 11th April\n\nEarly this morning (4.30 AM) the 12th and 4th Infantry Brigades attacked the Hindenburg Line between Bullecourt and Queant supported by 12 tanks. These latter were discovered by the enemy just as the advance commenced, and six were put out of action. The Infantry got into the enemy’s trenches and a large number of our men pushed on to Riencourt and later, following two tanks, went into Hendicourt. Meanwhile the 62nd Division on our left which was to attack Bullecourt was waiting for its allotment of tanks to come to their flank after helping our Division. Only one got to Bullecourt and was there made a derelict. The Infantry (4th Aus Div) were having a thin time in the trenches owing to the difficulty of getting up supplies of bombs etc. Our Artillery was ordered not to barrage Eastern edge of Bullecourt because of Tank operations, and these latter being held up, the enemy was able to use his machine guns against our carrying parties. Finally the enemy bombed our Infantry out of the trenches and forced them to retire on their original line. Though the Brigadier 4th Infantry Brigade affirmed none of his troops advanced to Riencourt and Hendecourt our Artillery observers everywhere reported such to be the case, and confirmation came in later for an aeroplane observer who had seen 300 of our men being marched along the road north East from Cagnicourt under escort. He came down low and machine gunned the escort causing many casualties. This observer also reported seeing a tank, evidently captive, moving along road north from Hendecourt. The whole operation was a costly one, casualties passing through field Ambulances by evening totalling 32 officers and 1065 other ranks. This inclusive of our men\n\ntaken prisoners, wounded and dead in enemy’s hands\n\nThe 4th Aus Div is being withdrawn from the line and the 2nd Aus Div is coming in. I understand I am to remain as CRA of the massed Divisional Artilleries. Good news from the Arras sector. So far 11,000 prisoners have been taken and 103 guns, while a good advance has been made into the enemy’s country.\n\nThursday 12th April\n\nIt has been decided to again attack the Hindenburg Line, this time under an Artillery barrage, to take place on Sunday next. An elaborate scheme is being worked out. In order to get best results I am pushing more batteries forward, and with this object met Col. Rabett at his HQrs. and also Col. King at his. As a result each group is pushing forward one 18 pr. and one How. battery into Noreuil and Longatte. Very wet and cold miserable day. During last night heavy snow fell, and I felt very sorry for the unfortunate wounded still lying out and where it was unable to reach. Forces on the north captured Green Line without much opposition and are advancing on Fontaine Les Croisilles and Cherisy.\n\nFriday 13th April\n\nThe 2nd Aus. Division was to have taken over this sector today but move has been postponed till midday tomorrow. Troops on the north have now captured 15,900 prisoners and 203 guns, besides about 270 machine guns and 69 trench mortars. Barrage scheme (advance copy) received from Gocra. A copy sent out to each group for early information. A total of 48,000 rounds will be required, about 550 tons and will need some strenuous night work to finish.\n\nArmy Commander visited D.H.Q. Special message sent to 4th Aus Div by C in C and Army Commander. Another attack is to take place at an early date by 2nd Aus Div and 62nd Division. Train knocked out at Baupaume.\n\nSaturday 14th April\n\nThe 4th Aus Div to day handed over to 2nd Aus Div and General Holmes and staff left about midday. Discussed details of forthcoming attack with Gen. Smythe, and showed him Barrage map just received from Gocra. Gen. White called and discussed Artillery programme with me. Arranged with him to supply 600 rounds at the guns and all echelons filled.\n\nSunday 15th April\n\nThis morning at 4.48 I received word from Col. Stephenson commanding \"19\" group that 1st Div. Infantry covering Lagnicourt were falling back through his gun positions, before strong bodies of Boche, and that he expected to have to abandon his guns. I instructed him to hold on as long as possible with 1st Brigade and cover 2nd Brigade, also if forced to retire to remove breech blocks and sights and all orders re forthcoming operations. Infantry (enemy) pushed forward to road in which Col. Stephenson’s HQrs. were placed, overrunning our guns. In the meantime the 2nd Aus Div had brought up 2 battalions from Vaux and prevented the Boche advancing further. The line \nheld\n of the Division was held and a protecting flank thrown back to Noreuil. Heavy fighting took place. We barraged Lagnicourt with 18 prs. and Heavy artillery and continued to the front of Noreuil. In the meantime the position of \"Q\" group was distinctly critical and I ordered up the teams in anticipation of enforced withdrawal. A similar order given to \"P\" group. The Infantry from Vaux and Noreuil now began to make themselves felt and commenced to envelope the enemy who thereupon attempted to retire. Immediately information was first received from Col. Stephenson as to enemy covering through Lagnicourt I ordered \"P\" Group to put up a barrage East of the Village, and also got the Heavy Artillery to do the same. Hence large number of Boche were killed. \n\nLater I arranged for similar barrage in front of Lagnicourt (West side) which undoubtedly prevented the enemy from destroying all the guns. In the enemy retirement artillery of \"Q\" group successfully engaged large numbers at 1500 yards range. About 300 prisoners remain in our hands, and casualties killed are estimated at 2,000, including those killed on front covered by 1st Aus Div which was also attacked. The guns of the first and second Brigades 1st Aus. Div Arty all had gun cotton charges in them when recovered. Plenty of gun cotton charges were lying about denoting hurried retreat. During the afternoon I visited Col. Stephenson and his batteries, and also went on to the spur north East of Lagnicourt. In one small area about 200 yards square I counted 65 dead Boche, many sadly mutilated by shell fire and dismembered. A tragic struggle evidently took place on the sunken road entering Lagnicourt from the East. Here 1 Australian lay dead and around him 12 dead Boche four of whom had been bayoneted, evidently as they tried to rush the post. In the Noreuil Valley hundreds lay dead, and many wounded being brought in.\n\nWhile the attack was in progress Ecoust and Longatte were subject to a heavy barrage, and plenty of 5.9\" shell. The batteries of \"P\" group had a very thin time indeed and suffered heavily, especially the 43rd which had its Battery commander and a Subaltern killed (Major Pybus and Lt. Clarke) 10 men killed and many wounded including 2 officers. Others were badly shell shocked. Lt. Rundle wounded a few days since died as a result of an abdominal wound. I shall be very glad when the proposed operations really eventuate. The only three valleys possible for placing of guns are continuously shelled, and casualties in personnel and guns are already abnormally heavy. A battalion is tonight posted in front of Lagnicourt and arrangements have been made for a platoon with a Lewis gun to be attached to each Artillery Brigade as an Escort.\n\nMany of the Boche dead and wounded are boys of 18 or 19. The attack along the Corps front was made with 18 Battalions.\n\nMonday 16th April\n\nThis morning I attended the funeral of Major Pybus and Lt. Clarke. They were buried in the Baupaume Cemetery. Coffins being unavailable they were shrouded in their blankets and their Artillery colours sewn on thereto. I tried to say a few words to the officers and men present regarding the service and qualifications of the deceased officers. I am afraid I made a very poor showing for I certainly spoke from a full heart.\n\nThe DAC made all the funeral arrangements including provision of a firing party and trumpeters who sounded the \"Last Post\".\n\nThe Boche, in order to make room for his own dead, has exhumed many French bodies, and fragments of bone and coffins are left, lying about in a scandalous manner. In this Cemetery is a fine monument erected by the French to the memory of the soldiers who fell at Baupaume in the \"70\" war. The boche has erected beside it a large stone monument to the memory of his men who fell in the vicinity of Baupaume in 1915 and 1916. Whether the French will remove this or not remains to be seen.\n\nGen. Johnstone today held an enquiry into the details of abandonment of guns of 1st Aus Div Artillery during the Boche attack a few nights since.\n\nLt. Col. Shellshear is to report to me tomorrow from 3rd Aus Div Artillery to take over command of 4th Brigade","743":" Aus Div Arty, vice Col. Watts killed in action.\n\nGen. Carruthers here re ammunition railheads and supply to guns. New Chaffeur arrived. \n","744":"\n\nDiscussed barrage plans for forthcoming operations with Gen. Smythe, also arranged to get copy from 62nd Division of their barrage, and make a complete map, showing tasks for Heavy Artillery as well as for Field Artillery. Final orders issued to all Groups re moves of Brigades when final objective has been gained.\n\nBitterly cold weather. More sleet and snow. Lt. Col. Shellshear arrived and instructed to report to \"Q\" group. Two men of 47th Battalion","745":" Aus Div who were in the operation of","746":" inst. returned to our lines last night. They had been with two others in a shell hole in the Boche wire luckily in a portion which we were not shelling. The two others had been killed by shell fire. They are giving a great deal of useful information. Naturally they were very exhausted from want of food and exposure to the wet and cold weather experienced since the day of attack.\n","747":"\n\nQuite a good Australian mail in today. Two letters from Nell, two from Alvord, one from Chris and one from Charley. His exams are just about commencing and he seems satisfied that he will get through satisfactorily. Obtained Barrage map from 62nd Division, Halford instructed to prepare a combined barrage map. Halford provided","748":" Lieutenant. Officers for Artillery Signal Sections arrived. These are now being organised. Very wet miserable day so I did not go out to the front line. French and Boche having a bitter fight between Soissons and Rheims. The French have captured over 11,000 prisoners and all front line systems. Despite many and heavy counter attacks in which reserve German Divisions have been employed, the French have held on to all the gains. British in the edge of St. Quentin also Lens.\n","749":"\n\nMiserable wet and cold day. Stayed in office. Worked out Barrage maps. Army Commanders called during afternoon. Informed us our operations still further delayed till","750":" instant. Arranged with General White that batteries should be withdrawn leaving only one Brigade in the line in each Artillery group. Thus a chance will be given to some of the Batteries for a rest and clean up. All the personnel have had a very thin time indeed, working night and day with very little sleep, and suffering many casualties.\n","751":"\n\nFor a change the sun shone out to day. I rode out to Col. King’s Head Quarters at 9.30 AM, left my horse there, and with Major Williams walked round some of the Battery positions, into Ecoust and Longatte, also to Railway embankments North East of Ecoust, thence via sunken road to Norueil, and then back to Colonel King’s Head Quarters. From OPs. of 37th and 39th Batteries in Longatte I had an excellent view of the whole country over which our attack is to take place. When I returned to DHQ. I learned that Gen. Johnstone, CRA 2nd Aus Div is to take over Artillery Command tomorrow at noon. Attended a conference at 2.30 with Divisional Commander concerning forthcoming operations which are now to take place on the early morning of 27th inst. Back axle of car broken when returning from overhaul.\n","752":"\n\nDuring the morning I made all arrangements for handing over to General Johnstone which was done at 12 noon. Major Bates is remaining on as Brigade Major till proposed operations have been carried out. Office moved into temporary quarters, and small camp pitched for ourselves opposite Div HQrs\n\nSunday 22nd April\n\nWith Capt. Forrest rode from Baupaume to Arras. Batteries of Heavy Artillery are Stationed all along the road and were busy as we passed. The Boche was rigorously shelling Monchy, and also a valley in which were placed many of our batteries. \n\nVery interesting to see the old Boche line East of Arras. Took Capt. Forrest to one of the concrete O.Ps. in Arras, and had a short walk around the Town. The Boche was putting in a few heavy shell at the time. Returned to camp about 4 PM\n\nMonday 23rd April\n\nEarly this morning I was aroused by heavy artillery fire on our Left. An attack was in progress in Cherisy and Fontaine Les Croisilles. Visited OCs. 10th and 11th Brigades and DAC re posting of officers. Later with Halford I rode out to ridge south of Croisilles and watched the attack above referred to. Artillery fire from all natures of guns simply terrific. Halford made a sketch of it all. On the way home we rode through Mory.\n\nLoan car arrived from \"K\" Supply column. Halford and I went as far as possible on the Peronne Road in order to see the country around Le Transloy. A very desolate waste, ground nothing but shell holes. Hope to later ride through to Peronne.\n\nTuesday 24th April\n\nWith Halford had a day round the front line. We motored through Beugny towards Lagnicourt. Here we left car and proceeded on foot to Eastward of Lagnicourt where many Boche victims of 15th April still lay unburied, affording food for cats of the village. Thence onwards to Norueil and to high ground 500 yards Eastward, where we get a good view of every front line and wire. Then on to sunken road leading from Norueil to Longatte. At the highest point of the road one gets a magnificent view of Bullecourt, Mendecourt and Riencourt, and it is from this spot that I hope to watch the attack, now postponed from 27th to 30th inst. Called on Col. Waite and Col. King. Picked up car at the Sucerie and returned home at 4 PM Major Bates at conference at Corps HQrs.\n\nNo news of Cherisy attack, or of French operations southward.\n\nWednesday 25th April\n\n\"Anzac Day\". What memories it recalls. Two years have flown as on wings. With Capt. Forrest and Lt. Ashe our Signal officer I rode to Peronne. We passed through the villages of Baulencourt, Le Transloy, Sailly-Saillisel, Rancourt, Bouchavesnes, Mt. St. Quentin on the way to Peronne. and on the return journey came through Clery Sur Somme, Maurepas, Combles, Guillement, Ginchy and Guedecourt. We had a most interesting day, especially in the country where the French fought so bravely in the early stages of the Somme battle last year. We brought back a few French bayonets and a rifle, besides grenades as souvenirs. Particularly interesting was the ride through Guedecourt and across Stormy Trench, which is so definitely associated with the 4th Aus. Division. Peronne is prettily situated on the Somme, but has been much damaged, principally by the Boche when evacuating. The whole country from Baupaume to Peronne is a wilderness waste, the result of continuous heavy artillery bombardment, and one can well imagine how glad the Boche soldiery must have been to evacuate this zone and get to a new line in open and undamaged fields.\n\nThursday 26th April\n\nWith Major Bates left Baupaume for Amiens at 10 AM. Called at Divisional Head Quarters at Baizeau, saw General Holmes and described to him details of Boche attack on morning of 15th inst. Recommended Lt. Col. Vernon for Legion of Honour. Informed all recommendations for immediate honors to members of 4th Aus Div Artillery sent in a few days since, have been recommended by Divisional Commander and forwarded on to Corps. Called at 1st Anzac Artillery School. Left my groom there to bring my horse (Jack) back to Baupaume. Went on to Amiens to lunch, and did some shopping. Had another look through the Cathedral. Returned home at 6.30 PM Informed projected operations of 2nd Aus Div and 62nd Division again postponed, this time to","753":" Received Australian mail with letters from Nell, Alvord and Chris, also papers from Nell. Wrote letters all the evening.\n","754":"\n\nStayed in office all day. Bright sunny day. Weather appears at last to be improving. General Napier round the front with Col. King. Majors Bates and Williams also round. Enemy shelling somewhat brisk. Major Williams dined with us.\n","755":"\n\nEnemy artillery fire very brisk especially at Longatte. At the 39th Battery O.P.

Edwards in Baupaume Cemetery. Again the DAC provided the firing party. Service conducted by Padre Stevenson. Later I went to advanced Corps HQrs. Saw General White to whom I gave a sketch of Bullecourt and Riencourt, also AD of Signals and Major Wynter. General White informed me I could apply for 14 days leave. I shall arrange to get it after we come out of the line.\n","759":"\n\nCapt. Forrest left for three days leave to Caestre. Heavy fighting North and South of the Scarpe River. Germans are throwing in many counter attacks and he is losing heavily from our Artillery and machine gun fire. America has decided for conscription by overwhelming majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Expect we shall soon see American troops here. Late in evening received a wire from Capt. Forrest that car had broken down near Hazebrouck and was being towed to that town for repairs.\n","760":"\n\nWent round the front and selected positions in Noruiel–Longatte road from which I can watch the battle on the 3rd instant. A telephone will be installed for me, to be in communication with Col. King’s group. A.I.F. order published to day awarded 12 military medals to 4th Aus Div Artillery. Batteries that have been out are returning to night to position in the line. Hard fighting continues on the north.\n","761":"\n\nRode round country to East and South East of Baupaume. My route from camp was through Bancourt, Haplincourt, Bertincourt, Ytres, Manancourt, Mesnil, Rocquigny, Barastre, Fremicourt and Favreuil. Roads are wonderfully good, an enormous amount of work having been carried out on them by our troops. Quite the best way to go to Peronne from Baupaume.\n\nAll arrangements completed for attack tomorrow morning, commencing at 3.45 AM A number of officers and men wounded and killed to day. Lt. Carse and Brough of 12th Army Brigade both died of wounds.\n","762":"\n\nThis morning at 3.45 British forces launched heavy attacks against the German line, extending from north of the Scarpe to Queant. Our immediate task here coupled with the 62nd British Division is to take Bullecourt, Hindenburg Line, Hendecourt and Riencourt.\n\nI got up at 2 AM, had breakfast and rode out to Vauxcourt, then walked on passed Col. King’s battle head Quarters to my post in Longatte-Norueil Road. Halford and Benson accompanied me. Punctually to time the artillery barrage commenced, and such a terrific cannonade I have never before witnessed. We had the equivalent of","763":" Divisional Artilleries with the 2nd Aus Div Infantry who were attacking, while the 62nd Division had I understand equal artillery strength.\n\nThen in addition the heavy artillery has to be added. This included guns and howitzers of all calibres from 15\" to 60 pr. Added to our fire was the Boche barrage which came down very promptly, mostly heavy H.E. shell. Our artillery barrage was excellent, very few shrapnel bursting high. Until daylight nothing could be discerned of our troop movements. Even when the sun arose nothing could be seen, other than bursting shell. The day was very hazy and the spume and dust from the artillery bombardment made an impenetrable screen. I waited till 7 PM and then returned home. While in the sunken road shelling was uncomfortably close. Saw General Howse at the road dressing Station also Capt. Bean.\n\nBy night fall the position appeared to be as follows: our 5th and 6th Brigades had taken and were holding the front and support levies of the Hindenburg Line, the 62nd Division had failed to take Bullecourt, and this evening the 7th Division is to try to secure this strong point. Apparently very heavy fighting continued throughout the day and the amount of artillery ammunition expended on both sides was enormous.\n\nOur trench mortar batteries who were to assist the 62nd after the capture of Bullecourt had a bad time. Owing to the 62nd being held up our men had to wait, and came under heavy Artillery barrage from the enemy. The result is that of 48 men, 9 were killed, 8 shell shocked, 13 wounded, and all the remainder missing believe killed. Strangely enough and very fortunately all four officers present were saved, but badly shaken. Lt. O’Reilly with 10th Brigade did magnificent work with the Infantry in the captured trenches as F.O.O., his information being the most consistent and reliable of all that came through, which apart from his was very meagre. Our wounded who passed through our Ambulances up to 6 PM total about 2500 – no estimate can at present be made of killed or missing.\n\nFriday 4th May\n\nDuring the night our right flank gave a little ground under enemy bomb attack. Bullecourt still held by the evening. The 7th Division is relieving the 62nd, and the 1st Aus Div Infantry Brigades are relieving those of 2nd Aus. Division. Very sorry to learn that last night Lt. O’Reilly was killed. He had done excellent work and I was recommending him for the Military Cross, but under the regulations this cannot now be done. Received reports from Trench Mortar officers of 4th Aus Div They had a most trying experience, and behaved most gallantly. Boche plane dropped several bombs in Baupaume this evening.\n","764":"\n\nThe Boche is fighting hard to hold his present line. He is throwing in heavy reserves, and counter attacking frequently. As a consequence we are killing Boche in large numbers. We still hold the Hindenburg Line between Bullecourt and Queant, but the enemy still holds Bullecourt. I presume we shall keep on attacking till our final objective for 3rd May is secured. Bombs dropped last night unfortunately caused casualties in 12th Army Brigade, Capt. Collins and Lt. Lewis being killed, and a visiting Lieutenant also very seriously wounded. Oppressively hot day, followed by heavy thunderstorm in the evening. Major Matterson RGA, who was under my command with a 60 pr. Battery at Serapeum in May 1916, called to see me. He now commands a 6\" Mark VII Battery, two guns of which are working with 5th Corps, and 2 with 1st Anzac Corps. Gen. Russell G.O.C. New Zealand Division, accompanied General Birdwood around the front during this afternoon.\n\nInfantry put up S.A.S. Signals about 10 PM tonight and for an hour we put up a terrific bombardment – all unnecessary, no attack having apparently been intended by the Boche.\n\nSunday 6th May\n\nSent in recommendation for Lt. Anderson for Military Cross, and 4 men of Trench Mortars for Military Medals, in connection with operations of 3rd inst. Wrote letters during morning. In afternoon went round some of the Batteries. The 58th Division is to attack Bullecourt early tomorrow morning. Lt. Callinan who was wounded by bomb on 5th died this morning.\n","765":"\n\nIn the morning rode out to Advanced Divisional HQrs. Informed 58th Division this morning secured their objective in Bullecourt and linked up with Anzac Corps on the right. I should have said 7th Div. not 58th Div. carried out this attack. Visited 42nd, 43rd and 38th Batteries. British Batteries foolishly bringing up ammunition to their guns during the day, consequently Ecoust Valley was heavily shelled. At night with Major Bates dined with D.A.C. HQrs. officers. Infantry band gave us a number of fine selections. Looked through a large German Cemetery in Favreuil wood. Rain set in about 10 PM.\n\nDivisional Commander wrote asking me to command Division during his forthcoming leave of absence.\n","766":"\n\nMiserable wet day. Did not go out from HQrs. Lt.

Whether this is or is not a permanent move is not known. I understand our guns are to come out almost at once, and that we are to take part in the Wyschaate push up north, commencing somewhere about the beginning of June.\n","768":"\n\nVisited some batteries and 10th Brigade wagon lines. Heard from Mr. MacKellar Solicitor of Sydney re his two sons who are in the Artillery and whom he wants me to help. Boche counter attacked again last evening but did no good to his cause.\n","769":"\n\nWith Major Bates rode down to Stormy Trench, overlooking Guedecourt. Very interesting indeed to walk along and carefully examine this trench, the scene of such fierce fighting between the Boche and the 4th Australian Division. Salvage Corps now busy in this area collecting equipment of every conceivable nature.\n\nAfter lunch called on Mr. Stamp’s workshop. He explained to the Brigade Major and myself the new air recuperator being fitted to 18 pr. guns. W.O. Miller sent off to England for a course to qualify as L.O.M. Divisional Commander wrote me stating that owing to new move for the 4th Aus Div he was not taking his leave at present.\n\nFriday 11th May\n\nIn the morning visited 10th Bde. wagon lines. The wagon lines of 11th Bde. are being shelled today so they are moving back to Baupaume. In the afternoon took tea with General Birdwood and General White. Learned details of our new move. We are still to remain a part of 1st Anzac. Discussed with General White certain points brought to notice during recent Battles. He asked me to prepare them fully and send them on to him as also copy of my notes re Boche attack on Lagnicourt on the morning of 15th April. I am also preparing for him a brief history of the 4th Aus. Div Arty\n\nSaturday 12th May\n\nReceived letter from AAG informing me that Capt. Morris of 3rd F.A. Bde. is to be appointed one of my Battery Commanders and that Temp. Major Evans who is junior is to be deposed. I rode over to Advanced Anzac to see the AAG who was unfortunately not in. I discussed the matter with Capt. Jennings and will write in officially. Received word that some 300 horses are arriving at Abbeville tomorrow for us. Sent off Majors Ross and Evans with a party to bring them back. Continuous fighting at Bullecourt and rather more successful, as the British and ourselves now have the village, and have captured during the night about 500 prisoners.\n\nSunday 13th May\n\nParade at 12.30 PM for DAC and Trench Mortar Batteries for the Corps Commander. He presented ribbons to the men of Trench Mortars who had been awarded the Military Medal. I gave the Corps Commander copy of a letter sent on to the Division re Major Evans, and also discussed the case with him.\n\nCar arrived back from Supply Column. All units of 4th Aus Div Artillery tonight withdrew from the line, and will march tomorrow to camps in the vicinity of entraining Stations at Albert and Edgehill.\n\nMonday 14th May\n\nAt 10.30 AM General Birdwood inspected the 10th and 11th Brigades, and presented ribbons to those men who had recently been awarded Military Medals. Both yesterday and today the General made very nice speeches, and expressed his appreciation of the work of the 4th Div. Artillery, as well as his regret at our temporary detachment from 1st Anzac Corps.\n\nSaw DAC march out at 7 AM. Far from a creditable performance and a detailed criticism has been sent on to the C. Officer. \n\nIn afternoon watched Brigades march out. Very satisfactory.\n\nGave additional evidence before General Johnstone re abandonment of guns of 1st Aus Div\n\nTuesday 15th May\n\nWith Major Bates motored through territory south of the Somme recently given up by the boche. Went through Combles, Clery, Peronne, Ham, Moyon and Roye to Amiens. The last three mentioned towns have been left\n\nundamaged, perhaps indicating a hasty withdrawal on the part of the enemy. The country is very beautiful, and at the present time the fruit trees of which there is an abundance, are all in blossom. No trees of any kind appear to have been destroyed, the only damage done appears to be to a few bridges, and road intersections blown up by mines. When crossing the old front line system near Roye one could not help being struck by its undamaged condition. It is apparent that on both sides in this locality the fighting during the last winter has been a negligible quantity, and very different to the vicinity of Flers and Guedecourt.\n\nLunched at Amiens, and on the way back to Baupaume called on General Holmes at Divisional HQrs. at Baizieu.\n\nWednesday 16th May\n\nMajor Bates and myself left Baupaume about 9.30 AM and motored through to Ballieul. On the way past Arras we went up on to Vimy Ridge, and though the day was hazy one got a magnificent view. It is indeed a commanding point and I can well understand the disappointment of the Boche in losing it. Because of the recent advance in this sector it is now possible to motor through from Arras to Bethune on the main road. We lunched at Bethune, then came on to Hazebrouck, Caestre and Ballieul. At the latter place met Capt. Forrest and Divisional Staff. Comfortable billets arranged for us. Called on G.O.C. R.A., Brig. Gen. Powell, and talked over the situation generally. Pending arrival of our HQrs. by rail we are messing at Officers Club. Country everywhere very beautiful.\n\nThursday 17th May\n\nWent out early with Major Bates to New Zealand Divisional Artillery HQrs. Saw the Brigade Major, Major Richmond, and with him went through the proposed scheme of offence for this sector. Units commenced to arrive during the night. Billets are arranged not far from Ballieul, while troops are detraining at Ballieul and Caestre. Having our meals with officers club pending the establishment of our own mess.\n\nFriday 18th May\n\nWith Major Bates went out at 9.0 AM to West HOF FARM, HQrs. of N.Z. Division. General Johnstone C.R.A. then accompanied us around all the field Artillery positions (being prepared for forthcoming operations) which will be occupied by the Artillery under his command.\n\nThey are mostly situated near Wulverghemand Hill 63. Quite a lot of work has been done, but our units will have much to do before positions can be considered as ready. Most ammunition will be delivered by Decauville. Balance of units completed detraining and marched into billets. I have arranged that when they go into the line, they may be given no night work for at least a week in order that they men may get some well deserved sleep. Letters and photos from Nell. Very good indeed.\n\nSaturday 19th May\n\nAttended to office work during the morning. In the afternoon attended a conference at 4th Aus Div HQrs. The new operations were fully discussed. Later a discussion took place re reduction of horses and instructions given for proposals to be in tomorrow. Mess established in Building opposite the office. Leave to England for Major Bates approved. Trench Mortar Batteries temporarily loaned for forthcoming operation to 3rd Aus. Div Arty Guns being sent to G.O.M. for overhaul. Lt. Anderson awarded M.C. for his work at Bullecourt on 3rd instant.\n\nSunday 20th May\n\nMajor Bates left at 10.30 AM for Boulogne on leave to England. Lt. Rayburn accompanied him. Brigades advised to move to their wagon lines. In afternoon Halford and myself rode to 3rd D.A.H.Q. at Steenwerke. Saw General Grimwade C.R.A. and Major Playfair, Major Nicholls and Capt. Irvine. Stayed to afternoon tea. Interviewed Paymaster 4th Aus Div with Major Williams and Major de Low concerning delay in return to pay office of rolls. Matter cleared up satisfactorily. Wrote a brief history of 4th Aus. Div Arty\n\nMonday 21st May\n\nCorps Commander called on me at 10.30 AM and I took him round wagon lines of 10th Bde. and DAC. The units were of course far from being spick and span, having only the night before marched into these wagon lines. Horses are improving fast and both units have a nice field for grazing, while watering arrangements are also very satisfactory. troughs being provided in each field with pumps. Corps Commander had not time to go forward to","770":" Brigade area. Heard today that H.M.

I expect I shall get about 6 days only instead of 14 as was first arranged. Wrote all my Sunday letters to members of the family.\n","783":"\n\nWith Colonel Vernon left in car for Boulogne on leave to England. Found boat did not leave till afternoon. Reached Folkestone about 4.30 PM and London about 7 PM I went to Whitehall Hotel to stay. Had a long talk with Miss Perks and Mrs. MacLaren who are still staying there.\n","784":"\n\nCalled on Miss Cowlishaw and with her went to Oxford. Saw General and Mrs. MacLagan there. Visited most of the Colleges, the one appealing to me most I think being Magdalene College. Saw the river at this point full of boats laden with Cadet Officers and young ladies. Trees, flowers and fields are a charming sight just now. Chestnut trees being in full bloom, also lilac and rhododendron. Lunched at MITRE Hotel in the main street. More colleges now given over to Military authorities for Cadet School work and Hospitals.\n","785":"\n\nWhitsuntide Holiday. Caught midday train to Bradford (via Leeds) arriving about 6 PM Not remembering John Halford’s new address I went first to Chesham Grove. Mr. Halford Sen., is very frail but seems to be improving in health. John and Edith came down and we all stayed to tea.\n\nJohn’s new home is very nicely situated, is substantially built of stone and roomy. Fitted up with electricity throughout.\n\nTalked with John and Edith till nearly midnight.\n","786":"\n\nWith Edith walked through the Reserve’s Park and the Golf Links. Bluebells everywhere in abundance. John stayed home in the afternoon. Holiday in town. Nell and Ruth came up to tea. Left Bradford about 7.30 PM for Ireland via Fleetwood, leaving the latter place about 11 PM. The skipper of the boat informed me that service had recently been temporarily suspended owing to enemy submarine action in the Irish Sea. He asked me to arrange a military guard to maintain order in case of a submarine attack.\n","787":"\n\nArrived in Belfast about 8 PM. Lt. McKinstry came aboard, introduced himself and told me he had his car waiting to take me to their home. Rather a miserable day so remained indoors. Mrs. McKinstry and her daughter Mrs. Rosborough pressed me to abandon my trip to Ballyshannon and stay with them at Belfast. As the son was home on leave he was available to drive their car, and they promised to drive me around the country to the most interesting places. I finally decided to remain in Belfast. A second married daughter was also at the house.\n","788":"\n\nA trip was arranged to Bangor, a favourite summer resort on the coast at the entrance to Belfast Lough\n\nWe had two punctures on the way there, and had to walk part of the way into the town, where tubes were repaired. We returned home about 7 PM. The country is exceedingly beautiful and the Rhododendrons in particular make an exceedingly fine show. At night we went to see a play in the local theatre.\n","789":"\n\nAnother motor run was arranged for to day. This time to another favourite watering place named NewCastle situated on the shores of Dundrum bay and just at the foot of the Mourne mountains. Here there is a magnificent Hotel, golf links etc. On the way down we passed through Downpatrick. We had a look at the restored Cathedral and visited the grave of Ireland’s patron Saint, St. Patrick. Here again we had another puncture. We brought back home an enormous bunch of beautiful lilac blooms. At night I sang a few songs.\n","790":"\n\nTo day we had quite a long run, about 170 miles. Leaving Belfast at 10 AM we skirted the shores of Belfast and Larne LoughS, passing through Carrickfergus and Larne. We then continued up the coast road of the rugged Antrim shore through Glenarm, Carnlough and Cushendall. At this latter place we took the road leading over the high moor land to BallyCastle.\n\nThe moors are very interesting. Covered with gorse in full bloom, heather not yet in flower they looked very pretty indeed. Here and there are the bogs from which thousands of tons of peat were being taken for winter fuel. From BallyCastle we again took the coast road to Ballintoy and Giants Causeway. At the Hotel at the latter place we had lunch, and then inspected the huge cave and the Causeway from the sea, going round in a roomy boat, and returning over land. The formation is intensely interesting. I sat on the famous wishing chair and had the three wishes allowed by custom, later having a drink of clear water and another wish at the wishing well. Our guide told us all sorts of weird superstitious stories. We then motored on to Portrush, another fashionable summer seaside resort. Here we had afternoon tea and then returned homewards via Coleraine, Ballymoney and BallyMena to Randalstown. This latter town is where Rev. McKinstrey’s Church and congregation are. He met us at his manse and then showed us the famous old grounds and Castle on the Banks of Lough Neagh, known as Shane's Castle. I have never before seen such a magnificent show of Rhododendrons, while the whole 2000 acres of the estate was in reality carpeted with prunises and bluebell. The River Main runs through the property and is open to invalid soldiers for fishing. The old Castle too is historic, and I was told the origin of the Red Hand of Ulster borne on the Arms of the O’Neill family who own the property. We returned to Belfast at 9 PM. In each of these journeys the party has consisted of Mrs. McKinstry, her son, two married daughters and myself and all have been intensely interesting and most enjoyable.\n","791":"\n\nIn the morning we went into the Botanical Gardens to see a magnificent display of Tulips as well as the content of glass houses and fernery. In the afternoon I left Belfast, catching train at 4 PM, and arrived in Dublin about 7 o ’clock. There caught train to Kingstown, boarded the Cross Channel boat, crossed to Holyhead and left there at 12.22 AM by train for London. Crossing rather choppy and I did not feel very comfortable. Holiday in Ireland most enjoyable.\n","792":"\n\nArrived London at 6.30 AM Drove to Whitehall, had bath and breakfast. Made a few purchases in London. Caught train in afternoon for Folkestone. Sent my dressing case over by boat, then arranged to fly over from Folkestone Aerodrome to St. Omer, and telephoned for my car to meet me at St. Omer. We ascended about 6.30 PM, Hovered over Folkestone and Dover for about 15 minutes then headed for the French Coast, which we crossed just south of Calais and reached St. Omer 65 minutes after starting out. It was a beautifully clear and still evening and I had a magnificent view of the Channel and the Dover Patrol. We used a F.E.2B. machine and flew at an average height of 3800 feet. The experience was a most enjoyable and exhilarating one. I dined with the R.F.C. at their Aerodrome at St. Omer, and later came on home in the car. Created C.M.G.\n\nTuesday 5th June\n\nWent through orders concerning forthcoming operations now definitely fixed for the morning of 7th inst. Lunched with Gen. Holmes and discussed with him details of attack by 4th Aus Div on the Green LINE. Received Congratulatory wire from Gen. Plumer, 2nd Army Commander. I hear the 5th Army including 1st Anzac is shortly to arrive close to us for proposed operations further north. I understand we shall then go back to 1st Anzac. The","793":" Corps Dump just outside Ballieul was blown up this morning and the explosions were so severe that a great deal of window glass in the town has been destroyed by concussion. The local population have been very busy all day moving their effects further away from the Battle Zone.\n","794":"\n\nThis morning I called on General Grimwade re 4 of B.Cs. sent to him and also re trench mortar batteries. I then went on to N.Z. Artillery HQrs. where Bates and Forrest are now both established. We move up tomorrow. Went through schemes. A great deal of Artillery activity on both sides.\n\nBallieul being shelled at intervals by long range heavy gun.\n\nThursday 7th June\n\nTo day the greatest battle scenes ever witnessed were enacted. At 3.10 AM a number of mines which had been laid under Boche positions from Hill 60 to Messines were exploded causing the earth to tremble as if a violent earthquake was in progress. Simultaneously thousands of guns (about 2550) of all calibres from 18 pr. to 15\" loosed off and under the finest barrage ever conceived our Infantry advanced over a nine mile front everywhere capturing all objectives.\n\nIn our Corps front the attack was launched by the 3rd Aus Div, N.Z. Div. and 25th Div., while the","795":" Aus Div was in reserve, and after the first objectives had been taken they pushed through and captured the advanced objectives. The whole show was a huge dramatic success, all objectives being gained to time table and with light casualties, while the Boche lost 7000 prisoners, many guns, mortars and machine guns, and had thousands killed. I went up close behind Messines during the afternoon, everywhere the effects of the terrific Artillery bombardment being in evidence.\n","796":"\n\nThe battle still continues though in a lesser degree, simply straightening out unsatisfactory pockets. The Boche has shelled the new front lines fairly solidly, as well as Messines but has fired little on our batteries. As a consequence they have suffered few casualties. Tomorrow I take over from C.R.A. New Zealand Division who has up to now had command of his own guns, 4th Aus Div, and two extra Brigades.\n","797":"\n\nAt 3.45 AM I left my billet for a reconnaissance of the whole of our front line. I crossed over North West of Messines to our new front line and thoroughly investigated the positions held by our troops. Many dead Boche to be seen and a few of our own men. Tanks had got well up to our front line and close behind were two derelict. They had got into a soft patch of soil, and had in their struggles to get out only further buried themselves. Our new positions afford excellent opportunity for Artillery observation and control of fire. Commander in Chief called at Westhof Farm and was very congratulatory in his reference to all arms of the Service. He sent a special message of thanks to the gunners.\n\nTook over Artillery command at 5 PM from Gen. Johnstone C.R.A. N.Z. Division.\n\nSunday 10th June\n\nBalance of 4th A.D.A HQrs. moved from Balliel to Westhof Farm. Batteries of all groups being moved well forward behind Messines. Getting new maps etc. prepared and generally rearranging our offices. A new offensive to improve our front will soon eventuate. Conference with Gen. Godley and Divisional Commanders of 25th and 4th Aus. Divs. Decided to straighten out a portion of the line tonight at 10.30 and an artillery programme proposed accordingly. Tomorrow I shall have under my command, 4th N.Z. and 25th Div. Artilleries, Col. Cockraft ’s Brigade and one Battery – a total of 29 batteries equally 174 guns. This Command will take some handling. Our trench mortars of all Divisions are temporarily helping","798":" Aus Div in wire cutting tasks. Wrote my usual weekly budget of letters.\n","799":"\n\nLittle operation last night quite successful. Our Infantry found over 100 dead in the German position, apparently killed by Artillery fire – Artillery of both sides very active during the night.\n\nDuring today our mounted troops pushed forward towards the Warneton line – followed by Infantry patrols, who will establish themselves well in front of the Green Line if possible.\n\nN.Z. Division taking over from 3rd Aus Div, Gen. Johnstone taking over command of the massed Artillery. Later 25th Division is to relieve 4th Aus Div at which time the 25th Div. CRA will assume command of combined Artillery. To day his artillery and Col. Cockraft’s Brigade came under my command. Received very kind letter of congratulation from Lt. Gen. Sir H.V. Cox, our late Divisional Commander.\n","800":"\n\nOur Infantry Patrols last night established themselves about 300 yards Eastward of our present established front line. Machine gun fire prevented further advance. We are now close up to the Warneton line, which we may expect will be held in strength by the Boche.\n\nReceived orders to hand over Artillery Command to 25th Division at 6 AM tomorrow. Called on CRA 25th Division during afternoon. Arranged for my Brigade Major and Staff Captain to assist staff of 25th D.A. as may be required.\n","801":"\n\nAt 6 AM handed over Artillery Command to C.R.A. 25th Division. At 9 AM accompanied by Lt. Halford and Corporal Benson I motored to Llankhof Farm near Ypres. Walked through Lock 7 where we inspected our old concrete O.P. structure which has been used for some time as an Artillery Brigade HQrs., thence on through Verbranden Molen to Hill 60 where we saw the crater of mine blown up on morning of 7th inst. It is about 100 yards in diameter and about 40 feet deep. In the vicinity we saw French bayonets, equipment etc., relics of the early fighting in 1914. We then walked on to the Bluff thence across the canal to White Chateaux, incidentally being forced to take cover for some time from 4.2\" shelling. Then on to St. Eloi, where we saw another new crater similar in size to the one at Hill 60. Then on through Wytschaete to Messines and back to our car at Wulverghem. Between Wytschaete and Messines we saw two more craters, each being about 150 yards across and fifty to sixty feet deep. It was a very hot trying day but the walk was exceedingly interesting. Such a walk shows one very clearly how the line Wytschaete-Messines has dominated the British lines since the end of 1914, and it now in turn gives us domination over the Boche territory. Guns have been pushed forward all along the line, also our balloons, while our Air Service absolutely dominates the air.\n\nThursday 14th June\n\nSpent most of the day in visiting Battery positions of 4th Aus Div All have established themselves reasonably comfortably.\n\nFriday 15th June\n\nCapt. Forrest went on leave to England. Halford and I went with him as far as Cassell, calling at Hazebrouck en route. Gen. Robertson joined car at Cassell he too going on leave. Called on M.G.R.A. and obtained map locations of all batteries engaged in recent battle, and also mine craters. Halford preparing a combined map for me. Visited the old Church at Cassell, a grotesque mixture of Gothic and Classic. Heavy casualties in 110th Battery.\n\nSaturday 16th June\n\nAgain around battery positions. It has been decided that we are to be relieved tomorrow night. All our men will be glad of a short rest and clean up. Wonderful evolution this evening by Naval Triplane.\n\nSunday 17th June\n\nGen. Holmes with Col. Bernard journied to 1st Army and were shown over the Vimy Ridge position. They found it exceedingly interesting. I spent the day writing letters. An Australian mail delivered last night. They are now very irregular and infrequent. Col. Rabett and Major Richards dined with us. Discussed many matters of common interest.\n\nMonday 18th June\n\nSaw Mr. Brissenden in Ballieul. He is now Claims Officer of 3rd Aus Div Had a long talk over old times.\n\nAttended a conference of Gunner Generals at Cassell under the Presidency of Major General Franks R.A. to discuss details of recent operations from a gunner’s point of view. Much interesting discussion. Among those present were Gen. Wardrop 14th Corps, Gen. Cartwright 1st British Division, Gen. Shepherd who served under me at Gallipoli, Gen. Lushington of 41st Division and many others, about 30 in all. Gen. Franks invited us to lunch afterwards, and there were also present a number of American Gunner Officers who are looking round the 2 nd Brig. Front. Received letter from Admiralty stating that Charley would be granted leave to France before he took up his duties as Sub Lieutenant, which rank has evidently been given him. He should soon therefore be over here. Gen. Watson 4th Can. Div. called with his Staff.\n\nTuesday 19th June\n\nHQrs. 4th Aus Div moved down to the vicinity of Strazeele. There is still much uncertainty regarding our future. CRE and myself with our Staffs are staying on here temporarily, and we are given to understand that in about 10 days time we shall relieve the N.Z. Division at Armentieres and then later become G.H.Q. reserve. Another Zeppelin brought down in England. Boche very quiet on the front. He has evidently decided it is useless to further try to regain his lost territory here.\n\nWednesday 20th June\n\nBatteries cleaning up generally. Men being bathed and supplied with clean underclothing. Gen. Godley inspected wagon lines. All guns inspected by I.O.M. Five men from 10th Brigade awarded Military Medals for bravery in action before Bullecourt. Forwarded recommendation for M.M. on account of three men of D.A.C. Two Boche planes came over our lines this evening at a terrific speed and brought down in flames two from balloons. Occupants escaped safely in parachutes. Bates invited all B.Cs. to dinner at Ballieul.\n\nThursday 21st June\n\nGen. Jobson and his HQrs. arrived at Westhof Farm to day, and are remaining here till tomorrow. He lunched with our Mess.\n\nReceived letter from Nell dated April 22nd, previous one being March 24th. Evidently five letters or at least four are missing.\n\nAttended in the afternoon at 11th Brigade wagon lines to witness a cricket match between 10th and 11th Brigades. The latter easily won. \n\nAt night 10th Brigade had a Concert but I did not attend.\n\nFriday 22nd June\n\nReceived instructions today to vacate our quarters here. Heavy Artillery G.O.C. and staff are taking possession as from noon on Monday next, and we will go back to the Division’s HQrs. Out riding during the afternoon.\n\nSaturday 23rd June\n\nGOC Division and Col. Bernard watched the 10th Brigade pass our Head Quarters. Generally a very good turn out.\n\nAbout 1 o’clock Boche planes attacked our balloons, and succeeded in igniting three, which quickly fell in flames. Altogether about 6 balloons were involved, and for a time the air was full of descending parachutes. All observers I understand reached the ground safely. During the afternoon Major Lord Bentwick lectured to our senior N.C.Os. and officers on horse management. He gave an interesting lecture. The last time I saw him was on board HMS TBD. Harpy off Gallipoli. We were landing from the Destroyer and were badly shelled by the Turks, suffering 42 casualties. He remembered the incident very well indeed.\n\nLate in the afternoon I rode to Kemmell where a magnificent view is obtainable of the whole Country over which the recent advance was made as also beyond to the North, East and South. I shall get Corporal Benson to make a sketch from the summit.\n\nSunday 24th June\n\nParade of 11th Brigade during morning. Wrote letters during afternoon. Preparing to move out of these HQrs. tomorrow morning. Three balloons brought down by Boche planes. Took Benson to Kemmell to make sketch of Messines Ridge. Bates also rode out later with Col. Waite, and incidentally had a nasty fall from his horse. Boche planes dropped bombs all around our camps last night, but no damage close to Artillery.\n\nMonday 25th June\n\nMoved out to Vieux Berquin during the day and Heavy Artillery occupied Westhof Farm. Lunched at Ballieul Club. Afterwards with Major Bates attended 11th Brigade sports. They had a very good show indeed. Am informed we are to take over from New Zealand Artillery at the end of the month. Preparation being made for special parade in Ballieul tomorrow afternoon. 11th Bde. dinner at night.\n\nTuesday 26th June\n\nDivisional Commander watched the DAC on its route march. It made a very creditable showing – this was yesterday. Today the 10th Brigade are again marching out. At General Holmes’ request I accompanied him to the special parade in Ballieul at 2.30 PM at which His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught reviewed representatives from all Divisions of the 2nd Anzac Corps. All made a very good showing. Gen. Plumer was present and a numberless host of generals of all grades. Gen. Holmes accompanied me to 11th Brigade sports afterwards.\n\nWednesday 27th June\n\nAccompanied by General Holmes and Major Bates I left Vieux Berquin at 7.30 AM to visit Belgian G.H.Q. at Houthem, and to see part of the front in that sector. On our way up we called in at an Aerodrome and examined the latest Biplanes and Triplanes. General Arnould, Director of Artillery Belgian Army gave us his morning and took us out to see many battery positions, the trench systems and part of the inundated country. We lunched at G.H.Q. mess, and afterwards were taken to see the Aviation, Intelligence and Topographical Sections. All were very interesting and seemed very efficient. We came back home through Poperingheon our way seeing another of our balloons brought down in flames.\n\nThursday 28th June\n\nWith Major Bates and N.Z.D.A. Brigade Major inspected Battery positions to be taken up by 11th Brigade on the south side of our new front. The Boche artillery has of late been very active and has done a good deal of damage. Plenty of suitable positions available. Lunched at NZDA HQrs. O.Cs. 10th and 11th Bdes. will take over present Artillery group HQrs. of N.Z. Division Artillery.\n\nFriday 29th June\n\nWith Major Bates and D.T.M.O. visited Artillery School at Tilques (2nd Army). The Colonel Commandant shewed us around and I was agreeably surprised to find such an up to date show. Every facility exists for officers and N.C.Os. to learn their work thoroughly. Later we went to 2nd Army T.M. School at LEULINGHEM.\n\nA special demonstration had been arranged for the benefit of the R.A. Generals of","802":" Army, so we too witnessed it. Met Majs. General Franks, Uwaike and Birch and a number of Corps and Divisional R.A. Generals.

It was a miserably wet day and we were drenched before we reached our billets. HYDE PARK corner in Ploogsteert wood had been very heavily shelled during the previous night, and generally this locality is far from being a healthy one.

He had left Divisional HQrs. about 9.30 AM in company with Mr. Holman Premier of N.S.Wales, intending to show the latter the recent battle ground. The party had just left the car at White Gates, Hill 63, when one solitary H.E. shell arrived severely wounding the General, and knocking Mr. Holman down. A fragment had entered the General’s body under the left shoulder with its exit in the left brEast. He was immediately taken in the car to a Dressing Station where he succumbed a few minutes after arrival never regaining consciousness. Mr. Holman returned at once to Divisional\n\nHead Quarters where he remained till after lunch and then with his Secretary returned to Corps HQrs. In the meantime I had been ordered by 2nd Anzac to assume command of 4th Aus. Division. I at once wired General Birdwood and later wrote him full particulars. The body was removed to 2nd Australian CCS near Steenwerk, and the funeral has been arranged for 3 PM tomorrow. The General’s death has cast quite a gloom over the whole Division, and I for one have lost a good friend. A number of sympathetic wires were received this afternoon notably from the Army Commanders, Gen. Birdwood, Gen. Godley, Gen. Walker and Gen. Hobbs.\n","807":"\n\nEarly this morning Major Holmes, Lt. Col. Travers and Lt. Col. Watson arrived from 1st Anzac to attend the funeral. At the funeral itself the following attended: Representatives from all units of 4th Aus Div, Representatives from the Army Commander General Plumer, who could not himself attend because of the King’s arrival at Army HQrs., Generals Birdwood, Godley, White, Carruthers, Hobbs, Russell, and many others whose names I cannot remember at present. The funeral ceremony was very impressively carried out, Gen. Glasgow’s Brigade finding the firing party and bugles. Major Holmes and Col. Travers are staying till tomorrow to go through and pack the late General’s effects.\n","808":"\n\nThis morning I attended to various papers including several Court Martials. I found it absolutely necessary to recommend the death sentence in the case of 4 men guilty of desertion. At 2 PM in company with Cols. Bernard and Armstrong, Mr. Maxwell, Gens. Glasgow and Robertson with their Brigade Majors I attended at the Ballieul Town Square to meet His Majesty King George. In company with Gen. Plumer he received representative officers of 2nd Anzac and its Divisions, and then inspected the captured trophies from the Messines Battle. Later he left for the vicinity of Neuve Eglise and the Tankodrome.\n\nIn the morning he had visited the old Front lines before Wytschaete and had also gone to the top of Kemmell. An investiture was to have been held at 5.30 PM at Army Head Quarters at which I had been commanded to attend, but owing to Insignia not having arrived from the Lord Chamberlain the Investiture had to be cancelled.\n\nMajor Holmes and Lt. Col. Travers returned to 1st Anzac during the afternoon and I moved my quarters to Divisional HQrs.\n","809":"\n\nAttended to a great number of papers dealing with \"A\" and \"Q\" matters. During the afternoon with Mr. Maxwell rode out to Tankodrome, where an officer conducted us round and described the Tanks. He also showed us the route taken by a tank the previous afternoon in an exhibition before the King, the most notable being the ascent on a 30 ° slope of a concrete block house, and a descent on the far side at an angle of 90 °. Tanks are gradually leaving us for another sphere.\n\nFriday 6th July\n\nAt 6.30 AM with Rogers and Maxwell went round the front. First going through the 41st and 111th Batteries, then inspected O.Ps., thence into N.Zealand Sector and on through Gen. Brand’s front back to his Brigade HQrs. which we reached at 12.30. We then went on to HQrs. New Zealand Brigade at Nieppe, returning to DHQ at 2.30 PM\n\nAt about 7.30 PM the Boche landed a shell just outside Gen. Brand’s mess killing one of his officers, and wounding himself and three others. At about 10 PM I saw them at Col. Welch Field Ambulance and their wounds are not serious excepting those of the Brigade Major Johnstone.\n\nSaturday 7th July\n\nWith Col. Bernard called on Col. Brockman acting in Gen. Brand’s place. With his present improvised staff he can carry on satisfactorily. Gen. Powell called re 6\" Howrs. beside Gen. Brand’s HQrs. He has ordered they shall remain quiescent. Gen. Hart of 4th N.Z. Brigade, Gen. Glasgow and Gen. Robertson dined with us. Received group photo from Belgian G.HQrs.\n\nSunday 8th July\n\nPart four 4th Aus Div Artillery is to come out of the line tonight and be relieved by the N.Z. Artillery. With Col. Bernard called on Gen. Lawford of 41st Division to whom our guns will be attached, also called on CRA 40th and 41st Divisions. Our guns will be placed between St. Eloi and Spoil Bank to assist in an operation which will form the Right flank of the 5th Army attack, soon to eventuate. Owners of our Chateau a French Infantry Captain arrived home for a few days’ leave.\n\nThe Boche dropped about 100 bombs in our area last night, 88 being in Ballieul. A great deal of damage was done, and many casualties caused. Church Parade and Corps Commanders presentation of ribbons cancelled because of inclement weather.\n\nMonday 9th July\n\nGen. McCay arrived from 1st Anzac. In the evening he went to Corps Head Quarters, Ballieul to dine. Col. Rabett whose Brigade is leaving tomorrow for DUNQUERKE dined with us. I promised to do what I could to get his brother attached to his Brigade. Informed that Gen. MacLagan is to be the new Commander for 4th Aus Div and will arrive about the end of this week. I shall be delighted to welcome him both as a keen soldier and an old friend. Gen. Gellibrand and Col. Foote are going over to England to join Gen. MacCay’s staff, the latter to be made a Brigadier General.\n","810":"\n\nCeremonial Parade held at 10 AM at which Gen. Godley, Corps Commander presented Military ribbons, V.C., D.C.O’s, M.C’s, Military Medals and D.C.Ms. About 2500 on parade. Gen. MacCay attended. Gen. MacCay left for Boulogne. We provided his car. In the afternoon I had a powwow with all officers of 4th Aus Div Artillery and gave them final warning that any officers found unsatisfactory in their work, either due to negligence or incompetence, would be recommended for removal from Artillery and if necessary the A.I.F.\n\nWednesday 11th July\n\nThe 10th and 11th Brigades together with \"A\" Echelon D.A.C. moved out, passing starting point at DE SEULE corner at 6.10 AM. Generally the whole show was uniformly very fair. Garling Battery was perhaps the best turned out. The Boche intermittently shelled this corner while they were marching past, but luckily all shells were \"plus\". Received letter from Gen. Birdwood late last night, re 4th Brigade staff, and replied this morning. I also wrote him re MacNaghten and enclosed Gen. Grand’s letter stating he had again succumbed to his old failing. Apparently he still remains unreliable.\n\nThursday 12th July\n\nIn company with Capts. Craig and Maxwell we inspected left sector of our front, examining communication trenches supports, front line, wiring, and finally Subsidiary Line. I am hoping to be able to take the Corps Commander in detail round the front so that he may get some idea of the work done by 4th Aus Div I hear however that he is off on leave tomorrow and will not return till after the 20th, the date on which we are to be relieved in the line. Ballieul badly shelled today and bombed last night. Gen. Gwynne to lunch – he says Corps HQrs. is to move to Fletre.\n\nFriday 13th July\n\nIn company with Capt. Maxwell left HQrs. early for Calais. Paid my respects to new Gocra 2nd Army, thence on to No. 5 Remount depot just south of Calais. A good show. Arranged with the O.C. to have horses selected for colour in future supplies. Motored on to Ambleteuse to 2nd Army Rest Camp. Found this concern under the command of a Colonel who seems peculiarly suited for the appointment. Everybody – officers and men – appear to be having a splendid time, the beach and briny holding many attentions. Our 4th Divisional Artillery personnel at present there speak in terms of the highest praise of the Camp.\n\nCalled at \"Australian Hospital\" at Wimereux and No. 2 Australian General Hospital in close proximity. Talked with about 40 men from all areas of 4th Aus. Division. Found Matron Grey in charge at No. 2 Hospital. She is a very old friend of the Lindsay family and Alice has often spoken of her to me. She recently was Matron at Harefield, England. Returned home via St. Omer-Aire and Merville. At Aire saw Capt. Plouvier, the owner of our Chateau, who with his wife is making a two days’ stay with his married daughter. He introduced us to them. Arrived DAQ at 8.30 PM A huge accumulation of documents to attend to. Wire received from Gen. MacLagan informed us he will arrive at Boulogne on Sunday morning next.\n\nSaturday 14th July\n\nStayed at HQrs. during the morning. Col. Bernard round Brigade HQrs. In afternoon attended Horse show of 4th N.Z. Infantry Brigade, and presented ribbons to prize winners. Quite an excellent show generally. Our D.A.H.Q. wireless picked up POLDAU Station today and took in several messages – one stating that H.M.S. Vanguard had been blown up while at anchor – with great loss of life. I was naturally very anxious about Charley, but later received a wire from him stating he was on Destroyer \"Partridge\" and was quite well. Of the 800 complement only about 2 men and officers were saved from the ship – though fortunately about 100 officers and men were away from the ship at the time of the disaster.\n\nDined with 2nd Australian Casualty Clearing Station officers mess.\n","811":"\n\nCapt. Maxwell left early for Boulogne to meet General MacLagan. Gen. Lawford 41st Division called here, also Gen. Monash who is acting as Corps Commander","812":" Anzac during absence on leave of Gen. Godley.\n\nWaited up till midnight for General MacLagan and then received a wire that he was staying at Boulogne for the night and would reach here about noon tomorrow. \n\n Full details of loss of H.M.S. \"Vanguard\" in yesterday’s Times which reached us to day. Have forwarded copy to Nell. Wrote usual letters.\n","813":"\n\nGeneral MacLagan arrived about noon. Went through many matters with him concerning the Division and after lunch motored out with him to","814":" and","815":" Brigade HQrs. also","816":" New Zealand Brigade HQrs. Met the C.Os. in each case and General MacLagan discussed with them various matters. At 6 PM I arranged for Staff of Divisional HQrs. to meet the General. Col. Barnard and myself dined with Gen. Hart of N.Z. Brigade.\n","817":"\n\nTook General MacLagan to HQrs. of 13th Infantry Brigade, and he discussed many matters with General Glasgow. Later we walked through Anton’s Avenue to Subsidiary Line, thence back to Ultimo Avenue, calling to see Col. Whitham on the journey back, and thence through Ploogrsteert to our HQrs. During the morning the Boche had been heavily shelling our Steenwerck Balloon. An Army Brigade last night reinforced our Artillery in the line. During last night Boche planes were active in 41st Division area where our 4th D.A. are now placed. One bomb casualtied 53 horses in 111th Battery.\n","818":"\n\nAt General MacLagans request I am remaining at DHQ till we hand over to N.Z. Division on 20th inst. The G.O.C. today inspected Transport lines of 4th Brigade. Gens. Delaney and Gwynne called at D.H.Q. and General MacLagan dined at Corps HQrs. Col. Douse who yesterday reported to 1st Aus Div as AA and QMG has returned to this Division to take up a similar appointment here vice Col. Armstrong who is to leave us and is presumably going to a British Division, much to his disgust. Received letter from Mr. Pope thanking me for helping his son to get to St. Johns Wood Cadet School.\n","819":"\n\nStayed at DHQ all day. Not feeling very well. Long interview with Gen. MacLagan. Letter from Charley telling of \"Vanguard\" catastrophe.\n","820":"\n\nLeft Steenwerck at 9 AM and took up HQrs. at Vieux Berquin. Attended to Artillery papers. Received letter from Col. King asking to be relieved of his command. In the evening discussed his case with G.O.C. and arranged to call on GOC. AIF on Sunday for a decision. During afternoon visited 10th Brigade wagon lines and inspected all teams hooked in. A very creditable show indeed. Had a talk with Col. King concerning his letter of this morning. He feels he is on the verge of a collapse. Later called on CRA of 47th and 41st Divisions in order if possible to secure a better HQrs. for Col. King’s group.\n","821":"\n\nIn the morning rode to Hazebrouck and La Motte. At the latter place I saw Colonel Waite, who has certainly improved but seems to be still far from well. Gen. Bessel Browne and his Brigade Major lunched with us. Major Bates had 5 days’ leave to Parisgranted dating from tomorrow, and he will go with me tomorrow as far as Amiens when I go to call on Gen.

Waite and Halford visited wagon lines of 11th Brigade. Col. Waite is being evacuated to England and wished to obtain remainder of his kit from his HQrs. With Halford I went on to 11th & 13th Bde H Qrs. and saw some of the Batteries. They are having a very thin time, being heavily gassed every night. Up to date we have had about 65 casualties to personnel and a similar number to horses. Col. Waite evacuated.\n\nThursday 26th July\n\nWith Major Bates called on Gocra Corps and went through scheme for forthcoming operations.

Birdwood visiting Infantry units. Later I went to see the A..A.G at Hazebrouck re sundry promotions etc. Met CRA 2nd Aus Div there. Discussed details re proposal to treat all A.I.F.

Mahony to go to 5th Aus Div as OC. D.A.C.\n\nSunday 29th July\n\nLetter received from Nell dated","822":" They are few and far between these days.

He had developed a disease of the fore feet which made him continually lame and unsound and because of his advanced age the DD of R. 2nd Army decided he should be cast. In order that he should not be sold to the highest market or possibly ill used I had him shot and am keeping his hoofs to prepare as trophies. It will be many a day before I can secure a similar fine charger.\n\nMonday 13th August\n\nIn the early morning Brigade Major and GSO I visited Artillery O.Ps. Later I accompanied the GOC Division round horse lines of DAC, 43rd, 38th and 39 Batteries. Conditions somewhat unsatisfactory because of recent heavy rain. In the afternoon attended a conference of Brigadiers and Battalion Commanders at HQrs. 3rd Aus. Division under the Divisional Commander. Lessons of recent battles discussed.\n\nLt. Col.

DAC moved to new wagon lines at the foot of Kemmel.\n\nThursday 16th August\n\nAt 4.45 AM watched the Artillery bombardment for our attack by 5th Army opposite Ypres. We viewed the show from the top of Kemmel from which point a magnificent view of the whole country is obtained. General Lushington CRA 41st Division also there. The effect was magical. Thousands of guns – heavy and field – loosing off at a great rate, and the bursting shrapnel together with an occasional exploding dump, made a brilliantly lighted up panorama. In addition the Boche were sending up coloured flares of all descriptions. Our aeroplanes were buzzing overhead and no less than 12 of our observation balloons were up in this Sector long before day light.\n\nLetter from General Birdwood re Gunner Fitzgerald of Trench Mortar Batteries, asking if he is considered suitable for a Commission.\n\nInterview with Capt. Sherwood H.T.M. Battery re his alleged Supersession. He admitted he was in error and requested to be allowed to withdraw his complaint.

I must prepare for my new command.\n\nBoche planes again overhead tonight dropping bombs.\n\nSaturday 18th August\n\nLast night marked the close of my third year of war and today I commence my fourth year. It is marvellous how the months and years roll by and still the end is not in sight.\n\nToday I visited G.H.Q. Machine Gun School at Camiers between Etaples and Boulogne. There must have been fully 200 generals present, including the Commander in Chief and three Army Commanders as well as numerous Corps and Divisional Commanders and Artillery Generals. An illustration was being given of machine guns massed for barrage work. The show was very interesting and certainly brought to notice the possibilities of machine guns in barrage. I arrived back at DHQ at about 9 PM Found an Australian mail had arrived. One letter from Nell dated June 3rd.\n\nSunday 19th August\n\nWith Brigade Major made a complete reconnaissance of our Divisional front for the placing of three forward Brigades of Artillery. Had to dodge some Hun shelling but really had a fairly quiet morning, tho’ only partially successful in securing Battery positions. Heard this afternoon that our boundaries are to be again moved necessitating another side slip on the part of 4th Aus Div Halford left on leave. I understand my transfer to 9th Infantry Brigade is now approved. Notification will arrive possibly tomorrow. Wrote letters during afternoon.\n\nMonday 20th August\n\nBoche bombed rather badly during the night and inflicted a number of casualties in back areas. He has done us no harm so far. Orders received re our new Divisional Front. Our Artillery at last seems to have a reasonable chance of getting a substantial rest.\n\nIn afternoon visited General Monash, GOC 3rd Aus Div and discussed details regarding 9th Infantry Brigade. Good news from Verdun and Italian front. Received notification of appointment to Command of 9th Infantry Brigade. Col. Burgess receives his promotion to Brig. General and takes over from me while Col. Stephenson assumes command of 3rd Arty. AFA Brigade. So I now commence my","834":" year of war with the \"Feet\" as the Infantry is generally designated. Boche again bombing during the night. His methods are a distinct contrast to those of our airmen who do most of their bombing by day when objectives can be seen and accurately located. The Boche chose not do his stunts in the hours of daylight for fear of destruction by our planes.\n","835":"\n\nCalled on General Monash re","836":" Infantry Brigade. Arranged to meet him at Brigade HQrs. on","837":" inst. at 11 AM, with the object of having all C.Os. introduced to me. As Gen. Burgess will probably not arrive here till","838":" inst. I shall return to 4th Aus. DAHQ after seeing Infantry officers, and will hand over on 24th or 25th inst.\n\nCalled at Madame Plouvier Steenwerck (late Div HQrs) and arranged to have my war trophies stored there till a later date.\n\nOrders issued for the relief of Div. Artillery and taking over of new front. Gen. Grimwade called during afternoon.\n","839":"\n\nCol. Joseph 148th Bde., acting CRA 30th Division called re taking over our northern Sector. He comes here at 10 AM tomorrow. We move to RAVELSBURG HQrs. tomorrow. Conference with General re new front, etc., also question of \"Manpower\". The C in C is making special efforts to put an extra 100,000 men in the field at once, and as a consequence anticipates some substantial crumpling of the Boche before November ends.\n\nThursday 23rd August\n\nWent off in morning to Campagne the HQrs. of 9th Infantry Brigade. Here I met General Monash and Gen. Jobson. The Staff and Battalion Commanders were all present and introduced to me. Many matters of common interest discussed. Afterwards Gens. Monash & Jobson gave me an outline of the peculiar characteristic of each C.O. Battalion.\n\nStayed to lunch with Gen. Jobson in his interesting old Chateau. In afternoon went on to Boulogne to arrange about some tailoring, and on the return journey when near Desvres the back axle seized up and we had to leave the car in this town.

Gained much useful information. British Division (66th) not very clear as to position of its front line. Move to Berthen area cancelled, also possible rapid advance through 66th Division.\n","882":"\n\nAt 5.30 AM British and French attacked over a wide front. The 66th Division on an old front also included but progress very uncertain and position not clear. Conference at Divisional HQrs. in the morning and at 1 PM in company with the Assistant B.M I went forward to reconnoitre for a Brigade HQrs. in newly captured area from which I could direct and control my share of the 3rd Division attack now decided for morning of 12th inst. Many dead both British and German to be seen, but when just reaching the first objective of this morning’s advance I was cautioned by an officer and a party of 197th Bde. against showing myself because of Bosche snipers. The position was most obscure, but it appeared that the final objective had not been gained and Bosche were still located among our troops, having not been properly mopped up. As a consequence I could not reconnoitre Augustus Wood where are placed the concrete block houses I intended to use for Brigade HQrs. Numerous isolated parties of British troops were scatted around in shell holes, making no effort to clear up the situation or to reorganise. Altogether the impression given of these troops was most unfavourable. We found two badly wounded men of the Brigade who had lain for two days and nights without food or water. The Brigadier himself admitted to me that his men had received no hot food or drink for 4 days. On our return journey we had to pass through a fairly stiff Bosche barrage and we were thankful to reach the rear in safety. S.O.S. signals were being sent up all\n\nalong the front at 5 PM. During the afternoon saw a Bosche plane shot down in flames and crash, later a British machine came down under control but turned twice over on reaching the ground. I am of opinion anything like a serious counter attack by the Bosche could easily drive in the British troops now in position. In fairness to the 66th Division this is their first fight, and seem to know very little of arrangements always necessary for such operations. Reached our Billets at 11.30 PM very tired indeed. We walked about 10 miles.\n","883":"\n\nFrom information received this morning it appears the 66th Division have fallen back almost to our old front line as handed over to them some days since. Apparently the Bosche did not counter attack, but our troops simply retired. Now it becomes incumbent on Australian Divisions not only to capture the Paschendaal Ridge and Village as intended but also to retake ground lost yesterday afternoon and evening. Conference at Divisional Head Quarters. Informed Battalion Commanders later of new objectives and tasks. Brigade Transport moved to wagon lines East of Ypres at 9.30 AM and troops moved by bus at 2 PM. I was ordered by the Divisional Commander to stay at Winnizeele till tomorrow AM in case he should find it necessary to communicate with me. We are allowed very little time to prepare for our attack which under present arrangements is to eventuate on the early morning of 12th inst. Cold miserable weather and I seem to have caught a heavy cold last night.\n\nThursday 11th October\n\nUnits had a bitterly cold time last night no tents being available. Heavy rain fell and the condition of men was most unsatisfactory. Brigade Major and myself left Winnizeele at 6 AM, called at Divisional HQrs. at Ramparts then on to Bivouac of Battalion, thence to General Robertson’s HQrs. thence to my own Battle HQrs. with General Cameron. Tonight our Battalions take on their approach march prior to battle tomorrow morning. General Cameron’s men took over the line from the 66th Division last night but the actual front line is very indefinite. It will doubtless be cleared up today. The whole arrangements for the ensuing battle have been far too rushed, and the country over which the attack passes is very heavy.\n\nFriday 12th October\n\nAt 5.25 AM this morning our attack commenced. All battalions were formed up on their tape lines by 3 AM. The approach march was difficult, the conditions of the ground only permitting movement at the rate of ¾ mile per hour. The approach march was further interfered with by two Battalions of 4th Aus. Division who used the same route Eastward from Zonnebeke.\n\nDuring the approach march enemy shelling caused a number of casualties. Enemy barrage came down on our front line about five minutes before zero and many casualties resulted, the 36th Battalion losing 50 men before crossing our taped line. The 34th Battalion detailed for 1st objective experienced trouble from Block houses in Augustus Wood and later from Block houses at D.11.d. 25-40. The 10th Brigade after leaving \"jumping off\" tape did not keep touch along inter Brigade boundary but bore away to the left, later gaining touch in vicinity of Red Line. This movement on part of 10th Brigade left a considerable amount of country not mopped up, and the 30th Battalion in consequence dealt with this area, from which a good deal of machine gun fire was being directed.\n\nThe Red Line was taken and occupied by 34th Battalion and upon the Red Protector Barrage lifting, the 35th Battalion promptly followed the Barrage. Considerable trouble was experienced on Right Flank from Blockhouses in vicinity of Tiber Copse, and heavy machine gun fire was encountered on the Left from vicinity of Deck Wood and Crest Farm. As a consequence the reorganised 34th Battalion assisted the 35th in cleaning up Tiber Copse on the Right and the 36th Battalion assisted the 35th on the Left.\n\nThe latter Battalion during the advance from the Red & Blue Line suffered heavy casualties. Its Left Flank Company was wiped out as a unit, also its Reserve Company which had been detailed to assist 10th Brigade if necessary in mopping up of Passchendaele. Casualties were caused mainly by machine gun fire.\n\nOn reaching the Blue Line the position was therefore as follows:- On the Left the 36th Battalion who had suffered heavy casualties, in the centre the 35th Battalion who had suffered most, and on the Right the 34th Battalion.\n\nMy reports received during the Battle were emphatic that my troops had captured the Blue Line, but that nothing\n\ncould be seen of 10th Brigade on the Left, and that the casualties had been so heavy as to make it impossible to advance to the Green LINE.\n\nActing on the personnel instructions of my Divisional Commander orders were issued at 1.30 PM that Blue Line was to be consolidated and held at all costs, while my Left flank was to be refused to join up with the 10th Brigade in vicinity of Deck Wood.\n\nThese orders were definitely received by Company Commanders in the Blue Line. Lt. Col. Milne O.C. 36th Battalion was placed in Command of all Blue Line troops and 33rd Battalion was held in Reserve in D.H.C., two of its Companies being placed at the disposal of Lt. Col. Milne to assist if necessary in repelling counter attacks while the remaining two Companies were held as Brigade Reserve.\n\nDuring the afternoon information was received that Bosche shelling and machine gun fire on Blue Line was intense, and that 10th Brigade had withdrawn to original \"jumping off\" line. Later I was informed troops of 9th Brigade had also fallen back to position running from D.17.b 30-30 to enemy block houses at D.11.c. 30-05. The remnants of 34th, 35th and 36th Battalions were posted on this line under Lt. Col. Milne as O.C. front line, while the 33rd Battalion was held in reserve at D.16.b.\n\nThis was the situation up to and during the night 12th – 13th.\n","884":"\n\nEarly this morning I was informed by my Divisional Commanders that one of our planes flying very low and very early this morning, reported our troops still on the Red Line.\n\nI immediately sent out my Intelligence Officer with written orders to Lt. Col. Milne to personally verify this information, taking necessary covering party with him. This was attempted but on reaching the vicinity of Dealine Copse they were fired on by machine guns from the Copse where Germans were actually seen, and were also fired upon from AsSyria.\n\nI personally interviewed all Battalion Commanders at Seine Block houses and was assured by each one that all men excepting perhaps wounded and a few possible stragglers, had fallen back to line above given.\n\nThis line was in process of consolidation and was last night handed over by Lt. Col. Milne to relieving 11th Brigade.\n\nRegarding the withdrawal of 9th Brigade Troops from Blue Line the evidence is conclusive that the fact of 10th Brigade failing to come up to the Blue Line had no direct bearing on our withdrawal, but our men were driven out by concentrated artillery and machine gun fire. The 10th Brigade not reaching the Blue Line naturally left the high ground at Crest Farm in the possession of the enemy, who from this position and also from Meetcheele heavily machine gunned our Blue Line in enfilade.\n\nFurther the enemy had Field guns, firing point blank, located in Echo Copse and along the roadway in E.7.a, from about 30-70 to 90-50. Gun flashes were also visible from vicinity of Enlist Farm and Encore Wood.\n\nThe attached strength of Battalions gives a definite idea of the heavy fighting involved, and I have formed the opinion that officers and men of all Battalions fought valiantly, and only concentrated machine gun and artillery fire accounted for the withdrawal from the Blue Line (which being on forward slopes could be readily located).\n\nAll officers agree that the Barrage brought down by the Bosche on our Blue Line was the heaviest they had ever witnessed.\n\nThe lessons learnt from the attack on 12th inst. appear to be as follows:-\n\n(a) Enemy has evidently plenty of guns placed for the purpose of denying the high ground south of Passchendaele and the village itself to us. He also has innumerable machine guns.\n\n(b) Silent guns placed well forward to be used only in case of attack.\n\n(c) Special attention must be paid to high ground in vicinity of Meetcheele. Unless this is held by us any advance on our present right would appear to be precarious.\n\n(d) The generally expressed opinion among my officers of all ranks is that our own barrage while accurate, was insufficient, and many enemy machine guns continued firing uninterruptedly through our barrage.\n\n(e) Pace of barrage appeared to be suitable.\n\n(f) The nature of the country is such that at the present time a total advance of approximately 2500 yds. is too much for Infantry to negotiate, especially if any severe\n\nfighting is necessary.\n\nBattle Strength Of Battalions Not Including \"B\" Teams In Camp Near Ypres.\n\nBattn. - Officers - Other Ranks - Total\n\n33rd – 21 – 450 – 471\n\n34th – 19 – 509 – 528\n\n35th – 19 – 450 – 469\n\n36th – 20- 530 – 550\n\nTotals – 79 – 1939 – 2018\n\nStrength Of Battalions After Battle\n\nBattn. - Officers - Other Ranks - Total\n\n33rd – 10 – 231 – 241\n\n34th – 3 – 139 – 142\n\n35th – 4 – 84 – 88\n\n36th – 7 – 130 – 137\n\nTotals – 24 – 584 – 608\n\nBattle Losses\n\nOfficers 55 including 15 Company Commanders\n\nOther Ranks 1355\n\nTotal 1410\n\nMachine Gun Co. and Trench Mortar Battery personnell not included.\n\nThe condition of the Country is appalling, and the condition of all ranks after two bitterly cold and wet nights plus a full day’s heavy fighting is far from satisfactory. All are absolutely fatigued.\n\nSunday 14th October\n\nMy troops relieved during the night by 11th Brigade. Battalions withdrawing to reserve positions where they will reorganise and get as much rest as possible. After 48 hours out of the line they are to go in again for 48 hours and then be finally withdrawn to Campagne area. The 49th Division follows us here, then the Canadians who are to take the famous Passchendaele Ridge and Village which proved too much for us. Gen. Godley’s ADC called.\n\nMonday 15th October\n\nMy troops trying to get a rest. Arrangements made for good supply of whale oil, dry socks, cocoa, rum and underclothing. Shelters also provided. During the afternoon General Godley called at my Brigade Head Quarters. Just as he was arriving the Bosche shelled our HQrs. very severely, and as a consequence he had to rush for shelter, and was detained much longer with us than he intended. My men relieved the 11th Brigade in the line during the night, relief being completed at 6 AM. Our Head Quarters shelled continuously during the night with 5.9\" and gas shell. Everybody affected by gas.\n\nTuesday 16th October\n\nSix new forward posts established about 150 yds. East of our present front line. These are being connected up with a definite trench. Brigadier of 148th Bde., 49th Div., who is to take over from me, arrived at my HQrs. with his Bde. Major, Battalion and Company Commanders. Later Brigadier of 4th Can. Division and GOC 3rd Can. Division called on me, and I gave them full details of the front areas. The Canadians are to do the job we failed to complete. Col. Ironside, GSO I of 4th Can., with Col. Jackson our GSO I came round yesterday.\n\nWeather has improved somewhat. All staff here suffering very much from effect of mustard gas. It specially affects the eyes and throat also bronchial tubes.

My best horse, the Bde. Major’s best horse and the Staff Capt. 2nd horse were all badly wounded, while the Interpreter’s horse was killed. Bosche very busy shelling batteries in vicinity of our Head Quarters and as a consequence we came in for a good deal of attention ourselves. During night three new posts were established about 300 yds. in front of 6 posts established two nights since. We have thus secured a \n\ngood \"jumping off\" ground for the Canadians who are in the near future to take the Passchendaele Ridge and Village.\n\nTroops generally very knocked up. Gas effects very painful.\n","886":"\n\nBosche again bombed rear camps this morning. My best horse again wounded, my second horse killed and my groom badly wounded.

In the afternoon Signal Section of 148th Bde. took over from our signals and at night 9th Brigade was relieved, relief being completed and Command passing at 10.30 PM Major Wootten and myself then walked back to Ypres having to run the gauntlet of enemy shelling for about 400 yds. from our Head Quarters.

Division provided us with a substantial supper, and billets for the night with","887":" Field Co. Engineers.\n\nCapt. Tolley, Lt. Brodie and Lt.

In view however of our early move back to \n\nCampagne area I arranged that we should be again examined in two or three days and if no substantial improvement is apparent both Major Wootten and myself will be sent off to a Hospital for special treatment for one week, possibly to the Coast Hospital at Dieppe. I certainly seem to have crowded more genuine physical suffering into the last few days than I have experienced in the accumulated troubles of my whole life. Bosche very active bombing during the early part of the night.\n","890":"\n\nEarly this morning the Bosche planes dropped about 100 bombs in our area, twenty of which fell within four hundred yards of our camp.

Bitterly cold day.\n\nSaturday 2nd March\n\nDuring morning attended with Divisional Commanders at Bulford Camp. Here we saw the Raiding Party for night of March 3rd\/4th do their task across a model piece of country. Afterwards both Parties were formed up, and the General addressed them in rousing terms. In afternoon at Brigade Head Quarters.\n","1001":"\n\nGeneral Birdwood accompanied by the Divisional Commander and myself watched the Raiding Party for night of March 4th\/5th go on their course. Gen. Birdwood then addressed both parties and wished them luck. All final arrangements completed at Brigade HQrs.\n\nPromptly to time 11.45 PM our men entered into their tasks. They carried out their duty splendidly all tasks being fully completed and to time table. We captured 1 officer and 10 other ranks of the enemy, one Heavy Machine Gun and two light M.Guns. We killed over fifty Boche and there must be many wounded in addition. Our casualties were killed 1 officer, 3 other ranks, wounded – all slightly – 1 officer, 18 other ranks. The whole show went off very satisfactorily and information came in splendidly, both frequently and accurately.\n","1002":"\n\nSnatched 3 hours sleep during the day, and completed arrangements for second raid. Again very successful though the Boche made a stout resistance. In consequence we brought out no prisoners, but actually accounted for over 40 killed and very many wounded including the occupants of six dugouts. These men refused to come out so were bombed. Two light machine guns were captured.\n\nOur losses, 1 officer killed, 3 men killed, 1 officer wounded, 21 men wounded, all but four being very slight. In each of the above raids I employed a total of 300 all ranks. All are much bucked at the results.\n","1003":"\n\nRaiding parties clearing up in their camps. With Brigade Major I visited them. They are all in splendid spirit. Advance parties from 6th Brigade arrived to reconnoitre positions. Prepared Honors and Awards for officers and men who did best work in the raids. Visit from Representatives of British Press.\n","1004":"\n\nAt 10.30 AM Gen. Birdwood presented twenty four Military Medal ribbons to selected NCOs and men as immediate reward for good work in raids. Col. Milne had a nice ceremonial parade arranged with his captured machine guns and rifles, much in evidence. Later General Birdwood addressed the parade.\n\nI then accompanied General Birdwood round the front line four sector, or rather the support line. He took with him Messrs. Murdoch and Gilmore Australian Press representatives. We visited both line Battalion Commanders and Ultimo Crater. During the afternoon the 15\" of Heavy Artillery destroyed the famous Warneton Tower, which has for so long been used by the Boche as an O.P.\n","1005":"\n\nIn morning with the Divisional Commander inspected my Brigade Group Transport as it marched along the Ballieul Road. It made a splendid showing and the Divisional Commander was very enthusiastic about it. In afternoon Gen. Paton, 6th Brigade with his staff arrived at our forward Brigade HQrs. Our two rear Battalions were relieved during the day and the remainder of Brigade units at night, relief being completed and command passing about 11 PM.\n\nDivision provided us with a car and we reached our temporary HQrs. at midnight.\n","1006":"\n\nVisited DHQ and had a conference with G.O.C. re training, destruction of property etc. He then handed over to G.O.C. 2nd Aus Div and left for Nielle Blequin. With my staff I watched entraining of Battalions at Steenwerck and then with them journed by rail to Desvres. Division had arranged for a car to meet me there, and we arrived at our new HQrs. about 8.30. A fine old Chateau at Henneveux.\n","1007":"\n\nPer car visited all Battalions. I found them settling down comfortably and generally well satisfied with their billets. Called at Division and signed sundry papers. The Divisional Commander left on 3 weeks leave to the South of France, and from to day I assume command until I too go on leave about the 17th inst. Our HQrs. are so pleasant and comfortable that I have decided not to move to Divisional HQrs. during my period as GOC Division.\n","1008":"\n\nMotored to Division and dealt with sundry papers. Then on to Belgian Hospital at GUEMPS near Calais, and No. 2 Australian General Hospital at Wimereux. Here I saw Matron Grey and Col. Powell.

Unfortunately Col. Goddard forgot I was coming and commenced the demonstration before time. Major Weik also came too late. Rode on afterwards to 33rd Battalion. Found Col. Morshead just about to have a game of tennis. I joined in tho’ wearing ordinary boots. Arrangements complete for my visit to Cap Martin.\n","1014":"\n\nDuring morning attended smoke demonstration on 33rd Battalion ground. Both 33rd and 34th Battalions present. Quite an excellent illustration of what can be done by smoke in masking every strong point. Afterwards had three sets of tennis with Col. Morshead. In afternoon a party of nurses from No. 2 Australian General Hospital, Wimereux visited us at Brigade HQrs. They were accompanied by Col. Powell who commands the Hospital, Matron Gray and two Padres. Our Field Ambulance vehicles brought them along and took them back at 5 PM The massed bands of the Battalions played for us and our Mess Secretary had arranged a very nice \"afternoon tea\". I think the nurses all thoroughly enjoyed their afternoon.\n","1015":"\n\nAttended to a few matters prior to going on leave. Sent water colour sketches over to London for Lt. Benson, in order to help his application for appointment as an official artist to A.I.F. Left Bde H Qrs. at 5.30 PM for No. 8 British Red Cross Hospital at \n\nBoulogne. I find I must enter as a patient and will not leave here for Cap Martin till Tuesday morning 19th inst. Many restrictions, must have all meals at the Hospital, breakfast at 7.30 must be in room, cannot go out till seen by the M.Officer. Must be in by 6.30 PM in evening, must be in bed at 9.30 PM. Plenty of \"musts\". However the Hospital appears to be well run and discipline must take its part. Capts. Dixon and Paterson came down with me, and rather enjoyed my discomfiture at the multitudinous regulations.\n","1016":"\n\nAfter breakfast and while waiting for the M. officer I watched sea planes being launched from the Hangars and going off on their allotted tasks. My ward is on the 6th Floor and has a magnificent view of the whole Harbour and coast line.\n\nBefore and after lunch I had a nice walk along the foreshore. A Boche plane was overhead about 2.30 PM and anti aircraft guns had a great time until eventually he was driven off. The Harbour is really very interesting – Hydroplanes, boats, Destroyers, trawlers and innumerable other craft. Informed we leave about 6.30 tomorrow morning for Cap Martin via Amiens-Paris-Lyons and Marseilles. A very nice piano here and two young subalterns who play magnificently have been entertaining us.\n","1017":"\n\nBreakfast at 5.30 AM Caught train for Parisat 7.30 AM Party all told 16 in number, 3 Colonels and myself travelled together and had a few games of cards while on the journey. Lunched at Amiens, and arrived in Parisabout 4.30 PM One of the Colonels found his wife awaiting him. She is coming to live at Menton while her husband is at Cap Martin. Dined with them and a New Zealand Colonel at Gare Du Lyon, Paris. In the afternoon took the Underground Railway to the Opera House and spent half an hour in the centre of Paris. I should have mentioned that the British Red Cross Authorities provided motors for our party at Gare du Nord to take us to Gare Du Lyon. Boarded Menton train at 7.30 PM and left Parisat 8.15 PM. Arrangements had been made for \"couchettes\" for eight senior officers so I personally had a very comfortable night. Train a very fine one indeed.\n","1018":"\n\nPassed Lyons about 4.30 AM, and reached Marseilles about 11.30 AM Breakfast at 7.30 AM and lunch at 11 AM. The Rhone Valley is exceedingly pretty and at the present time so gay with fruit tree blossoms. The villages and towns en route remind me very much of Cairo and Alexandria or rather one realises how much of French influence and character there is in the two towns referred to. \n\nFrom Toulon the journey along the Riviera is intensely interesting. While the coastal scenery and mountain effects are not one whit better than much of our Australian country, yet the vivid colouring of the water and the distinctive character of the valleys and towns together with the sub-tropical foliage and paten life makes the whole ensemble very pleasant to look upon. From the railway one gets a fair general view of water scape and land scape, something of Cannes, Nice, Monaco, Monte Carlo and finally Menton which latter place we reached at 8.30 PM, one hour late. The latter part of the journey in particular was very tiring tho’ a few games of bridge helped to relieve us. It was raining rather heavily when we reached our destination. Cars were waiting for us to take us to Cap Martin Convalescent Home – and at 9.30 PM we sat down to a very nice and much appreciated dinner. I have a magnificent room (with Bath and Sitting room adjoining) overlooking the blue Mediterranean. To bed at 10.30 PM dead tired.\n\nThursday 21st March\n\nA treat to have a fine hot bath. Breakfast at 8.30 AM after which I made my \"bow\" to the Commandant and listened to his words of wisdom concerning regulations etc. Then at 10 AM I reported to the Doctor under whose care I am. He duly sounded me and reports my lungs quite sound. Possibly I may need three weeks here. Gen. Hart (late of 4th N.Z. Brigade is here together with two other Generals and we four have a table allotted to us. At 10.30 Gen. Hart and myself walked to Menton, he to make a call, and for myself to call on General Monash who is staying at the Regina Place Hotel. He was not in so I left a note for him.\n\nWalked back to the Home in time for lunch. Quite a pleasant stroll along the Esplanade. After lunch I thoroughly reconnoitred the grounds surrounding the Home and walked along the\n\nCoad Cliff track almost to Monte Carlo. A delightful walk this rugged pine clad country. Many fine villas here overlook the ocean. The Home itself is a very fine pile – accommodating about 180 officers with necessary staffs. The Dining room I understand will seat about 500. Thoroughly enjoyed afternoon tea at 4.30 PM I really felt very tired after my morning and afternoon strolls. Played bridge with our party of Generals till 11 PM\n\nFriday 22nd March\n\nCalled on General Monash at his Hotel MentonE at 10.45 AM. With him took train to Monte Carlo. Had lunch at the Cafe de Parisand afterwards spent a very enjoyable hour in looking round the town. Specially visiting the Casino, Opera House, looking in at the Gaming Tables, and generally admiring and criticizing Architecture and Gardens. I was exceedingly interested to find that the fine vista between the Casino and the Bank is flanked with palms and trees most of which came from Australia. I refer especially to Cabbage Tree palms, Currajong and Moreton Bay figs. Also, I have seen quite a number of fine specimens of Australian eucalyptus. \n\nAt 2.30 PM we boarded the rack and pinion railway leading from Monte Carlo to La Turbie. The ascent is very steep and the highest point reached is about feet. Leaving the town of La Turbie we walked to the Grand Corniche route and thence westwards for about 3 kilometres. Then taking a short cut down the hill side to the lower Corniche road we reached the interesting old village of Eze. We walked through it till we finally reached the old keep at the summit. From this point there is a magnificent panorama extending for the full 360°. We then walked down a well graded track to the seaside, about 3 kilometres, and took train back to Monte Carlo, then changed and continued the journey back to the Hotel. One gets a fine view of Monaco while coming through and later I shall hope to inspect the Museum and the Prince’s palace. Generally the mountains and gorges are very interesting, much terracing everywhere, and much cultivation of vines and olive trees, also lemons. The Harbour works at Monaco and in fact all engineering work in the district in the way of viaducts, bridges, roads, etc. impress one as being of excellent design and construction. Altogether a very interesting day and full of pleasure and not the least being conversation on many topics with General Monash.\n\nSaturday 23rd March\n\nThe Boche seem to have commenced their long talked of attack on a front of about 60 miles. Here one can get no details. This morning I spent in the grounds of the Hotel and after lunch walked on towards Monte Carlo calling at the Villa Roquiek where Australian nurses have a rest home. Both the Matron and all the nurses were out. Stayed at the Hotel during afternoon. Immediately after dinner I received a wire ordering my immediate recall so it has been decided that General Monash and myself return together tomorrow morning. As usual my luck is out – my leave seems further than ever from realisation.\n\nSunday 24th March\n\nWith General Monash left Menton at 10.15 AM Had a very comfortable journey.\n\nMonday 25th March\n\nArrived at Parisat 9.15 AM. Generals ADC at the Station with car. Had breakfast etc. in town and left at 10.30 for the Division. Parisgreatly excited because of German long range shelling, estimated at 120 kilometres. Arrived at Amiens at 2 PM. Passed many refugees between Beauvais and Amiens. Many wounded passing through the latter town. Had an excellent lunch at the E.F.C. officers club, then motored on to Doullens. Ascertained the Division was about to move here so I decided to remain and endeavour to prepare the way for my Brigade. Motored out to Mondicourt and established a Brigade HQrs. in a Chateau in the town. Succeeded in getting a decent billet and a good night’s rest. Our Bde. advance Parties (including Halford) arrived at Doullens today and is now with me here. Brigade due to arrive tomorrow.\n\nTuesday 26th March\n\n10th Brigade first to arrive entraining at Mondicourt. At about 11 AM alarmist reports came in the Boche cavalry were in the village of Colincamps, and then commenced what can only be described as a disgraceful withdrawal. When military forces retire of course the civilians did the same – and very soon Mondicourt was deserted, the inhabitants having simply walked out and left everything behind them. At this juncture I heard my Brigade was arriving at Doullens so motored down in a train car and joined the Battalion, giving all the information\n\nI could. Unit then commenced their march to Mondicourt. I rode ahead with CO 33rd and 34th Battalions to Henu where they were to be billeted and established an outpost line – the real front line was some three miles Eastward and held by British troops. The two Battalions above mentioned reached Henu at Dusk – and the 35th Battn. later in the night marched into and billeted at Famechon. Machine Gun Co. at Couin.\n\nWednesday 27th March \n& 28th March\n\nDuring the night orders were received that Brigade was to be bussed to Franvilles on the Amiens-Albert road. Accordingly orders were issued and the Convoy of 160 Busses left Famechon at 7.45 AM and reached FranVillers at 9.45 AM The 10th and 11th Brigades had preceded us to the same destination – and had been ordered to go at once into the line holding from Sailly Le Sec to Mericourt while the 9th Brigade went into Reserve in open fields north West of Heilly. The 33rd and 34th Battalions were later ordered to take over the line from Mericourt to Amiens Road, but had barely completed the move before the Brigade was ordered to move to Bonnay and hold a defensive flank along the Somme. The 36th Battalion had not yet arrived from Doullens so 35th Battalion was ordered to move at once (about 8 PM) and hold a line from Sailly Le Sec to main roadway through Corbie, while 33rd Battalion was ordered to hold line from main roadway through Corbie to Aubigny, the role of the Brigade being to prevent the enemy from crossing the Somme and from taking Corbie. The 36th Battalion arriving before midnight and bivouacked just north of Bonnay, while 34th Battalion moved into Bonnay.\n\nThursday 28th March\n\nCalled at Division and discussed many matters. Brigade HQrs. established at Bonnay at 9.30 AM Here also are HQrs. of 34th, 35th, 36th Battns, Machine Gun Co. & T.M. Battery, also a cyclist company attached to us from Corps, 33rd Battn. HQrs. in La Neuville with advanced HQrs. at Corbie. Made a personal reconnaissance of our line, called on and established liaison with 1st Cavalry Division and 16th Division whose HQrs. are at Fouilloy. It is pitiable to see the evacuation of the civil population. As an instance the morning of our arrival at FranVillers I saw an old man of over 70 years wheeling away his old wife of similar years in a wheelbarrow, and just a few of their most treasured possessions with them also in the barrow.\n\nFriday 29th March\n\nLast evening while at dinner I received word from General Monash that my Brigade was to be detached from the Division and move southward. Later however he cancelled the order. Today I have again been all round my front and in liaison with 7th Cav. & 16th Division. This evening we again received orders to move south – this time definite – and to proceed to Cachy reporting to HQrs. 61st Division at Gentelles. Our Field Ambulance and Train Company are to accompany us. Leading Battalion left Bonnay about 8 o’clock and arrived at Cachy about 11 PM All units complete arrived during the night. I reported to Gen. MacKenzie, 61st Div. at Gentelles and established Brigade HQrs. in this village. British troops very pleased to see us.\n\nSaturday 30th March\n\nArranged for all troops to evacuate Cachy during the day to avoid casualties from shell fire. They accordingly moved northward about 1000 yards to the edge of a wood. At 2.15 I was ordered by GOC 61st Division to counter attack and re-establish the line immediately West of Marcelcave to Aubercourt inclusive. I immediately proceeded to the Battalions called the COs together and ordered the 33rd Battn. to carry out the attack with 34th Battalions in support. The 12th Lancers (of 2nd Cavalry Division) about 400 strong protected our flank and assisted us in a splendid manner. Though my troops did not reach their final objective as laid down they drove the enemy back and established a splendid line. I received a very kind note of appreciation from the GOC 61st Division. Our casualties were officers killed 5, officers wounded, 5, OR killed 28, OR wounded 157, missing, 11 ORs, Total 217.\n\nThe 33rd Battalion was relieved by troops of the 18th Division during the night. We captured 4 prisoners and two machine guns. No more prisoners were needed. The 35th Battalion during the night took over from","1019":" Cavalry Division the line just West of Marcelcave to just West of Abancourt. This was done to give an opportunity for fragments of units to withdraw and be reorganised. \n","1020":" During the night 61st Division handed over Command of Sector to","1021":" Div.

Morshead and heard his story of the counter attack, then on to the C.O. of the 35th Battalion and satisfied myself that all was well on his part of the line. During the afternoon Cachy and Gentelles shelled with 5.9. About 24 casualties in 34th Battn. in Cachy. Here shells landed round our HQrs. and concussion of bursting shell smashed our windows but we suffered no casualties. My Brigade still reserved for counter attack work. Situation just south of us not very satisfactory this afternoon and there seemed at one time a possibility that my troops might be required. However the 54th Bde. of this Division was moved to the threatened point and we were not required.

During the day the remainder of 61st Division troops on our front were withdrawn. \n\nEnemy shelled Cachy and Gentelles again this afternoon with 5.9\" Our battalions now living in huts and in the open away from the village of Cachy. Instructions given late tonight regarding the construction of a switch line in front of Gentelles and Cachy. The enemy appears now to be held on this front. This afternoon we watched him attacking south East of Hangard in solid formation, but the artillery got on to him, drove him back in disorder and caused him heavy casualties. It is interesting to note the composition of Carey’s force relieved by us on the night 30th March. They included elements of 216 A.T. Coy. RE, 253 Tunnelling Co., III Corps School, No. 1 RE Battn. XIX Corps, Canadian Machine Gun Corp., No. 4 Workshop Co. RE, No. 2 Canadian Railway Battalion, 144, 213, 217, 353, A.T. Coy. RE, 5th Army Infantry School, 5th Army Musketry School, XIX Corps School, U.S.A. Troops, 5th Army Signals – Total as at March 26th of about 3000.\n","1030":"\n\nDuring the morning visited C.O. 35th Battalion and Col. Adams commanding the Artillery covering my front. Discussed fully all details as between Gunmen and Infantry. Later called on General \n\nCRA to 18th Division. With him discussed the necessity for the provision of Liaison Officers from Heavy Artillery to live with FA Groups, thus ensuring prompt action against targets beyond the range of Field Artillery. Discussed with Divisional Commander the proposed switch line and received instructions to get on with it at once. During afternoon in company with Bde. Major, COs of 34th and 36th Battalions and CO 9th Marchine Gun Co. I reconnoitred and fixed this line, and then got in touch with the C.R.A. for tools wire etc. Boche again shelling Cachy and Gentilles, causing several casualties in the latter town to 9th Field Ambulance personnel.\n\nThe 54th Brigade (18th Div.) improved its line north of Hangard as the result of a minor operation. The enemy put down a very heavy barrage on their part of the front and also south of Hangard. The French during the night took over northwards from British as far as and including Hangard.\n\nWednesday 3rd April\n\nIn the morning in company with Bde. Major visited the new switch line and found all units had work well in hand. I then went on to Villers Bretonneux to HQrs. of 35th and 33rd Battalions. Arranged for 35th Battn. to use all companies in the front line, while 33rd will be responsible for construction of support line. The 33rd Battn. is providing a party of 50 NCOs and men under Major Hunt of 35th Battalion as a picket for the town. Australian Corps Provost Staff and 1st Cavalry Division also providing personnel. The condition of this and every other town through which our British troops have returned is too awful for words. Looting and drunkenness has been the order of the day and in my opinion have been directly the cause of so much falling back. We are trying our best to straighten up the towns again but it is a Herculean task. General Monash called about noon but unfortunately I missed him, not having returned from front areas. Heavy Artillery Liaison Officer now located with Field Artillery Group and Infantry in Villers Bretonneux. We have thus established a record for the war. I have never known it to be done previously and we can now arrange for fleeting targets beyond range of field guns to be taken on immediately.\n\nThursday 4th April\n\nWe were all roused at 5.15 by heavy enemy shelling which extended right along the Divisional front as well as southward and northward. At 6.15 the enemy attacked our Brigade front and simultaneously north and south of us. Reports from my 35th Battalion stated they had beaten off the attack inflicting heavy casualties on the Boche,\n\nand that they feel quite capable of dealing with any further attacks. Soon afterwards I was informed that the 74th Division on my left Flank had fallen back under enemy pressure, and to ensure a continuous line I had to fall back my left flank in concert with them. Later in the day the British troops on my right of 18th Division also gave way and I was again forced to fall back a flank, this time my Right, to maintain touch. At this stage the enemy pressure was very great and the situation somewhat critical. Under orders from 19th Corps my responsibility was to hold Villers Bretonneux, so I had moved up two battalions for counter attack purposes – the 34th immediately north and the 36th immediately south of the town. I should have noted that the 35th held our original front line and the 33rd were in support.\n\nAbout 5 PM the enemy reached the southern outskirts of the town and the 36th Battn. was launched in counter attack. In brilliant fashion they did their job, drove the enemy back, captured 6 machine guns and 3 prisoners (the conditions making it impossible to deal with numbers of prisoners) and re-established the line. All the evening our Lecor’s guns and the captured machine guns caused heavy casualties to the massing enemy and when night fell our positions remained intact. I personally went forward at dusk, saw a good deal of the line and then conferred with all C.Os., reallotted the front to three Battalions, 33rd on left, 34th in centre and 36th on Right, while the 35th was ordered to withdraw and re-organise in support. During the night I ordered an advance of about 1000 yards to resecure our old support line trenches. This was done successfully, about 50 enemy being killed and 19 prisoners taken. The casualties to the enemy are estimated conservatively at 4,000. Our casualties were as follows:-\n\nBtns. – Officers Killed – Officers Wounded – O.R. Killed – O.R. Wounded – O.R. Missing\n\n33 – nil – 3 – 7 – 75 – nil\n\n34 – nil – 5 – 20 – 100 – nil\n\n35 – 3 – 6 – 43 – 191 – 44\n\n36 – 4 – 8 – 26 – 106 – 1\n\nM.Gun Co. – nil – 1 – 1 – 13 – 4\n\nALTMB. – nil – nil – nil – nil – nil\n\nTotal – 661\n\nTroops of 15th Australian Brigade and also 5 Aus. Brigade have arrived in this locality. Some of our Bde H Qrs. killed during the bombardment this morning, including my best horse. My second has been evacuated sick, so I am now without any animal. Villers Bretonneux sadly damaged by enemy shell fire. Called at Division at BOVE, also 9th Field Ambulance. Reached my H.Q. 3.15 AM, 5th.\n\nFriday 5th April\n\nSituation this morning quiet. During the day enemy commenced to mass along our front but from our excellent positions we caused him heavy casualties, estimated at 1000, as a result of combined fire of rifles and Lecon guns etc. All day long there were indications of enemy attack, so on my putting up the case the 19th Corps ordered 5th A.I. Bde. (Gen. Smith) to place 2 Battalions to support me for counter attack work, and if not used, to relieve my line during the night. These troops were not required and relief (excepting one Co. of 36th) was completed during the hours of darkness. Two Battns., the 33rd and 34th are being held on a close position of readiness to assist if necessary in counter attack for protection of Villers Bretonneux. General Smith took over also from British Troops of 18th Division and now holds as far south as Hangard where he joins the French. Gen. Hobbs today established his HQrs. in the village and holds from main Amiens road at Villers Bretonneux to the Somme while 3rd and 4th Aus. Divs. hold up to Albert. Thus the lines of approach to Amiens are controlled by Australian troops who hold about 15 miles of front and are the right of the British line.\n\nRepresentatives from 4th Army, 19th Corps and GHQ called during the day and congratulated the Brigade on the success of the operations of yesterday.\n","1031":"\n\nHave not yet been able to get detailed report prepared of operations on 4th & 5th insts. Battalions have not yet sent me their reports. Both 33rd and 34th Battalions have secured accommodation in huge factory cellars in Villers Bretonneux and will thus escape inclement weather. \nCapt. Pike and Capt. Moss\n Col. Jackson called from 3rd Aus. Division in order to see if we wanted anything. Canteen stores arrived from Division and were much appreciated. At night 17th & 18th Battalion AIF relieved by 175th Brigade and my counter attack battalions also relieved from their duty. Front quiet. Capt. Bushell killed tonight.\n","1032":"\n\nConference with C.Os. at Villers Bretonneux at 10 AM. Urged necessity of submitting reports of operations at once also list of casualties. These arrived during the afternoon and were collated and Brigade report prepared therefrom. This was sent to many outside formations for information and to the 3rd Cavalry Division I forwarded a letter of appreciation concerning the work of 1st Dragoon guards & 17th Lancers.\n\nCapt. Pike and Capt. Moss from 3rd Aus Div called to assist us in any way possible. Draft report of operations sent by Capt. Pike to General Monash. The 35th Battalion is now also accommodated in cellars in Villers Bretonneux with the 33rd and 34th. I hope to accommodate the 36th in a similar manner.\n\nMonday 8th April\n\nA quiet day generally, tho’ this morning there was heavy artillery fire on the French front on our right. Major Pain went forward to see Battalions and select forward Brigade Station in case we again go into the line as appears now to be possible. Australian Corps now established on the sector and comes under 4th Army. I expect the Corps southern boundary will be Hangard and the northern boundary in the vicinity of Buire. Major King from","1033":" Aus Div and Dados called re equipment, stores, clothing etc. Prepared recommendation for immediate honors and awards to Officers NCOs and men of 33rd and 34th Battalions in connection with counter attack operations on 30th March. Informed by 18th Division that two of my Battalions would tomorrow night go into the line from Hangard midway to Villers Bretonneux.\n\nMiserable wet day. The 5th Aus. Brigade and 175th Brigade are tomorrow morning early to advance their line to the old front East of what we know as Lancer Wood.\n","1034":"\n\nOperation intended for this morning postponed till approximately 13th inst. in order to permit of French co-operation on South. Brigade Major and myself called on GOC 5th Aus. Inf. Bde. and arranged details of relief tonight of 34th and 36th Battalions. GOC 18th Division called and in detail gave me the nature of proposed operations on 13th inst. and the role of this Brigade on that date as Divisional Reserve.\n\nBoche shelling a good deal during the day and towards evening sent over some gas shell. London \"Times\" of yesterday’s date gives an interesting column to the work of the Cavalry during the recent fighting and incidentally refers to our working with and appreciation for the Cavalry.\n\nRelief by 34th and 36th Battalions carried out, and 33rd & 35th Battalions also 9th Aus. Machine Gun Co. and Trench Mortar Battery become Divisional Reserve and will remain for the present located in stray cellars on the north West corner of Villers Bretonneux.\n\nWednesday 10th April\n\nReceived instructions from 18th Div. to provide one Battalion for immediate garrison and defence of Villers Bretonneux. I have therefore instructed Lt. Col. Morshead to so employ his Battalion and have given him the 9th ALTM Battery and 2 Sections of 9th M.Gun Co. He himself becomes O.C. defences Villers Bretonneux and comes directly under the orders of GOC 18th Division, tho’ as GOC 58th Division will in a few days take over the line Col. Morshead is to carry out the works policy in accordance with the latter ideas. The 35th Battalion and 9th Machine Gun Co. (less 2 Sections) remains Divisional Reserve.\n\nDuring morning in company with 2nd in Command 35th Battalion reconnoitred position for Divisional Reserve to occupy during forthcoming operations. Capt. Suter went up to Hazebrouck with a party from 3rd Aus Div HQrs. to arrange re moving records back.\n\nHeard this evening that the Boche had attacked north and south of Armentieres. On the south he had reached Estaires and BAC St. MUR, while on the north he had pushed in to Messines ridge and Ploegsteert Wood. A counter attack by 19th Division drove him back on the north.\n","1035":"\n\nAttended conference at 18th Div HQrs re forthcoming operations now decided for morning of 14th instant. Cleared up situation regarding definite role and powers of C.O. Villers Bretonneux. Lt. Larke & Halford went to Hazebrouck re kit etc. and if possible will endeavour to get some of my belongings from the cellar at Sternwerck Chateau. However our line runs now so close to this town that I am afraid they will be unsuccessful. Capt. Suter returned from Hazebrouck. He succeeded in sending all Brigade records and some officers kits (including my own) back to Desvres. The 1st Australian Division also British Cavalry moved northward today and I expect we shall soon hear of them being hotly engaged. This front quiet yesterday tho’ further south on the French front we could hear heavy artillery fire. Much aerial activity on both sides. The HQrs. 5th Aus Div have moved to BUSSY on the north side of the river. Amiens now deserted. All civilians evacuated. \n\nThe 58th Division (Gen. Cator) will take over the sector in a few days, and judging from a letter I have received from General Monash the prospects of our early rejoining the 3rd Division are not very hopeful. The 3rd Div. anticipates having to hold its present line indefinitely.\n","1036":"\n\nThis morning the Boche made a strong attack on the French at HANGUARD affecting my right Battalion the 36th. Orders came through from 18th Division about 9 AM to move the 35th Battn. and machine gun Co. from Villers Bretonneux to a position of readiness near Gentelles Wood. Later in the day I received word that a 5.9 shell had struck the HQrs. dugout of 36th Battalion, that Lt. Col. Milne and his Adjutant Capt. McFee were killed and that Major McDowell, second in command was seriously wounded. Major Fry from 34th Battn. was placed temporarily in command of 36th until I could send down Major Grant from 35th Battn. and Major Dunlop to act as Adjutant. Spoke to Division about the question of command. General Monash later came to see me and as a result of my recommendations Major Fry will remain in command of 34th Battn. and Major White second in command of 33rd, will command 36th Battn. both with temporary rank of Lieut. Colonel. Very sorry indeed to lose Colonel Milne. A brave and courageous as well as capable officer and one whose place it will be difficult to adequately fill. At this juncture we cannot spare officers of any rank, let alone senior officers. Since 29th March when we arrived in this area my losses in officers have been as follows – Killed 13, died of wounds 2, wounded 31 – Total 46 – nearly all as the result of machine gun fire. During the night the 36th Battalion was relieved and moved back to Bois de Blangy. The 34th Battalion was also withdrawn from the line but at present is held as a counter attack battalion in close support to front line Battalions. The 35th Battalion and 9th Machine Gun Co. remained in Bivouac in a position of readiness as Divisional Reserve just north of Gentelles Wood. A great deal of artillery fire during the night and an abundance of enemy bombing – sounding in the direction of Corbie.\n\nSaturday 13th April\n\nCalled at Divisional HQrs. (58th Div.) at Glisy. It is decided that 9th Bde. shall remain as Divisional Reserve for some few days and will occupy the Bove-Blangy line. Rode round Battalions with Bde. Major and allotted definite areas. The 34th came right out of the line this evening. The 36th evidently did exceedingly well on the afternoon and evening of 12th. Operations intended for 14th further postponed this time indefinitely. GOC 58th Division assumed command of sector from 18th Division at 3 PM today.\n\nSunday 14th April\n\nRode round Battalion bivouacs. Majors Fry and White definitely appointed by Corps to command 34th and 36th Battalions respectively with temporary rank in each case of Lieut. Colonel.\n\nCalled at Divisional HQrs., arranged about ordnance supplies etc. We are definitely for those services to come under 58th Division.\n\nArranged details for move of Brigade HQrs. to tents in copse T32 central and signals instructed to connect up all Battalions.\n\nLate in the evening received word that on 15th inst. my Brigade is to mann the Reserve line – Gentelles-Bois L-Abbe. This cancels previous instructions that we were to be on Bove-Blangy line for some days. About the 19th inst. I am to take over Left Sector of Divisional front.\n\nNews from the north indicates that the Boche is now held up. It would appear that the advent of Cavalry Divisions and 1st Australian Division has had the desired affect. The Boche will be rather non-plussed – realising that simultaneously with having his march on Amiens barred by Australian troops, he still has Australian troops opposite him on the Ballieul line. Miserable drizzling wet day and bitterly cold.\n\nMonday 15th April\n\nMet C.Os. of Battalions at Bois L-Abbe, told them the location of the units in the Reserve line from which they are to take over – and they moved off to their respective areas making necessary arrangements for relief tonight. Visited new tunnelled Brigade H.Quarters in railway cutting Bois L-Abbe which we will occupy in a few days. They will be quite comfortable and at the same time secure from shell fire and bombs. Battalions moved to new locations and completed reliefs about 8 PM. Much night shelling by both enemy and ourselves.\n\nTuesday 16th April\n\nWith Brigade Major visited all Battalions. Told them off to their sectors when I take over the line so that the necessary reconnaissance may be made by all officers. Lunched with CO 33rd Battalion at Villers Bretonneux. He has the defences of the town well organised. Later visited the very fine Chateau in the town. Splendidly furnished and fitted with a wealth of carving it is a charming home. Grounds and flower beds well laid out, hyacinth, tulips and other bulbous plants in bloom – a fine aviary covering about ¼ acre – with all kinds of birds etc. all being gradually demolished by enemy shell fire. Ruthless destruction\n\nand one cannot help being dominated by a feeling of revenge against the country and the people who were responsible for the dreadful war. Called at new Brigade HQrs. on my return journey. They will be ready for occupation by us on 19th inst. Called on Colonel Erskine commanding the Artillery Group covering our front. Arranged working parties for tonight to bring cable from new Bde H Qrs. to connect with line Battalions.\n\nUpon my return to HQrs. met Gen. Cator GOC 58th Division who informed me our arrangements for taking over the line on 19th inst. cancelled and that on 20th inst. my Brigade would return to 3rd Aus Div and bivouac temporarily to Camon and Lamotte near Amiens. I presume we shall have two or three days in which to bathe and generally clean up the men and then take over part of 3rd Aus. Division front. Tho’ we have had an interesting time here we shall be glad to rejoin our own Division. Dined with Divisional Commander near Boves at Fort Manoir.\n\nAppreciated letter received from French General concerning assistance of British troops including our 9th Brigade. Charley transferred to RAN and appointed to HMAS Melbourne. Work on buried cable route not very satisfactory owing to delay in bringing up tools and to an insufficient number of men.\n\nWednesday 17th April\n\nBoche shelled Villers Bretonneux very heavily in the morning and again in the afternoon with gas shell of all calibres. At the same time he also gassed Bois L-Abbe. Altogether he put in about 8000 rounds into the town and 4,000 in the wood. As a result he casualted practically the whole of a British Battalion held for counter attack work and every Brigade he caused casualties to 11 officers and over 300 other ranks with more still being evacuated. The 33rd particularly in the town had a very bad time indeed. As a result of these casualties I had to push up my 35th Battalion for counter attack purposes and also send up one company of 36th to reinforce the 33rd in the town. Working parties on burying of cable had therefore to be abandoned, tho’ I had hoped to have it all finished before leaving the Sector.\n\nDuring the morning Gen. Haig commanding 24th Battn. of 8th British Division called to see me. He is to take over the Villers Bretonneux front on night 19th-20th April. Gen. Grogan commanding 23rd Bde. of same Division will on the night 20th\/21st take over from my Battalion in Villers Bretonneux. Strangely enough I took over from this Brigadier at Brune Gaye in December last.\n\nThursday 18th April\n\nAgain the enemy has shelled with gas and we have suffered further casualties in the Brigade including 7 more officers. The officers comprise Col. Morshead and his Adjutant, and the 33rd Battn is now exceedingly weak. I have therefore sent forward the 36th less one company to take over from 33rd. Col. White becomes Commandant of the town and the remains of the 33rd have been taken out by motor lorries to Bove where they are being billeted, bathed and fitted out with fresh clothing while their own is being fumigated.\n\nGeneral Montgomery, M.G. General Staff to Gen. Rawlinson called to see me, expressed his thanks for the work of the Brigade in the sector which has been very valuable and much appreciated, and his regrets at our heavy casualties from gas. The Army Commander has evidently been pleased with our work. Staff of 58th Division doing all they can to help us re bathing, billets and clothing.\n\nMajor Grant placed temporarily in command of 33rd Battalion. \n\nDivision informed of our total casualties.\n\nDuring the day I called on General Monash and arranged with him details of our move into his area and our location therein. All satisfactorily fixed up. Bde H Qrs. will be at Frechencourt.\n\nBattle up north appears to be now more or less Stationary, and our troops reinforced by French appear to have held the enemy up.\n\nEnemy bombing continuously during the night. No damage at Blangy-Tronville.\n\nFriday 19th April\n\nAdvanced parties of 23rd Bde. 8th Division called re new relief. Col. Anderson Morshead (a connection of our Col. Morshead) is to take over the defences of Villers Bretonneux while his G.O.C., General Grogan, will take over our HQrs. at Blangy-Tronville. Strangely enough I took over from Gen. Grogan at Brune-Gaye at the end of last year.\n\nHeard today that Major Garling, 4th Aus. Div Arty had been killed in action.\n\nSaturday 20th April\n\nDuring the day the 34th and 35th Battalions were relieved in Bois L-Abbe – and marched to FranVillers and Lahoussoye respectively. \n\nAt night the 36th was relieved and at 11 PM commenced its march to Lahoussoye. Machine gunners are to be relieved tomorrow night and will then rejoin the M.G. Battalion and be billeted at Bonnay. The 9th F. Ambulance and train Co. both rejoined our 3rd Divisiion today. I formally handed\n\nover command of Villers Bretonneux at 12 midnight. Major Pain and myself then moved on to our new Head Qrs. at Frechencourt.\n\nSunday 21st April\n\nOur HQrs. are in a Chateau where also are billeted officers of 4th Aus Div Infantry. The building has been denuded of furniture and is far from being comfortable. We shall have to secure (or salve) enough furniture for our needs also a cooking stove. All units settling down in their new billets. The 33rd Battn. and trench mortar battery arrived from Bove today by motor lorry, so we are once again complete and with our Division. Halford accompanied me in a long walk over the country in search of Partridge and hares, and tho’ we saw a few of each we couldn’t get close enough to shoot them. I have the late Col. Milne’s gun.\n\nMonday 22nd April\n\nConference with Divisional Commander in morning re question of breaking up one battalion. He decided that if 500 NSW reinforcements could be supplied me during the next 2 weeks, we would keep to the four battalion organization. Otherwise the 36th Battalion will be broken up at once and the personnel distributed to the other battalions, the major portion going to 33rd Battalion. At 12.30 PM General Birdwood called for me and accompanied me to all Battalions, seeing the officers and men. On my return to Bde H Qrs. I learnt the Army Commander intended to call during the late afternoon and he arrived about 6 PM. He thanked me for the work of the Brigade while detached south. Major Hawley is being recalled from England and Major Blake is to take over his place.\n\nTuesday 23rd April\n\nIt has been decided that 4th Aus Div will relieve 3rd Aus Div in the line on night 24\/25th April. As the 4th Bde. of 4th Aus Div has not yet rejoined its Division my Brigade is to remain in its present location temporarily and be attached to Gen. Max Lagan as his Reserve Brigade. Much artillery action south of the Somme and prisoners state Boche is to make a big attack tomorrow morning. During tonight and the early hours of tomorrow all artillery is to engage in a big counter preparation programme. I shall be interested to see what happens in the Villers Bretonneux sector particularly.\n\nMajor Priestman and Col. Chateres called from Army HQrs. The latter whom I last met at Grantham is now Machine Gun adviser to 4th Army. Major Pain & myself dined with Gen. Max Lagan.\n\nWednesday 24th April\n\nThis morning the Boche attacked from Hangard to the Somme. With Villers Bretonneux as a centre he succeeded in driving back troops of 8th Division to the Bois L-Abbe. At this juncture the 13th Bde. of 4th Aus Div was ordered to move to Blangy-Tronville and I was ordered to have two Battalions ready to move at shortest notices to reinforce our own line or counter attack as might be necessary. The 5th Australian Division held its ground. Later in the day a Brigade of 8th Division in counter attack succeeded in driving the Boche out of BOIS D’AQUENNE into the town, but was held up by machine gun fire from further advance. The situation till evening remained as above with some parts of the line not definitely located. I saw today at Division HQrs. an interesting graph setting out the employment in various categories of the Brigade of the Division since its arrival in France. They are as follows –\n\nActual Battle – 9th Bde. 55 days – 10th Bde. 10 - 11th Bde. 50\n\nLine defence – 9th Bde. 191 days – 10th Bde. 245 - 11th Bde. 210\n\nRest or Reserve – 9th Bde. 250 days – 10th Bde. 240 -","1037":" Bde. 210\n\nThursday 25th April\n\nNews this morning shows that the 15th and","1038":" Australian Brigades have retaken Villers Bretonneux and re-established our former line. This is the third time Australian troops have saved this particular sector, and it seems a great pity that our fine men should be frittered away in retaking ground so consistently being lost by British troops.\n\nConference with Divisional Commander and O.C. Div. Signal Co., re transfers of men from Battalions to Sig. Service.\n\nInspected Transport during afternoon and arranged for horses to be exchanged with Artillery for mules. Major Blake went off to England.\n\nDined with Divisional Commander and \"A\" men this being Gallipoli day. It is hard to realise that three years have passed away since that eventful day. \n\nI have just had compiled total list of casualties while detached from the Division and operating south of the Somme.\n\nBattn. – Officers killed – Officers wounded – Officers gassed – O.Rs. killed – O.Rs. wounded – O.Rs. gassed – Missing\n\n33rd – 3 – 8 – 20 – 50 – 246 – 395 – 7\n\n34th – 1 – 7 – 1 – 33 – 181 – 27 – 17\n\n35th – 2 – 6 – 0 – 57 – 234 – 54 – 61\n\n36th – 7 – 3 – 4 – 36 – 164 – 60 – 3\n\n9th AMG.Co – 0 – 1 – 4 – 2 – 15 – 58 – 3\n\n9th ALTMB – 0 – 0 – 4 – 0 – 7 – 41 – 0\n\nTotal – 73 officers – 1750 other ranks\n","1039":"\n\nIt has now been decided that","1040":" Bde. will relieve","1041":" Bde. on the night 30th\/1st April and 1st\/2nd April, remaining in the line under normal circumstances for a period of 16 days then coming out for 8 days. Visited Transport during morning. Wrote Gen. Foote re tools for Brigade HQrs. tradesmen. Discussion with Divisional Commander re abolition of 36th Battalion and he endorsed my proposals which are to be referred to the Corps Cdr. for approval. American Engineer troops arrived at Frechencourt.\n","1042":"\n\nConferred with all Battalion Commanders re abolition of 36th Battalion and explained proposals.

Advised finally about relief of 11th Bde. though no orders have yet been issued by Division. Have decided to put 34th on the Right and 35th on the Left of the line. Necessary reconnaissance being made by officers of all Battalions. Called on General Cannam at Heilly and discussed with him details affecting his front. Had a look at new Brigade HQrs. being tunnelled through wall and high bank surrounding Heilly Chateau. When completed will make a very fine Head Quarters.\n","1044":"\n\nVery misty morning. Walked round the whole outpost line of the front we are to take over and am not quite satisfied. Will advance my line considerably as soon as possible after taking over. Called on Gen.

Told the CRE such was the case. Relief by 34th Battalion completed and command passed to me at about an hour after midnight. Have arranged mess and sleeping quarters in a small house close to the cellars which constitute the Infantry and Artillery offices. At last liaison good between gunners and Infantry. Saw General Birdwood while calling on Gen. McNicoll.\n","1049":"\n\nWith A\/BM and I.O. visited all three Battalion HQrs. also Flank Battalion C.O. of 8th Bde., and 8th Bde H Qrs. at Corbie.

Spoke to Divisional Commander re arrangements. A great deal of difficulty in securing necessary amount of pickets for wiring.\n\nFriday 3rd May\n\nDivisional Commander called during morning and discussed fully details for operations on 4th and 5th. Later went with him to see Gen. McNicoll on the same matter. The G.O.C. has allotted me certain working parties from the Pioneer Battn. Interview with CRE and CO 11th Field Co. re new Bde H Qrs. The 11th F. Coy. is to complete this work. Two Boche planes brought down in our area today. Used messenger dogs from Battalions to Brigade for first time. Dog took 33 minutes to bring a message 5000 yards. Discussed artillery programme for 5th inst. with Cra. Sent forward last night and tonight sufficient wire and pickets to do 2000 yards of double apron wiring.\n\nSaturday 4th May\n\nWent round the line and visited all Battalion HQrs. Discussed with Battalion Commanders proposals for operations on 4th and 5th insts. Visited Right Flank re new line of posts. Arranged that two companies of 33rd Battalion should take over Front line from 35th on night of 4th, thus leaving Col. Goddard’s command fire in his own hands to be used as he thought best.\n\nSunday 4th May\n\nSaturday 4th May\n\nBusy in the office all day. Prepared final instructions for tonight’s advance on front of Right Battalion. Called at 35th HQrs., and with Col. White and Major Dunlop visited Right Flank. We thoroughly reconnoitred the site for new posts and assisted the Pioneers and Infantry to tape out new posts. While taping out line for wire we three were faced by a party of 6 Boche – I called on them to halt, but they attempted to bolt off. Col. White and myself both used our revolvers each winging a Boche. The remainder excepting one promptly fell on their knees and put up their hands in token of surrender. The solitary one who eluded us ran into some of our men a little distance off and was captured. We took the remainder in hand, had the wounded men attended to and then walked off with our prisoners. The Battalion Commanders were highly amused to see their Brigadier bringing in his own \"Identification\", so urgently called for by Division. I reached my HQrs. at 6.30 AM on 5th inst.\n\nOur line of posts as intended was established.\n\nMonday 5th\n","1051":"\n\nOrders prepared for attack tonight by 35th Battalion and part of 34th on front north of Corbie Road. South of the Road the remainder of the 34th Battalion will swing up its left Flank to join our new line. Photos received today show that in front of us the Boche now has north of the Corbie Road, a complete front line and support line so our task is a bigger one than we at first anticipated. Lieut Halford joined 35th Bde H Qrs. before commencement of operations. At 11.45 PM Barrage opened and troops advanced successfully capturing the whole system and on the Right the 34th Battalion swung up its left. Heavy fighting took place on the extreme flanks of the objective. Altogether about 160 prisoners were captured including 3 officers, 9 machine guns and 2 T. Mortars. A Pioneer Company lent to the Brigade for the night consolidated the new front line and pushed out a number of Sap heads Td. As they were not ready to commence work till 12.30 they did excellently.\n\nTuesday 7th\n","1052":"\n\nEarly this morning we were inundated with Congratulatory messages on last night’s operations – from the Army, Corps and Divisional Commanders also from many friends in various Brigades. Gen. Plumer also sent a congratulatory wire. Much useful information was obtained from prisoners. At night 34th Battalion attempted to swing up its line on my extreme right but found the enemy system too strong to deal with, without artillery support. A scheme will be prepared for tomorrow night to secure the desired end.\n\nWednesday\n","1053":"\n\nConference at my HQrs. during morning with Gen. Tivey of 8th Brigade, my Group Commander and his. We discussed fully proposed advance tonight on my Right Flank, and after some difficulty persuaded Gen. Tivey as to objectives. Later however Gen. Hobbs decided to somewhat modify his objectives, not however materially our operations.\n\nDuring the day 34th Battn. had some difficulty with the Boche in their position in front line south of Corbie road, but T.Ms. dealt with the situation.\n\nMajor Pain went forward to 34th Battn. HQrs. to remain there during the show tonight. Zero hour at 11.30 PM. Succeeded in establishing our new line on the left but on our right we can get no information and this situation is obscure.\n\nWednesday 8th May\n\nThe right of our line not established last night, but as some officers and men are not accounted for it is presumed they are on the general line but not connected up. \nMajor\n Lieut. Fry very unwell and he is to go back to CCS for a rest. Gens. Birdwood, Monash, Cameron and Grimwade called about noon. To night Col. White attempted to definitely link up our right flank to 5th Aus Div, but owing to heavy machine gun fire and the darkness of the night he was unsuccessful. It must therefore be surmised that those officers and men unaccounted for on the previous night have either been killed or captured. As far as is at present known they total 4 officers and 10 other ranks.\n\nShelling of Heilly about 10 PM, driving us to our cellars.\n\nLast night we captured 8 prisoners, two being wounded in process of capture.\n\nThursday 9th May\n\nToday advanced parties of 5th Aus. Inf. Bde. (which is to relieve us came into the line. It now appears certain that 5 officers and about 62 men are missing from night of 7th May of which number the Boche claims 4 officers and 41 other ranks as prisoners. Our fellows must have been overwhelmed from a flank and must have fought well.\n\nWork at new Head Quarters progressing satisfactorily. Line of posts finally linked up on my right flank and with 5th Aus Div\n\nA great deal of artillery activity tonight on both sides. Enemy shelled Heilly and drove us all to take shelter in cellars.\n\nLondon papers contain many eulogistic references to our work of the last few nights.\n","1054":"\n\nOur HQrs. inundated to day by representatives of incoming units. General White also called in order to obtain first hand full details of our recent operations. Col. Allsop called during afternoon also Major Wootton. Spoke to Gen.

I handed over command of the sector at 4.30 AM.\n","1055":"\n\nBattalions came out of the line in early morning and all remained in the vicinity of Lahoussoye till about 11 AM, when they moved off leaving a few men behind whose feet were in such a condition as to prevent them marching. The 9th Field Ambulance brought them along. All units mounted passing lorries on their way to their allotted billetting area. Men very tired and foot sore. The last 8 days have been very strenuous indeed. I moved to our rear HQrs. at 9 AM and at 11.30 AM moved to Rivery, a suburb of Amiens.

Attack commenced at 3.10 AM and continued uninterruptedly till all Brigades had gained all objectives. Altogether the advance represents about 1½ miles in depth by 4 miles in breadth, and includes VAire Wood and village of Hamel.\n\nIt is not yet known definitely how many casualties our Corps has incurred but from my Division our casualties are under 200, with killed being only 2 officers and 39 other ranks.

Col. Sir Vincent Welch informed me most cases had gone on to CCS I therefore motored on another 16 kilometres and saw some 3 or 4 hundred Australian wounded from all Divisions engaged. The men were extraordinarily cheerful, and my later news concerning the final capture of all objectives with such a good bag of prisoners, delighted them all. Among the wounded I saw two young American Subalterns and a few privates. They spoke in glowing terms of their experience and were very proud to be wounded in such an action on the glorious 4th July.\n\nAll wounded spoke in high praise of the Artillery barrage given to them. Col. Martin promoted full Colonel and Temp. Brig. General. Had an interview with him and congratulated him. Lieut. Longstaff our official Artist presented me with a water colour sketch of Main Dressing Station Querrieu.\n\nReceived letter from Sir G.C. Wade, NSW.

Final figures not yet arrived at.\n","1083":"\n\nIn morning visited Transport lines of 7th Brigade.

All the Australian Divisional Commanders with the Brigadiers and officers taking part in the attack were presented to him and I personally had an interesting talk with him. The Army and Corps Commanders were also present. Later the President gave a very inspiriting and touching address to about 400 of the rank & file who had been in the battle. His remarks were warmly appreciated and when three cheers were called for France coupled with the name of the President, our Australian fellows gave full vent to their feelings.\n\nCorps Commanders discussed possible future operations with me. I am instructing my two line Brigadiers to do all they can under the present disorganised and demoralized condition of German defences to extend our front Eastward.\n\nMonday 8th July\n\nIn morning visited Transport lines of 6th Brigade to inspect Field guns, machine guns, trench mortars etc. captured by them on 4th inst.

Patrol of 7th Bde. during the day captured enemy front line system on western edge of Monument Wood and penetrated into the wood but were held up by snipers and machine guns. Hope to improve the line further during the night. Last night the 5th Brigade also advanced its line considerably and captured machine guns, range finders,\n\nminesweepers, rifles, etc., and killed a number of enemy. Gave Corps Commander full details by telephone at 5.20 PM so that he might give the Army Commander latest information at a conference held at 5.30 PM\n\nCalled on General Paton re amending his list of military medals for operations of 4th inst. He is very unwell, and is at once putting in an application for return to Australia. I have informed the Corps Commander accordingly.

Ralston interviewed Lt. Lilly of 2nd Div. Machine Gun Battn. who has been adversely reported on by the Col. Promised Lilly to get him transferred to another Division, the 3rd if possible. Inspected Transport of Div. Signal Company. Generally far below the standard I expect. Also inspected Transport lines of mobile echelon of 5th Brigade. In this case conditions were much better. Conference at Corps HQrs. during afternoon re proposed operations in vicinity of Monument Wood. Present Army & Corps Commanders, MGGS & MGRA Army, RAF Brigades and Tank Brigade Commanders also Col.

Blacklow re giving Lilly a chance with 3rd Machine Gun Battalion and made satisfactory arrangements. Forwarded V.C. recommendation for Corporal Brown.\n\nFriday 12th July\n\nStayed in all day and dealt with office papers. The 7th Brigade and 5th Brigade seem now to be hard up against the Boche and further \"peaceful\" advance seems impossible. We are therefore now consolidating on our final line, and any further advance will be properly supported by Artillery etc.\n\nFrench made a good advance just south of us on about a 6000 yd. front. Captured Castel and high ground West of MOREUIL together with over 500 prisoners. Had a game of tennis during the evening between 6 and 8 PM. Gen. Blamey called re proposed future operations.

Major Borwick left for course at Camiers.\n\nWith Capt. Boddam inspected Transport of Machine Gun Battalion during morning. Condition of horses and vehicles good – harness very fair. In afternoon inspected all three Field Companies. Fair only tho’ it is evident they are commencing a new system to a new standard. New rail head established at La Motte in lieu of Poulanville. This will economise motor Transport and save a big mileage.\n\nFrench having a gay day. Our fellows assisting them by playing them soccer and incidentally beating them. About 16 of Gen. Paton’s officers dined with the officers of one of the Zouan regiments. Gen. Paton himself much better.\n\nMonday 15th July\n\nAt 6.30 AM with Capt. McCall visited Brigade HQrs. Discussed with both Brigadiers our final objectives. With Gen. Wisdom went round the whole of his line including his recently captured trenches and Monument Wood. This recent advance has robbed the Boche of splendid observation and we now have the advantage over him. Left Brigade sector very quiet.\n\nCorps Commander called during afternoon and with him I discussed the line for our final objective giving my reasons, and also suggestions for our helping the French on my right in order to improve and shorten our line. He approved my suggestions, conferred with the Army Commander at 5 PM and later phoned me full approval of my suggestions. I am to place myself in direct touch with the Divisional and Corps Commanders of the French troops beside me, and mutually arrange our programme.\n\nFresh Boche offensive opened East and West of Rheims but so far has been well held. I am informed by the French that their secret service had obtained full information concerning the enemy’s complete plans of attack and in consequence the allies were quite ready for this new threat.\n\nInstructions forwarded to Brigades giving definite final objectives.\n\nTuesday 16th July\n\nOur line advanced considerably during night, though unfortunately one party had a bad time in a combat, having an officer and 8 other ranks \nkilled and 9\n wounded two of which \nlatter\n it is feared were not brought back to our lines.\n\nDuring morning called on Divisional & Corps Commanders of French troops on my right and very successfully completed arrangements for our help to them in advancing their line to conform with ours. I anticipate in a few days to have a nicely straightened line – and the French will have ditto.\n\nVery heavy thunderstorm early this morning and the day is exceedingly muggy and trying. Informed Corps Commander of arrangements I had made with the French Division on my Right. General Robertson arrived.\n\nWednesday 17th July\n\nLine on 5th Brigade front again slightly advanced during last night and prisoners & m.guns captured. Heavy enemy gas shelling of our forward Divisional area resulting in approximately 50 gas casualties.\n\nDuring morning inspected Transport of all three Field Ambulances. That of 6th was excellent in every way, 5th fair and \n5\n 4th very poor. ADMS accompanied me. Major Dunlop of 9th Brigade who is ordered to Egypt called to say goodbye to me.\n\nWritten up to Sept 20 by Capt P. O’Hara Wood ADC to Gen Rosenthal, then to Oct 7 by Lieut Pope ADC. Then again by Gen R. \n\nGen R. had been shot in the right forearm. WHI","1084":"\n\nGeneral Paton took General Robertson round all units of 6th Brigade, introduced C.O.’s & officers to the new Brigadier, and generally gave Gen. Robertson current details concerning 6th Brigade. Both Brigadiers dined with us at night at Divl. Headquarters, & this opportunity was taken to officially say good-bye to Gen. Paton and welcome Gen. Robertson. Gen. Paton very much improved in health during the last few days.\n\nThursday 18th July\n\nGen. Paton left for England 9.30 a.m. calling at Corps Headquarters en route. Gen. Robertson with his staff spent the morning around 7th Brigade Front, which 6th Brigade takes over tonight. During the afternoon, the Corps Commander brought to Divl. Headquarters the members of the French Mission, who are about to visit Australia. Their Chairman M. Metin, speaks English fairly well, & asked for letters of introduction to my family, which I gave him. Another very picturesque member of the Mission is Genl. Pau, who served as a General in the 1870 Campaign, and at that time lost his right arm. Army Commander called at 4 p.m, & discussed our Divisional Front generally. He expressed himself as very gratified with the further exploits of the Division since","1085":"\n","1086":"\n\nGen. Robertson & his Brigade Major breakfasted with me at 6.30 a.m., and at 7a.m. we went forward together to the right Brigade sector. We reconnoitred Monument Wood and our new trenches in the locality, then moved along behind our new line of posts to the western end of Railway Mound East of Villers Bretonneux. We had been warned that sniping was severe at the Eastern end of this Mound, so we proceeded\n\nno further than the Western end. From this vantage point, we spent some ten minutes in thoroughly examining enemy territory. Just as we were about to leave, a Boche sniper succeeded in locating me, firing only one shot, with the result, however, that my right thumb was shattered, & the bullet deflected into the flesh part of the fore-arm, severely lacerating nerves, flesh, & artery, and making its exit on the outer side of the fore-arm. Luckily with the exception of the bones of the thumb, no others were damaged. Owing to a considerable loss of arterial blood, I felt rather groggy, and then decided to rest where I was for a little time. However the Boche artillery at this time commenced to land 5.9\"s uncomfortably near us. We therefore decided to take our rest later on, & walked across to the R.A.P. of the right Battalion, where the Medical Officer properly dressed the wound. I then took car back to Divl. Headquarters, spoke to the Corps Commander on the telephone, & arranged for Gen. Wisdom to carry on during my absence. I gathered a few things together, had a light lunch, and with the A.D.M.S. & Capt. Boddam came to the Main Dressing Station at Amiens, where Col. Sir Vincent Welch re-dressed the wounds, and sent me on to No. 5 C.C.S. at Coury. Fearing that I might be evacuated to England, I arranged with D.D.M.S.","1087":" Army that I should be transferred to No. 3 A.G.H, Abbeville, but on arrival at this latter Hospital, I discovered that they had no Officers’ Ward, and accordingly did not accept officers as patients. I then got into touch with the D.D.M.S., L. of C., and obtained permission to remain here. At 5 p.m. Col. Taylor-Young & Major Matthews put me on the operating table, and spent two hours in thoroughly patching me up. I came out of the anaesthetic at 8 & had a fairly good night ’s sleep.\n","1088":" to","1089":"\n\nBetween the above dates I have remained under treatment at No. 3 A.G.H. On the","1090":" July, the surgeons operated for the second time and finding the wounds progressing favourably they were finally sutured. Thereafter my arm has been dressed every second day, and it has been gratifying to see the progress made, especially the damaged thumb. On the morning of","1091":" the surgeons removed 8 stitches and on the","1092":" others were removed, leaving only 4 remaining, which it is proposed to remove on 2nd inst. The surgeons have given me two X-ray prints, one before & one after the operations. They show the surgical work has been well done. During this period, my A.D.C. has visited me daily, bringing private & official correspondence, and keeping me posted in Divisional matters. Gen. Wisdom is commanding the Division in my absence. On 29th inst., Surgeon-General Howse visited this Hospital, & very emphatically declared that it was my duty to go at once to England to ensure receiving the best electrical & massage treatment. In deference to his wishes, I leave here on","1093":" for London to consult three leading specialists, and specially at the Corps Commander’s request & in full accord with my own feelings, I am returning to the Divn., on 5th inst., being promised at a later date any special leave I may require for perhaps getting massage treatment. During my stay here, I have been visited by the Army & Corps Commanders, G.O.C. R.A., and many other friends. I have been exceedingly comfortable & thoroughly well looked after. During the above period, the Boche offensive in the South has not only been held up but chiefly owing to a brilliant counter-thrust on the line Soissons-\n\nChateau-Thierray, not only has the Boche been forced to give up his gains, but he is now himself in \"Queer Street\". Our own Australian troops have been meanwhile harassing him on our Corps Front: the First Division doing ditto at Merriss & Meteren, and further early operations may be looked for.\n\nFriday 2nd Aug.\n\nWith Capt. Boddam left Abbeville in early morning for London arriving Victoria Station 2.30 p.m. Here met Genl. Birdwood, Genl. Griffiths and Col. Anderson adms. The latter made arrangements for me to visit Wandsworth Hospital tomorrow morning and have my arm dressed.\n\nGeneral Griffiths kindly provided us with a car and we went straight to White Hall Hotel, Guildford St. Felt very tired and went to bed at 8.30.\n","1094":"\n\nStayed in in the morning while Capt. Boddam carried out sundry commissions and attended opening ceremony of Australia House by His Majesty the King. Most excellent show and I saw many old friends there. Guard of honour was particularly good. After lunch when out to Wandsworth and had arm dressed getting on quite well. Again went to bed early.\n","1095":"\n\nImmediately after breakfast went to Wandsworth Hospital and had arm dressed again. A Specialist surgeon Capt. Raymond Johnston, after examining my arm told me there was no reason why I should not go back to France immediately provided facilities existed for frequent dressing.\n\nHe stated it would probably be a month before any electrical or massage treatment could be complied. Saw Col. Moseley at Wandsworth, he is getting on well and is very cheery. Had intended to attend service at St. Pauls but was detained too long at Wandsworth. Attended open air service in the afternoon in Hyde Park, service being conducted by the Bishop of London. Met General Ryan in Rotten Row and he kindly promised me a set of his Gallipoli photographs and also arranged to take my photo in colours at Horseferry Rd. tomorrow morning.\n","1096":"\n\nCalled on General Ryan at Horseferry Rd. in the morning also saw Colonel Maudsley. Col. Ryan took photo as promised drew pay at Pay Office called on Genl. Griffiths also saw Genl. Birdwood who was with him. Genl. Howse then took me to see Lt. Col. Sir Hugh Rigby another specialist and after examining my arm endorsed the opinion of the Wandsworth surgeon of yesterday. He anticipates it may take six months before I regain full use of hand and fingers. During the afternoon again went to Wandsworth and had arm dressed and on the return journey called at Queens Club to see O’Hara Wood play but unfortunately he had just finished.\n\nTuesday 6th Aug.\n\nLeft Charing Cross for Folkestone at 11.40 and arrived at Boulogne about 5. Gave Col. Stephenson a lift back with us in the car called at No. 3 AGH and had arm dressed reached Glisy about 9p.m. Took over command from Genl. Wisdon he returning to his Brigade. All arrangements complete for attack on the morning of the 8th inst. \n\ninvolving the Canadian Corps on the South, Australian Corps in the Centre and Third Corps on the North. On our Corps front the attack is to be carried by the 2nd and 3rd Divisions, the 5th and 4th going through them to continue. The 7th Bde. on the right and the 5th on the left are attacking on this Divisional front.\n\nWednesday 7th Aug:\n\nVisited all Brigadiers during the morning and found all arrangements well in hand and in afternoon went through files of operation orders with Col. Miles as well as Q. arrangements for ammunitions and supplies generally. Visited Headquarters 5th Aust. Divn. & met Genl. Burstall G.O.C. 2nd Canadian Divn. and later visited 6th Brigade. General Birdwood visited Divisional Headquarters and wished us \nT\n well on next days operations later visiting all Brigadiers.\n\nThursday 8th Aug:\n\nAttack commenced at 4.20 this morning. Both Brigadiers gained their objectives to time table our own casualties very light prisoners captured about 1600 and a large number of field guns, machine guns and trench mortars besides large quantities of military stores. The 5th Division advanced to their final objectives through us and were equally successful in fact all Corps employed had a very successful day and the French who attacked on the South equally so.\n\nDuring the day all Brigades were reorganised and Divisional Headquarters \nmove\n arranged to move to Villers Bretonneux tomorrow morning. I am keeping complete files of the operation which speak for themselves.\n\nFriday 9th Aug:\n\nDivisional Headquarters moved to Villers Bretonneux, the attack continued throughout the day the first Division on the right, 2nd in centre and third on left again pushing forward capturing more prisoners, guns etc. The 3rd Corps on the North have had difficulty and could not maintain themselves on their final objective. They had to retire some distance and American troops are being sent to their assistance. Canadians and French on the South have made good progress. I should have mentioned on the 8th that Armoured Cars, Tanks and Cavalry splendidly cooperated with the infantry.\n\nSaturday 10th Aug:\n\nStill further advances today the 5th & 7th Brigades moving forward under very effective barrage. Tanks also assisting. The 3rd Division on the North in attempting to push forward met with heavy casualties from artillery and aeroplane bombs and were accordingly held up. Their left Brigade however after stiff fighting made a very useful advance and captured some hundreds of prisoners. During the morning with GSO I called on Brigadiers and also Tank Brigade commander at Warfusee. Enemy vigorously bombing at night.\n\nSunday 11th Aug:\n\nFront line now more or less Stationary and Boche resistance hardening. At 2.30 p.m. at First Aust. Divn.

Artillery also came into the line to cover us. I should have mentioned that on the 11th inst. Genl. Wisdom was asked for to assume command of a mixed force of Australians and Americans, known as the Liason Force, to operate North of the Somme. The King this morning visited the high ground East of Corbie and later came through Villers Bretonneux. Divisional Commanders were invited to meet His Majesty at Corps Headquarters at 2.30 p.m. and were duly presented. The Corps Commander and S. Major Genl. O’Keefe\n\nDMS of 4th Army were knighted the former as K.C.B. and the latter as K.C.M.G.\n\nAfter the King’s departure a conference of Divisional Commanders was held and details for proposed operation on the 15th inst. were decided.

Corps Commander informed us of new divisional boundaries divisions from South to North being as follows 32nd, 5th, 2nd, 3rd Aust. He also\n\noutlined future policy which was to the effect that the Corps objective is to be the line of the Somme from Peronne southwards divisions will be expected to remain in the line for some little time and will employ only one Brigade for the whole divisional front leap frogging remaining Brigades through as the advance continues. Went on from Corps to Daors where I met brigadiers and staffs and informed them of future role. 6th Bde. is to move forward tonight and take over line tomorrow night from 1st Aust. Divn. In afternoon went to Abbeville had arm dressed. Major Matthews will not allow splint to be removed during day. Saw Genl. Burgess and his staff at hospital.

Command of divisional sector passed from G.O.C. 1st to 2nd at 10 p.m.\n\nTuesday 27th Aug.\n\nAt 10a.m. with Major Borwick went forward to Brigade H Qrs. and discussed situation generally with Genl. Robertson.\n\nWith him and Genl. Martin walked forward on to the high ground West of Cappy from which point a good view is obtained East and North East. Line advanced considerably on the left front during the night and still further advanced today a few prisoners captured. Genl. Budworth MGRA 4th Army called.\n\nWednesday 28th Aug.\n\nDuring the day","1097":" Brigade continued its advance being for a time held up on the extreme left by enemy located in Frise and the trench system immediately East of this village. Eventually the village was mopped up resulting in the capture of 50 Boche 10 Machine Guns, 1 Trench Mortar and 1 Anti Land Field Gun. Fontaine les Cappy and Dompierre also Becquincourt were captured and at 8 pm a line was established midway between Dompierre and Herbecourt. At this hour the 5th Brigade passed through the 6th immediately South of the Somme Canal on a 2000 yard front. The 6th Brigade was ordered to push forward during the night to the Herbecourt trench system. Conference was held at our Divisional Head Quarters of all Divisional Commanders with Corps Commander. General Montgomery also present.\n\nThursday 28th Aug.\n\nActing on last night’s instructions the 6th Brigade during the night advanced and captured Herbecourt and the trench systems running North and South. In addition they advanced their line another 2000 yards, which advance included the capture of Hancourt. At 7.30a.m. the 7th Brigade moved through the 6th and reached the Somme by the afternoon. The advance was held up several times by machine gun fire and in the capture \n\nof Biaches and La Chapelette sharp fighting took place resulting in the capture of prisoners of 2nd Guards Division together with a number of machine guns. Meantime the 5th Brigade on its front had also advanced to the Somme opposite Halle. A conference of Divisional Commanders with the Corps Commander was held during the afternoon at 5th Divisional Head quarters and as a result of Army policy, deflecting the advance of Australian Corps from an Easterly to a North-Easterly direction, Divisional boundaries were somewhat altered, a larger frontage being allotted to the 32nd Division on the right, which is to adopt a more or less passive role, while the 5th, 2nd and 3rd Aust. Divisions, which are to carry on the advance, are given reduced frontages. To-night it is hoped to secure crossings across the Somme and if successful, adjustments of Divisional boundaries will made tomorrow. The allied forces North and South of us have made substantial advances. O’Hara Wood returned from London.\n\nFriday 30th Aug.\n\nBoth Brigadiers found it impossible to provide crossings over the Somme during last night, marshy ground being the chief hindrance. The 7th Brigade has tried all day to get across South of Peronne, but without success. The 5th Brigade was brought back a short distance and made a crossing of the Somme at Feuilleres and joined forces with the flank of 3rd Aust. Division who early in the day captured Clery. By 11.30 p.m. the 5th Brigade had established a line some thousand yards East of Clery and of about 2000 yards frontage. It was evident that Clery had not been mopped up by the 10th Brigade, for our advance in the evening was seriously hampered by enemy machine gun fire. The","1098":" Brigade remains in reserve at Feuilleres while the","1099":" Brigade is deployed along the western bank of the Somme South of Peronne.\n\nThe Army and Corps Commanders called during the afternoon and discussed proposals for the capture of Mont St. Quentin; the Army Commander being specially interested because of having operated in this area with","1100":" Army during first battle of the Somme.\n","1101":"\n\nAt 5a.m. this morning the","1102":" Brigade launched its attack against Mont St. Quentin. Adequate artillery support was available, but a formal barrage was not laid down. Instead a system of area shoots was arranged to assist the advancing Infantry. Mont St. Quentin was reached at an early hour and the village of Feuillaucourt was taken. The total casualties in the attack up to this time was 80, while about 1000 prisoners was taken. Later in the day Mont St. Quentin and Feuillaucourt were heavily shelled, forcing our withdrawal to the western edge of those villages. Meanwhile the 14th Brigade of 5th Aust. Div. who were to capture the high ground South East of Peronne, passed through our territory, it having been found impossible to establish bridges across the Somme in their own area. The 6th Brigade had already crossed and formed up in the vicinity of Halle as support Brigade. The 14th Brigade was unable to force its way round the North and North East of Peronne. Tonight found us with the 5th Brigade holding a line Feuillaucourt-Mont St. Quentin-Anvil Wood with the 6th Brigade in trench system immediately East of Halle, with 14th Brigade in rear. The exploit of the 5th Brigade was worthy of the highest praise. During last night a crossing was completed at the Canal du Nord, both tasks being carried out under a good deal of 5.9 shell fire. At night a conference was held at 6th Brigade Head Quarters and all details arranged between Staff, Gunners,\n\nand Infantry for a further advance tomorrow to be carried out by the 6th Brigade.\n\nSunday 1st September\n\nAt 6 am the 6th Brigade launched its attack, the objective being the trench system about 1500 yards East of Mont St. Quentin. Again very heavy fighting was experienced, but at nightfall, though we had not gained our selected objective, we had established a strong line in a trench system East of Mont St. Quentin and running almost to the Western outskirts of Allaines. On our right flank the 14th Brigade made preparations for an attack tomorrow morning. The Army Commander and M.G.G.S. called just after lunch and tendered their congratulations on the Division’s success. A wire was also received from General Birdwood in similar terms. During the afternoon I visited a German heavy gun near Chinques. A very interesting piece of ordnance which has been badly destroyed, apparently by explosives. At Corps Commander’s request, visited Corps Head Quarters at Mericourt to discuss with him our operations for tomorrow morning, designed to form a defensive flank on ridge running North East from Mont St. Quentin for the flank Division of the 3rd Corps. On my return to the Division discussed details with General Wisdom who is to carry out the task and C.R.A. operation to commence at 6a.m. The 5th Division have arranged to attack East of Anvil Wood at 6a.m. My right flank moving up in sympathy with their advance.\n\nMonday 2nd September\n\nThe 7th Brigade attacked this morning under artillery support, captured Haut Allaines and maintained touch for a time with the 74th Division. The Boche however in counter-attack drove back the 74th Division, thus compelling us to refuse a flank to our left about 1000 yards\n\nEast of Haut Allaines. On the Right flank the 5th Division has had heavy fighting, but is now established East of St. Denis, with our troops linking up with them. Again there has been heavy fighting today and many enemy killed, while our prisoners since the 31st total about 1300. The 6th Brigade remains in its battle position of last night, while the 5th Brigade is concentrated and resting at Halle. General Budworth called this afternoon. Late this evening General Wisdom reported about a battalion of the 74th Division was located in his area. He has arranged to use them in the consolidation of his line tonight, with the approval of their Divisional Commander and they will rejoin their own unit tomorrow morning.\n\nTuesday 3rd September\n\nIn morning attended conference of Brigadiers at Head Quarters 6th Brigade. It is evident that the men are very tired and require a good rest. At the conclusion of conference, received word from Divisional Head Quarters that certain alterations were pending affecting Divisional boundaries, which will work out to our advantage. Called on Corps Commander at noon and he then told me definitely that the 74th Division is to extend Southward and the 5th Aust. Division to extend Northward, thus pinching out the 2nd Aust. Div. Our relief is to take place on the night of the 4th. During afternoon entertained to afternoon tea visiting newspaper proprietors and journalists from Australia. The Corps Commander accompanied them and had already described to them in detail on the ground the opening and succeeding phases of the battle of August 8th. On my maps I showed the visitors the progressive advances to, and the capture of, Mount St. Quentin.\n\nWednesday 4th September\n\nThe 5th Division still continued to have heavy fighting at Flamicourt. Our own troops have maintained touch with the 5th Division at St. Denis and with the 74th Division North East of Haut Allaines. Reliefs carried out during the night, the 231st Brigade of 74th Division relieving the Northern sector of our front and the 8th Brigade of 5th Aust. Division relieving our Southern sector. Before handing over, however, General Wisdom pushed out his North and South flanks very appreciably in conjunction with flank Brigades. Command of their respective new sectors passed to the G.O.C’s. 5th Aust. and 74th Divisions at midnight. Early in the afternoon the 5th Brigade moved to billeting area in the vicinity of Frise, the 6th Brigade following later to their area near Cappy, while the 7th Brigade after relief, moved to the western bank of the Somme opposite Halle & bivouaced. Divisional Artillery also came out of the line and moved to the vicinity of Bray.\n","1103":"\n\nThe 7th Brigade moved to its billeting area, near Eclusier. The whole Division is now in rest. The three Brigadiers dined with us at Divisional Head Quarters and Colonel Miles and Colonel Corlette returned from leave. Corps made a request for a working party of 500 Pioneers to assist in urgent Railway operations in connection with opening the permanent way to Peronne.\n\nFriday 6th September\n\nIn morning Colonel Miles and O’Hara Wood and myself motored through Herbecourt, Omiecourt, Clery, and Feuillaucourt to Mount St. Quentin. We roamed over the Mount and along the spine running North Easterly, that was captured by the 7th Brigade on the 2nd instant. Looking from\n\nthe Mount westward a good view is obtained of the trench system and wiring, constituting the defences of this prominent feature. One appreciates to the full the difficult nature of the task and the gallant work done by our infantry on the 31st August and 1st September. We returned to Divisional Head Quarters through Anvil Wood, Halle, and Biaches. The enemy is now rapidly falling back to the Hindenberg Line and our troops are, to-night, some 12,000 yards East of Peronne. The Corps has three Divisions in the line; the 32nd on the Right, 5th Aust. in Centre, and 3rd Aust. on left. The 1st and 4th Divisions are being bussed up by groups and are following on the 5th and 3rd Divisions to the objective of the Hindenberg Line. I received a cable from my father to-day saying that the mater died on the evening of Wednesday the 4th.\n\nSaturday 7th September\n\nIn the morning in company with C.R.E., Capt. Boddam and O.C. French Mission, visited Mont St. Quentin and selected a suitable sight for a memorial in connection with the capture of this Mount by the 2nd Aust. Div. O.C. French Mission promised to see Peronne authorities and have the selected area dedicated to the Division. After wards went through St. Denis to Aizecourt, thence to Bussu, to high ground close to Lincourt, back to Doingt, thence through Peronne, which is very badly damaged, and back to Divisional Head Quarters via Biaches and Herbecourt. Saw General Cannan at his Head Quarters in Bois de Flacques on the way to Lincourt. Very fine open country and in good order, though the Boche seems to have burnt all the villages. Colonel Miles and Major Borwick visited the Mont St. Quentin battle-ground with the Brigade Majors of 5th &","1104":" Brigades in order to ensure complete and accurate details for the report of the battle, which is being prepared\n","1105":"\n\nReceived word today that owing to inability of General MacLagan to attend Allied Tank School at Fontainebleau, it has been arranged by Corps that I am to take his place. Discussion with Corps re the proposal to transfer Captain Grant to this Signal Company and Captain Linkler to Corps Signal Company, when Major Watson goes to Australia on furLough. Informed Corps I could not agree to both C.O. and","1106":" in Command being taken from the Div. Signal Company at this juncture. Arranged with General Robertson to assume command of the Division during my absence at Tank School.\n","1107":"\n\nIn early morning left for Fontainebleau in company with Colonel Miles and Captain O’Hara Wood to attend Allied Tank School. On the way down we traversed the old French Somme battlefields at Fay Estrees and Ablainecourt to Chaulnes. Thence via Roye and Lassigny to Noyon. This latter town is very much damaged, the fine old Cathedral particularly so. From Noyon we attempted to journey to Soissons but found the bridges over the Oise had been destroyed and new ones not emplaced, so deflected our course to Compiegne which also has been much damaged by bombing. Thence via Senlis to Paris. Called at Military Hospital Val de Grasse, and made an appointment to see a nerve specialist Doctor Kouindjy for 10 am on 14th inst. Lunched at Cafe de Parisin Avenue de L’Opera, and later in the afternoon continued the journey to Fontainebleau, reporting to the Lower Major at 4.30 p.m. Captain O’Hara Wood made necessary Hotel arrangements, billeting us at Hotel de France et d’Angleterre, while our meals were arranged for at Hotel Francois Ier. The School programme\n\nprovides that we leave Fontainebleau each morning at 8 AM for Recloses, a village some 8 kilometres from the town. Mornings are to be spent at practical demonstrations of French and English Tanks, while the afternoons are to be devoted to lectures.\n","1108":"\n\nVery heavy rain set in during the morning and quite spoilt the work of the day. General Estienne the French Tank Corps Commander opened the proceedings by a short address in which he welcomed the assembled officers and then briefly explained the organization and tactics of Tanks. Later in the morning we were shown the new French Renault Tank together with British Mark V and Mark V star Tanks. Very heavy rain however forced a discontinuance of the day’s work at Recloses but after lunch the C.O. of the British Tanks came to Fontainebleau and gave the afternoon’s lecture there. The weather cleared about 4 pm. so we took the opportunity of motoring round and through the Fontainebleau Forest – the many excellent drives giving us an ample opportunity of seeing a great deal of this famous wood.\n","1109":"\n\nThis morning’s programme provided for illustrations in attack of both French and British Tanks, while in the afternoon the lecture was on the organization of the French Tank Corps. After our return to Fontainebleau, we went through the famous old Palace, which was full of interest. One wished one could have seen it in all its splendour of Napoleon’s days. Purchased some booklets of views to send home.\n","1110":"\n\nIn the morning a scheme was given effect to illustrating cooperation of French and British Tanks including Whippets. Opportunities were given members of the course to take a ride in Whippet Tanks. The afternoon lecture referred to lessons from recent Tank operations and also gave an outline of the operations for to-morrow. In the afternoon we motored to Chateau Thierry via \nNangis\n Mormant, Rozoy, Coulommiers and La Ferte, returning via Rebais, Saint Just, and Nangis. The Marne River both at La Ferte and Chateau Thierry is a very fine stream and the hilly country very beautiful. Chateau Thierry itself, which I had expected to find in ruins, has really not been badly damaged, probably 75% of the buildings being intact. It was interesting to note that the population had returned and the shops apparently doing good business. On the journey from Nangis southward, we saw numerous coveys of Partridge and after dark while passing through wooded country, dozens of rabbits dodged across the road in front of the car.\n","1111":"\n\nThe morning was devoted to an interesting scheme, providing for the assistance of French Tanks actually with the Infantry in attack being preceded by British Mark V Tanks, while British Whippets were employed in exploitation into enemy country. In this and previous schemes, American and Italian troops were employed. The afternoon was spent in visiting the French Workshops at Bourron. Here we saw Renault, Chamond and Schneider tanks being repaired and overhauled, the two latter types being now, however, obsolete. The method of loading and unloading the Renault Tank\n\non motor lorries was practically illustrated and later the German Tank \"Elfriede\" was inspected and its construction explained. The course concluded about 2.30 p.m. Among those present were French and \nPortuguese\n Italian Generals and officers of other Ranks, also Belgian, American and British Officers, among the latter being General Vaughan a Brigadier of the Ulster Division. In the afternoon returned to Parisvia Chapelle la Reine, Milly, La Ferte-Alais, and Arpajon then by main Orleans Road. Stayed the night at the Hotel Edouard VII.\n","1112":"\n\nAt 10a.m. visited Val de Grasse Hospital, where Doctor Kouindjy examined my arm and had electrical tests applied. He informed me that the arm was progressing quite satisfactorily and that I should regain full use of it, at the same time ordering me to cease wearing the splint. He promised to send me later by post the results of his tests and suggestions for future treatment. Lunched at Cafe de Parisand left Parisat 2.30 p.m. for Cappy, via Luzarches, Creil, Clermont, Saint Just en Chaussee, Montdidier and Rosieres, reaching D.H.Q. at about 7.30 p.m.\n\nSunday 15th September\n\nStayed in during the morning writing letters and in the afternoon visited sports ground. During our absence Brigades have carried out their Brigade sports and Divisional sports are arranged for the whole day 16th inst.\n\nMonday 16th September\n\nWent to the Sports Grounds at 10a.m. and remained there throughout the day, luncheon being provided on the ground. We were fortunate in having beautiful weather and both competitors and\n\nonlookers appeared to thoroughly enjoy themselves. Divisional War Bonds sweeps were inaugurated, each sweep being for 1000 francs and during the day no less than four were drawn, while the fifth was almost fully subscribed. Among several other visitors General Birdwood and General Monash attended, also Matron and Nurses from No. 41 and No. 5 C.C.S’s. The Matron, late in the afternoon, presenting the prizes to the prize winners. The Sports Committee with General Robertson as President are certainly to be congratulated on their efforts in organizing such a fine show. The official Photographer took a number of photos. A party of 1914 personnel from this Division, in all 16 officers and other Ranks left for 6 months furLough to Australia including Captain Boddam, the Camp Commandant and Major Watson, O.C. Signals. As the former is to be married, while in Australia, the officers of Divisional Head Quarters subscribed and handed him 300 francs, for the purchase of a wedding present, as a reminder of his pleasant associations with the officers of D.H.Q. Lieut. Pope is being appointed Personal A.D.C. and Captain O’Hara Wood assumes the responsibilities of Camp Commandant.\n\nTuesday 17th September\n\nParticularly heavy thunderstorm at 2 a.m. During morning with Colonel Miles and Major Borwick went through final draft of report concerning operations of the Division up to and including the capture of Mont Saint Quentin, embodying certain corrections agreed upon between G.O.C’s. 5th and 6th Brigades concerning certain aspects of their operations. In afternoon visited Hospital at Abbeville and told Major Matthews and Colonel Taylor-Young of the Parisspecialist’s report on my arm. Hence\n\non to G.H.Q. at Montreuil, where I made arrangements for permission for Charles to visit me here during his forthcoming leave. Went on to Campagne and stayed the night there, while Pope went on to Boulogne.\n\nWednesday 18th September\n\nLieutenant Pope returning from Boulogne picked me up at Campagne at 11 AM. W e returned to Cappy via Theronanne, Arras, Bapaume and Albert. Fourth and First Divisions this morning carried out a very successful attack towards the Hindenberg Line. All objectives gained and over 3000 prisoners. In the evening attended concert run by Divisional Concert Party, which has been recently organised. Quite a good show and very well put on. Appointment of Major McCall as Brigade Major 6th Brigade and Captain Bazeley as G.S.O. III at Division have been approved by G.H.Q. and were yesterday notified to Division.\n\nThursday 19th September\n\nInterviewed General Robertson, Colonel Duggan and Lieut. Smitheram regarding the latter’s inefficiency. Decided to recommend his return to Australia. General Foote called re proposed organisation Corps Engineer Motor Transport. In afternoon interviewed Lieut. Dunkerton in the presence of his Battalion Commander and General Wisdom. This officer has been superseded many times during the last 2 years and now asks to be returned to Australia. As he is not fitted for command I am forwarding and recommending his application. At 5 p.m. attended a conference at Corps Head Quarters. Present Corps Commander and Staff and G.O.C’ s. 2nd, 3rd and 5th Divisions\n\nwith their G.S.O’s I. Corps Commander foreshadowed possible forthcoming operations, with an idea of their nature. Details later. It has now been decided to at once re-organise Brigades on a 3 Battalion basis. The 7th Brigade will lose 25th Battalion, the","1113":" the","1114":" and the 5th either the","1115":" or","1116":" Final decisions in the latter case awaiting wire from General Martin who is in England.

Train, O.C. Machine Gun Battalion, A.D.M.S, G.S.O. 1., AA & QMG and C.R.E. and O.C. Signals. Outlined proposals for future operations of the Division. Training during the next few days to be specially directed to fitting the troops for open warfare involving possibly a considerable advance. Mr. Box, Commonwealth High Commissioner’s Secretary in London together with several journalists arrived and lunched with us. The operations of the Division from the 25th August onward were described to them with the aid of a map and later Captain Bazeley conducted them via the Omiecourt crossing of the Somme to Mont Saint Quentin, thence via Perronne and Herbecourt to Chinques, where the party inspected the destroyed Boche 15\" gun. Arranged with Corps Commander for visit to Base at Havre and Australian Sections 3rd Echelon at Rouen leaving here tomorrow and returning 24th inst. Report on Divisional operations between 26th August and 4th September completed and will be issued to-morrow. Bishop Long called re appointment of Divisional Education Officer.\n\nSaturday 21st September\n\nIn the morning with Lieut. Pope left for Havre & Roeun travelling via Abbeville (where I saw Major Matthews & gave him the Parisian specialist’s report on my arm), Neufchatel, Longueville, Doudeville, & Goderville to Australian General Base Depot at Harfleur. Called on Major Bates at the R.F.A. & R.H.A. Depot & dined with him, afterwards going to the A.G.B.D., where I found Col. Davis the Commandant ill in bed. Stayed the night at his Headquarters.\n\nSunday 22nd September\n\nA very wet day. In the morning discussed reinforcements matters generally with Col. Davis afterwards visiting Col. O’Donnel of the Infantry Base Depot & Col. Burston of the Convalescent Depot. Made arrangements that men of good character within the Division who are so war worn as to be unable to stand up against present enemy artillery fire should be given an opportunity to have up to four months stay at the Base Depots & be there employed. After lunch motored to Roeun via the direct road on the northern banks of the Somme, an exceedingly pretty trip, though the rain rather prevented our seeing the country to full advantage. Called on Col. Griffiths at Headquarters of Australian Section 3rd Echelon G.H.Q. & with him discussed details concerning base records. Stayed at Grand Hotel de la Poste, Rue Jeanne d’Arc, a very comfortable Hotel indeed though expensive.\n\nMonday 23rd September\n\nDuring morning went through Base Record matters with Col. Griffiths. Before lunch\n\nvisited No. 1 A.G.H at the Racecourse immediately south of Roeun. Col. Dick the C.O. showed me round. There I met Col. Springthorpe who is over from England on special duty & as he was very anxious to visit General Monash I gave him a seat in my car. Left Roeun at 4 p.m. & returned to Cappy via Gournay, Crevecoeur & Amiens, arriving at D.H.Q. at 8.30 p.m. During my absence it had been decided that under the new scheme for re-organisation of Brigades, the 19th Battalion of 5th Bgde. should be the one disbanded.\n\nTuesday 24th September\n\n10 a.m. called on Corps Commander taking with me Col. Springthorpe who later in the morning went forward with General Monash, lunched with him & caught the 6 o’clock train at Amiens for Paris. A party of Journalists from England arrived at 11.30 a.m. & Capt. Beasley was detailed to show them round the Mont St. Quentin battlefield. In connection with the re-organisation of Brigades General Robertson informed me that he anticipated trouble with the 21st Battalion, he asked me to speak to the officers & N.C.O’s. setting out the circumstances which necessitated this re-organisation. Later in the afternoon I spoke to the whole Battalion. During the morning the 37th Battalion of 10th Bgde. which was to be disbanded refused to march to their new units & the Corps Commander himself spoke to their officers & N.C.O’s. but without result. There appears to be an organised effort to defeat the orders given & to save the Battalion concerned.\n\nWednesday 25th September\n\nGeneral Robertson reported to me that the 21st Battalion refuses to march over to its new units. Attended a conference at Corps\n\nHeadquarters at which the G.O.C. A.I.F. was present, also Divisional Commanders of 3rd & 5th Divisions.

All this time I had been with the Captain on his bridge.\n\n\"Cardiff\" signalled to \"Konisberg\" \"Follow me 21 Knots\". All other ships of squadron and Destroyers then took Stations as on previous page and made for the Forth.\n\nThe \"Konisberg\" flew the Admiral’s flag at the foremast, a large white flag at the main mast, and the German ensign at the gaff.\n\nShe is a small looking craft, armed with 5.9.\n\nOur guns were manned on sighting \"Konisberg\".\n\nOn arriving at the anchorage off Inch Reith \"Cardiff\" signalled \"10 Knots\", \"stop\", \"Anchor\".\n\nA number of civilians were to be seen on board.\n\nC in C wirelessed \"You are requested to refrain from using Radio\", and he also informed Admiral Meurer he did not wish to see Socialist delegates.

Brand (son of Viscount Hampden at one time Governor of N.S.W.)\n\nand the Captain of the Q.E. and conducted below to the C in C The meeting was formal in the extreme strictly courteous but distinctly cold \nand\n. Both bowed stiffly. The German Admiral so keenly felt his position that it was an appreciable time before he could speak but his ashen face clearly showed he felt his task to be a truly bitter one.\n\nHe and his staff were given a meal in Commodore Brands cabin. Some difficulty was occasioned in obtaining the necessary personnel to attend upon these officers. The meal consisted in the main of a leg of mutton, two bottles of Claret one of port, and other sundry articles and it is significant that at the conclusion of the meal nothing remained but empty bottles and the bare mutton bone.\n\nThe civilians who came over in the \"Konisberg\" lived on the mess deck. I got back to \"Melbourne\" about 11 PM.\n\nFrom about 10.30 AM fog commenced to lift and by the time \"Konisberg\" was sighted the day was reasonably clear and a thoroughly good view was obtainable of the german cruiser. At night fog again settled down on the Forth.\n\nSaturday 16th November\n\nDense fog all day hence confined to ship.\n\nSunday 17th November\n\nMy stay in \"Melbourne\" terminated and today I transferred to HMAS \"Australia\" flying the flag of Rear Admiral Halsey, commanding 2nd Battle Cruise Squadron. At night with Admiral Halsey dined with Vice Admiral de Roebeck on HMS \"King George V\". She is lying West of Forth Bridge while \"Australia\" is lying East – distance apart about 3 to 4 miles. Fog very dense, but we succeeded in reaching \"King George\" only about 20 minutes late. A very enjoyable dinner & met many old friends of Gallipoli days. After dinner saw a fine cinema show on board. On boarding the Admirals barge for the return journey the fun commenced. The fog was now denser than ever, but after much trouble we made the Forth Bridge not however the centre bay as intended but the most southerly bay. We knew our position however and the Admiral himself\n\ncontrolled the helm. Judge of our surprise a little later when we thought we were well on our way to our ship on our Easterly course to find ourselves passing under the northern bay of the bridge, having come due north instead of East. The explanation lay in the fact that the steel work of the bridge affected the compass. Finally we reached the \"New Zealand\" the next ship to our own and thought we were now out of trouble. The next ship we located which we concluded as the \"Australia\" proved to be the \"Barham\" our course having been this time south instead of East. Again we tried to make the \"Australia\" but found ourselves back again to the \"New Zealand\". Our next attempt took us at last to the \"Australia\" at 1 AM having been 2 hours doing 3 to 4 miles.\n\nMonday 18th November\n\nSpent an interesting day in looking over the \"Australia\". The former Admiral (Admiral Levison) has made his apartments very interesting. He has collected Australian books, early experiences concerning early explorers, and recorded on the walls the doings of early navigators and the various flagships of the Australian Stations. At night dined with Admiral Levison now a Vice Admiral flying his flag on the \"Barham\". Here I met a retired naval officer Admiral Farquhar who is full of interesting incident and anecdote. We all after dinner visited the \"Warsprite\" and attended a most excellent Comic Opera performance of \"The Time Machine\", based on \"The Merry Wives of Windsor. I thoroughly enjoyed the show.\n\nEarly in the day met Vice Admiral Napier.\n\nTuesday 19th November\n\nNoted H.M.S. \"Courageous\" one of the British Ships\" flying Vice Admiral NaPiers Flag. His Capt. (Capt. Bromley) showed me all over the ship. I was much interested in her. Her triple gun turrets were new to me, and her engine rooms too were full of interest. On this ship met Admiral Oliver.\n\nVisited Admiral Phillimore on the \"Furious\", an aeroplane ship also full of interest and saw many new innovations including aeroplanes carrying torpedoes. At night Admiral Halsey\n\ndined with the C in C and the other British Admirals with Admiral Rodman of U.S. Ship \"New York\". During the day visited the \"New York\" and was much struck with the great interest that is taken in the comfort and welfare of the men. Admiral Farquhar dined with me in the \"Australia\". German Fleet is to surrender on 21st inst. Mr. Murdock (an Australian pressman) and Mr. Preston are being accommodated on \" Australia\" and arrived tonight. Wired to London for an official artist to come aboard.\n\nWednesday 20th November\n\nToday the King and Queen visited the Fleet. The King inspected the Fleet while the Queen visited Hospitals. During the morning I visited the \"Ayres\" a new aeroplane ship then went off to the new \"Vendector\" launched last October and from her deck or rather bridge saw the King move round the Fleet on the Destroyer Oak and added my cheer to those lustily given by Ships Companies. In the Vendector I met Capt. Grace who had served with us at Gallipoli. Admiral Phillimore lunched with us in \"Australia\". Official artist missed his train, but Col. Ironside of Corps HQrs. arrived and will witness tomorrow’s Ceremony. A number of Australian Soldiers (about 12) from all Divisions had persuaded the officer in charge of \"Australia’s\" picket boat at Forth Bridge to allow them to come on board to see some friends. On arrival they requested to be allowed to remain to see the surrender of German Fleet. The Commander promised to lay their request before the Admiral and advise them later. They however had heard I was on board so as a deputation they paraded before me asking me to use my influence with the Admiral. I did so and he at once agreed to let them remain so tomorrow they will be among the few soldiers who will see this great naval event. Fog is still very dense and heavy and present indications are not hopeful for observance of tomorrow’s pageant. Ship has been newly painted and will tomorrow fitly represent \"Australia\", the Sydney and Melbourne too will take part with their own Cruiser Squadron under Admiral Ferguson.\n\nThursday 21st November\n\nThis day is \neasily\n surely the greatest in the Naval History of the World, for the proud and boastful German Fleet has under its own steam and manned by its own officers and men arrived in British Waters and has \nhanded\n surrendered itself \nover\n to the British Navy of glorious and stainless fame. Never was victory so complete and never humiliation so great. It was a proud privilege to watch this wonderful surrender especially as I saw it all from the Bridge of our own HMAS \"Australia\", which as leader of the 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron and flying the Flag of Rear Admiral Halsey was well placed from a spectacular point of view. As a representative of the British and Australian Army together with other officers and men of the Australian Corps, I paid my tribute to the ceaseless watchfulness, bravery and daring of our own British tars and their ships.\n\nAt 3.10 AM \"Australia\" was under weigh. I came up on deck in case anything of interest could be seen. The most gratifying feature was the clearness of the morning. The fog had dispersed and it seemed as if Providence had specially vouchsafed a clear day for this dramatic scene of the supremacy of right over wrong.\n\nGradually ships took up their allotted Stations as shown on opposite page. Little could be seen of the Grand Fleet other than our own Squadron for the lines of ships \n was\n were 6 miles apart. Several evolutions were performed prior to meeting the German Fleet.\n\nEarly in the afternoon the Cardiff was sighted leading the line of German ships and towing her observation balloon. The air service was represented by air ships and many aeroplanes. Unfortunately from the \"Australia\" only a local view could be obtained, the whole convoy covering as it did a depth of 20 miles. The German Flagship \"Frederick der Grosse\" together with \"Konig Albert\", \"Kaiser\" and \"Kron Prinz William\" could be clearly discerned but the remaining German ships were lost in the distance. The whole proud Fleet turned and took up Station as shown on sketch page 487 , escorting the German Fleet to Inch Reith where they were to anchor.\n\nThe 2nd BCS of which \"Australia\" is the Flag ship was detailed together with 1st B.S., 2nd Light C.S., 3rd Light C.S., and destroyers as detailed by Commodore Tweedie as guard over the German Fleet when anchored so during the afternoon our Squadron took up Station in rear.\n\nCruising Order When Approaching Rendezvous With German Ships Proceeding To Rosyth - For Internment.\n\nWhile in process of so doing the whole German Fleet including Destroyers passed us, and the magnitude of the German Naval debacle was brought home to us in a most vivid manner.\n\nThe surrender involved 14 heavy ships, 7 Light Cruisers (names see sketch) and 50 destroyers of latest pattern from 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th & 7th Flotilla.\n\nJust about dusk \"Australia\" came to anchor in her allotted place, the German ships having previously acted similarly.\n\nEach ship in the Grand Fleet for this day flew 2 white ensigns, large new and clean, and in these flags lay the only token of jubilation in what was otherwise a stern and silent proceeding.\n\nThe formation of the German fleet can be seen in adjoining sketch, Battle Cruisers leading Light Cruisers 3 miles astern (all 3 cables apart), Destroyers as 5 groups 6 miles astern of L.C.s all single line ahead, Guns in securing position trained fore and aft.\n\nThe German vessels were business like craft but appeared much neglected. The \"Emden\" had the \"Iron Cross\" painted on her bows, an award from the Kaiser because of the exploits of her predecessor, destroyed by HMAS \"Sydney\" off the Cocos Islands in November 1914.\n\nWith the Grand Fleet was the \"Amiral Aube\" a French Man O’War representing the French Navy.\n\nThe C in C Grand Fleet had given orders for Inspecting parties to be put on board the German ships. Hereunder is the order of allotment.\n\n2nd BCS\n\n(Australia – Hindenburg\n\n(New Zealand – Derfflinger (Von der Tann)\n\n(Indomitable – \n\n(Inflexible – Moltke\n\n2nd L.C.S.\n\n(Birmingham – Karlsruhe\n\n(Sydney – Frankfurt\n\n(Melbourne – Emden\n\n(Yarmouth – Nurnberg\n\n3rd L.C.S.\n\n(Chatham – Coln\n\n(Birkenhead – Brummer\n\n(Chester – Brense\n\n(Southampton –\n","1159":" B.S.\n\n(Revenge – Bayern\n\n(Resolution – Grosser Kurfurst\n\n(Royal Sovereign – Kron Prinz Wilhelm\n\n(Royal Oak – Markgraf\n\n(Canada – Kaiserin\n\n(Emperor of India – Frederick der Grosse\n\n(Benbow – Konig Albert\n\n(Iron Duke – Prinz Regent Luitpold\n\n(Marborough – Kaiser\n\nThe attitude of inspecting parties was ordered to be as follows – \"Our attitude is to be courteous but not even distantly friendly.\"\n\nOrder Of The British Fleet Escorting Units Of The German High Sea Fleet Into Harbour For Internment.\n\nAs ships other than those detailed for guard duties passed the C in C in Flag Ship Queen Elizabeth they gave him a raising cheer. In the evening a service of thanksgiving was held by Command of the C in C on his flag ship and he recommended the same course to be carried out by all Admirals, and naturally his wishes were carried out.\n\nAdmiral Halsey of \"Australia\" presented me with his flag flown on this memorable day and I shall keep it as a valued memento of the German surrender and in due course pass it on to my naval sons.\n\nLeft \"Australia\" at 6 PM, for Rosyth dock, calling on Admiral Levison in \"Barham\" and Admiral Robinson in \"New York\" on my way. Took train for London at 10.30 PM\n","1160":"\n\nWith Col. SoMerville arrived in London at 10.30 AM. Attended to correspondence during afternoon.

En alors, nous avons assiste a ce spectacle a jamais inoubliable que l’Histoire avec nous rapportement a nos arrieres petits enfants: l’immense empire britannique mettant en oeuvre toutes ses resources au service de la civilisation avec sa flotte toujours Invincible les armees de tous les pays unis a l’empire.\n\nS’il y eut une veritable emulation entre toutes ces Armees, L'Armee Australienne fut parmi celles qui ont conquis le plus de lauriers sur les glorieux champs de bataille. Deja malgre l’occupation et la censeuse boche nous avions appris pas des\n\njourneaux intendits les actions d’eclat ete votre brillant Armee. Maintenant nous savons officiellement combien ces renseigements etaient en dessous de la realite. C’est pour cette raison que l’Administration communale de Marcinelle est fiere de recevoir aujourd’hui un des chefs de cette belle armee et de vous dire a vous, General, et aux brillants officiers sous vos ordres toute notre admiration pour votre bravure et les actes d’heroisme qui perpeteurent votre memoire et glorifieront votre pays.\n\nNous regrettons profondement que notre petite commune n’ait pas les ressources et les attraits qu’une ville presente pour recevoir dignement et avec tout l’eclat qu’elle merite une armee de heros qui s’est couverte d’artant de lauriers que L'Armee Australienne dans cette lutte gigantesque coutre la barbarie.\n\nMais croyez le bien General que notre reconnaissance et notre admiration n’en sont que plus profondes. J’ai la conviction que pendant votre trop court sejour parmi nous vous trouverez au sein de la population l’accueil le plus cordial et le plus fraternal. De son cote l’Administsration communale et les divers services communaux feront l’impossible pour vous donner toutes les facilities desirables.\n\nEn agissant ainsi nous savons que ces temoignages n’exprimeront qu’insuffisament toute la reconnaissance dout nous vous Sommes redevables.\n\nC’est guide pas ces sentiments qu’au nom de l’Administration Communale je leve mon verre a vous, General, a vous, officiers d’elite, a la brillante Armee Australienne a la grande Armee britannique.\"\n\nI made reply as follows:-\n\nMy dear Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,\n\nI deeply appreciate the honour you have shown to myself and my troops by thus welcoming us here today as representatives of the British Army, and expressing your thanks for what service has been rendered to Belgium.\n\nWe all realise what a debt of gratitude the whole world owes to the Courageous King of Belgium and his people, for was it not due to the splendid efforts of the Belgian Army in holding back the advancing German hordes that the British Divisions were able to take their places in the battle line in sufficient time to ward off disaster.\n\nGreat Britain has even been a Champion of right as against wrong, and her Dominions have ever and will ever rally round her in time of trouble.\n\nWe can fully sympathise with you in the troubles and sorrows you have suffered, but, thank God, the enemy has been decisively beaten and your country and France are both now free, free to reestablish your towns, your industries and your homes.\n\nI am pleased to hear your reference to the British Navy. We shall never know just how much it has performed, but this we assuredly know, that but for its unceasing watchfulness the British Army could not have been maintained in Europe nor the American Army landed here.\n\nI had the proud privilege recently of spending a short holiday with the Grand Fleet, and witnessed such a sight as I never expected to see, and certainly will never see again – the surrender of the German Fleet, the final admission of all of the superiority of the British Navy.\n\nI thank you for your kindly references to our Australian Army. When war was first declared our country at once decided to give all the assistance possible and I think we may today fairly claim that the Australian troops have been of sterling value.\n\nWe have in the first place contributed a Battle Cruiser, 3 light Cruisers and several Destroyers, all of which are serving with the British Fleet. We have contributed over 350,000 men and 800 nurses who are distributed through all theatres of war. We have maintained 5 Divisions in Europe and 2 Mounted Divisions in Palestine – all voluntarily – and every penny of the cost is being borne by Australia.\n\nWe have fought in Egypt, Palestine, Gallipoli, France and Belgium. In your country we have taken part in much hard fighting notably at Messines and Passchendaele. It was my privilege to have at one time under my Command for a period of 3 months, six batteries of Belgian Field Artillery, and they always did their work most ably and gallantly.\n\nMany brave lives have been lost, but we all feel that no sacrifice is too great to ensure our old time liberties being maintained.\n\nThe troops you see here to day represent but one battalion\n\nof my 15,000 troops, which will be today established in the area to the south of Marcinelle.\n\nIn making our preliminary billetting arrangements we have already experienced the greatest kindness and I am quite sure our stay among you will be to us a very happy time indeed and a very pleasant change from our years of fighting.\n\nWhile I am sure you will all welcome the day when all troops will quit your dwellings, yet I know you will appreciate the change of Australian soldiers for German, and we on our part will do all we can to reduce to a minimum the inconvenience our being in your midst must necessarily cause you.\n\nBrother Australian officers I ask you to drink most heartily the health of the Burgomaster of Marcinelle and his Colleagues.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the Ceremony two dear little girls presented me with flowers and made a sweet little speech.\n\nAll troops reported settled in their respective areas.\n","1189":"\n\nToday we have had a most interesting run. Charley and Major MacCallum accompanied me. We left Charleroi in the early morning, passed through Namur and Liege to Spa and from Spa across country to Namur is beautiful and most interesting.

In Louvain we saw the mark of Hun incendiaries, the Cathedral and other buildings having been badly damaged by fire 10 days after the Boche occupation.\n\nHere also we took some photos. Service being conducted in the Cathedral to the accompaniment of a very fine Military Band.\n\nAt Maline (a fine town with some fine buildings) had a most interesting interview with Cardinal Mercier well known as a staunch Belgian patriot and one who had suffered much at the hands of the Germans. He told us much of interest and on our leaving presented us each with an autograph photo of himself.\n\nLunch at Brussells – very expensive – 145 francs for a simple lunch for 4 – a very fine city and one that I shall again visit at an early date.\n\nMonday 23rd December\n\nStayed in all day attending to correspondence. Pope took Charley to see Mons, Valenciennes, Arras, Cambrai and Le Cateau.

A total of 28 persons sat down to an excellent repast and afterwards we had some speech making, dancing and music. In conformity with custom, as host I had to have one dance with every lady capable of dancing – rather an ordeal considering I have not danced a step since leaving Australia. Guests seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves.\n","1194":"\n\nWith Charley and Pope left Charleroi at 8.15 AM for Boulogne. Travelled via Mons and Tournai to Lille where I introduced Charley to Gens. White, Grant & Hamon. Lunched at Army HQrs. Afterwards met Gen. Hart of NZ Division returning from south of France to his Brigade and promised to pick him up on my return journey tomorrow. Also saw Gen. Eller of Tank Corps in Lille. Proceeded on via Menen, and Ghehurst to Ypres. Very desolate country, absolutely devastated ground nothing but shell holes, trees nothing but shattered stumps, villages effaced, concrete pill boxes smashed, derelict tanks in plenty, masses of wire and many isolated graves. Quite the most suitable spot to take a visitor who wishes to really see what war can mean. Ypres quite flat and absolutely ruined. Went on to Boulogne via Cassell, St. Omer & Desvres. Dined at Folkestone Hotel and took rooms at Hotel de Paris.\n","1195":"\n\nCharley left by boat at 9.30 AM, having I am sure thoroughly enjoyed his leave.

At Lille again lunched at Army HQrs. Picked up Gen. Hart and brought him back to Charleroi via Valenciennes and Mons. He will go on from here by rail to Cologne. Arrived at my HQrs. at 8 PM Found Major MacCallum had departed for Australia. A very good officer and a gentleman – whose work has been of sterling value – I am sorry to lose him.\n","1196":"\n\nGen.
