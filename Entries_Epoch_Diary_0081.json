\n\n","1":"\n\nLeft port at 2.00 P.M. Put back into port 3.0 P.M. came out again & turned up Manly side (South) then turned once more & finally took up our course (North) . Some of the Boys sick already Quambi lost his false teeth while hanging over the side. Corp Offord is coming with us.\n","2":" about 11.0 AM.\n\nI have been sick twice this morning & had to camp on Deck last night simply couldn’t trust myself downstairs. Joe Martin is sea sick too, one fellow said this crowd was the quietest lot of Soldiers he had seen – good reason why about ¾ of them were sick. Their faces are perfectly green. None of the Middies are sick. All the Officers were very bad in fact they put Tonkin in the Hospital which made the boys very cheerfull. We have a very tin Kiffley piano on board but there seem to be plenty of very good players. A chap on board with a one string\n\nfiddle is a splendid player. I met Joe Sellars here he is in the 2nd Battalion. This sea sickness is hanging on me pretty tight, I feel squalmish all the time & I can’t vomit of course. I have done so pretty often but it won’t come for me most of the time.\n","3":"\n\nHave managed to eat two meals and hold on to them but am not yet sure of keeping them. Slept on deck last night & nearly perished with the cold. We have passed Melbourne now 12.00 midday & they seem to be preparing for heavy weather so I can see good times coming for me. I turned the ship inside out looking for soda water before Dinner & couldn’t get any still I managed some soup & Bread & Butter. A lemon would have been usefull.\n","4":"\n\nNow well in the bight. Still feel squeamish, we are packed like sardines. The amount of gambling is astonishing. I had the bad luck to break my fountain pen today.\n\n11.3.16\n\nA chap passed me on the stairs last night and as he passed he said “If I’m not better tomorrow I hope to Christ I’m dead & that’s just how I felt at the time.\n","5":"\n\nSea Sickness seems to be leaving me now. I have already had two good meals. Mess orderly today. A man fell down the hatch this morning & broke his collar bone. We have had splendid weather so far. No chance of getting exercise here we are packed like sardines.\n","6":"\n\nAmong the Coo ees there is a chap with a voice like Will Oaklands, he is a lovely singer. The man who fell down the hatch is pretty bad suffering from internal injuries he never wasted any time\n\n \n\n13th Monday\n\nin getting himself counted out. I am on water picket now today supposed to be two hours on & two hours off, all day but I don’t think I will do that I shall want 4 hours off. I find that I shall have to put up with 2. I have been unable to drink tea ever since I came on board.\n","7":" \n1st Letter\n \n\nInoculated again today it seems to be becoming a habit. There is to be a concert tonight. Great excitement this afternoon when we sighted 3 ships at once. Sighted 3 or 4 islands at about 6.0 P.M. Rather a heavy roll on this evening.\n","8":"\n\nWe had a concert last night but the items tendered were only fair. We have turned north again so the weather is becoming warmer, it will soon be necessary to sleep on deck, also to do some\n\n15th Wednesday\n\nalso do some washing.\n","9":"\n\nhave not seen land since last friday except those islands it is pretty certain now that we will go straight to Colombo from Sydney without a stop. we will be lucky if there is no disease on board considering the crowd. our Company the 17th are a very honest crowd a fellow can leave anything about in perfect security.

I only got 10\/- its true but I shall get the \n\nrest in Egypt. When we were paraded to be paid the officer said open your pay Books at page 8 every man did & while they were standing by with their pay Books in their hands some one started “Onward Christian Soldiers\" & every man started & they sang the Hymn right through despite every effort to stop them, the Officers had to laugh. We had the opening rounds of a boxing Tournament last night.\n","11":"\n\nNothing doing\n","12":"\n\nChurch parade. No priest on board so the Colonel presided & we said the Rosary & sang God save the King.\n","13":"\n\nFatigue today officiated as squee-gee artist finished up at 11.0 AM for the day.

The Ships Quartermaster Butler went down to Appendicitis today?\n","18":"\n\nArrived at Colombo today plenty of cocoanut palms paddles like spoons. Yankee Boat with an American flag painted 4 times on each side & the name “City of Savannah\" in between. We are to be allowed ashore tomorrow for a couple of hours. The Harbor is entirely an artificial one. the town looks very pretty from the ocean side the first thing we struck was fishing Boats before we neared the land at all. labor must be cheap here we see them towing big barges filled with sand. The coolies are now coaling the ship. We\n\n8 P.M.\n\narrived in Harbor at about 4.30 P.M.\n","19":"\n\nA N.Z. Trans. 48 (No) arrived in Port this morning. We are to go ashore at 10 A.M. the time is now 8.30 but everyone is ready & so excited that most of them do not know what they are doing. There is a British Cruiser in the Harbor the I believe & also a Japanese war vessel. The Nigs here are no great shakes at diving at all The NZ Transport 47 is here too the two came in together. The 48 is the Topua & the 47 is the Willochra, some of the N.Z. are staying here & others are going to India (Wireless). Seen deformed kiddie potato foot. Fluted tiles on Houses in native quarter. Beautiful roads, small Bananas, lovely beach, white women scarce, Ride on Ricksha. The Nids broke away & had\n\nthe time of their lives hiring Rickshas & a guide and went all over Colombo.\n\npoor me I was turned back quick & lively & had to come back with the soldiers\n\nA vessel with the French\n \n\nwe saw plenty of of the quaintest little dollies of babies I ever expect to see. We had a swim in the Harbor tonight the water was quite Hot but the boys mucked up with the boats in the vicinity frightening them. One of the Nigs stood\n\n up in the boat & pointing to the water yelled out “Fish “Fish\" I think he meant to frighten us by saying “Shark\" but\n\nthey took no notice anyhow and darned nearly upset the boat. The Nids sent some presents away. In our route march we only seen the Native Quarter. The roads are magnificent & beautifully clean. We only seen three white women and about 4 black ones altogether here. We are coaling here & there is a coating about an inch thick everywhere. All the Native shops are open on Sunday the same as on week days. The troops got a set of gloves & started the Nigs fighting, in the dark too. The show was easily worth 2\/6 admission.\n","20":"\n\nA Victorian Transport the A.18 (Wiltshire) arrived this morning. On Guard today. A Mob of the Boys Just broke away on a coal lighter \n and \n as soon as I came off Guard I managed to climb down a rope onto a Lighter. we were towed away to the Breakwater ---- & got into town. Hired a Ricksha & had a trip round the native quarter. in the fruit market we saw numbers of cripples & cadgers of all kinds they were hanging on to our skirts all the time. Some of the Boys bought tiny monkeys. An indelible pencil cost me 5d & a shawl for Mac 5\/6. Registered same (813) No. The P.O. is a fine building with plenty of native attendants to show anyone about. the native police are very efficient & obliging. We returned to the ship about 10 min before she pulled out of the Harbor. during the night lighters of\n\nTroops kept coming on board up till about midnight. Shortly afterward the steamer took her departure for Egypt. I believe some of the boys are still ashore but they’ll have to stay there now. When she left I was in the Hospital. Had a fearfull time was absolutely poisoned, nearly everyone who went ashore was more or less sick. On top of that some of the late arrivals brought fines ranging from 5-0-0 to £15-0-0.\n","21":"\n\nDischarged from hospital this morning. Am alright but the inside of my stomach is absolutely raw. The ship & everything on board are simply filthy.\n","22":"\n\nI believe the months loss of pay has been lifted from the fines mentioned above, that brings the penalty down to 5-0-0.\n","23":" \n\nEpidemic of mumps on board over 40 patients.

Wright has about a dozen fits a day & Blanchard nearly as many. they are almost certain to be sent back. The Hospitals are crowded now. Was having a yarn with a Coo-ee today a housebreaker.

It must be a lonely job. Hot as Hell no, Hotter than any hell. We passed another Islet with a lighthouse the name of it sounds like The heat (5.0 PM) tween decks is something awefull everybody practically naked & the perspiration running off them in streams slopping off their arms onto the table like water. The smell of man is something terrific not dirty but caused by abnormal sweating. I have been doing a little boxing lately & feel the benefit of it, shall keep it up untill we land if possible. We must be in the danger zone now because the lights are masked now\n","29":"\n\nLetters to Harry Mick & Mollie last night.\n","30":"\n\nWe passed a ship today the Neuralis probably a hospital ship. A small bird like a canary came on board yesterday while we were out of sight of land we were also visited by Grasshoppers. We were medically inspected today and informed that we would disembark on Sunday next. The 17th will be duty company on that date.\n","31":"\n\nArrived at Port Suez this morning & found all the transports that were at Colombo here & in addition the two russian Transports. We did not land here but left at 6.00 P.M. for Alexandria. Shiels said we\n\nwould call at Port Said tomorrow at Sunset he also informed us that \nthe 1st & 2nd Divisions were in France & that we would probably go there from Alexandria. Port suez is connected to Suez Proper by a narrow Isthmus along which runs a Railway line. There is a Hospital at the South end of the canal. There is a Military camp on the opposite side to Port Suez. Some of the Soldiers said they were the Essex. They were camped on a most desolate spot sand everywhere it must be Hell when a wind blows. The canal at its entrance is very narrow the channel proper is hardly wider than L. Hardt canal. I was told it was 88 miles\n\nlong. We passed the Osterley at Port Suez & put our Mails on board so Mac ought to get that mail about the first week in May.\n","32":"\n\nWe arrived at Port Said at about 8.30 A.M. All the way along the canal was practically one continuous camp of Territorials among others the Essex East & West Kent Yeomanry, Royal Edinburgh Engineers 1st &","33":" Argyles the last were encamped at Madalla some of the camps had barbed wire Entanglements they had also small rifle ranges. We passed the Steamer Minos on the way. There is a railway all the way along the East Bank & Military railway along the West Bank near the camps. Nowhere is the land more than about 12 feet above sea level. The East Bank has plenty of verdure but the rest is simply sand. One of the Britishers said are you downhearted the boys answered \nNo\n he said “you ---- soon would be if you were here\n\nthe country is mostly under water especially on the Railway side. We are coaling now. The niggers here can beat the Colombo mob out of sight at Coaling they carry fair sand Baskets & they move very quickly they sing at their work. The singing is painful to listen to. There are plenty of Bumboats around here & also a number of men-of-war in port nearly all French. There is also a number of Hospital ships including the “Gloucester Castle\". A chap offered to dive under the Ship for 4\/- but there were no takers. There is a French woman & a coloured one rowing around the Ship playing & singing for coins, they catch the coins in an umbrella. We thought we were going ashore & mustered up in Marching Order to be told that we had to go on to Alexandria. I suppose we will be sent on from there to France direct there is a rumour that we are to have a gun mounted on Board. More ominous signs a 4.7 gun with ammunition was hoisted on\n\nboard & mounted on the stern while a special Submarine Gaurd was told off with Rifles fixed Bayonets & Ball cartridge. We put all our hospital cases ashore here Mumpies, Veneareals & general, the Z 16 Toronto from Salonika left here this evening. We lost the Southern Cross in the Red Sea. Ever since we left the Red Sea the Weather has been getting cooler it is now quite cold of an evening.\n","34":"\n\nAnother change of plans we are to land at 9.0 AM & entrain for Tel-el-Kebir & Bob has already left there for France. What bad luck. I seen the Niggers Trawling for coal today. They run a trawl net across the place where the lighters were coaling the Ship then haul it up, empty it & continue they use a rowing boat with two men one to row the other to haul up the net. Not a bad scheme, but a poor way of earning a living.\n\nThe Niggers have no sense of decency yesterday a white girl was singing from a boat & one of the niggers coaling from a barge a few yards away relieved himself while squatting on the side wiped himself with a piece of coal & went on with his work they actually relieve themselves over the side of the port. They are much better men physically than the Cingalese. The boys gave them a bad time yesterday bombarding them with potatoes they made one (a policeman) so wild that he started throwing stones back at them from the shore. They annoyed the coalies until the latter threatened to retaliate then a gaurd was put over the potatoes. I was unconsciously the means of causing a great deal of inconvenience to a number of our boys on a lighter.\n","35":"\n\nWe are now at Tel-el-Kebir after a 4 hour Railway ride from Port Said. This place seems to be healthy enough the sanitary arrangements are efficient\n\nbut laughable one part consists of tubes arranged in fours like funnels, these are for urinating.\n\nThere some aeroplane tents at Port Said. We seen an aeroplane Sailing over Port Suez. There was an anti-air gun at Kantara. There are some Indian lancers patrolling the Suez – Cairo line. They are splendid looking fellows in appearance. Tel-el-Kebir is on the sweat water canal there is a microbe in the water which enters the body by the sweat Glands & causes an incurable complaint we are not allowed to bathe or wash in it. There seems very little chance of getting to Cairo now. I applied for a transfer to the Engineers or Field Artillery. A lot of us were detailed for carting wood this afternoon we acted as horses. The natives here sell mixtures of urine & raw spirit to the men as Whisky, Brandy Etc. they are incredibly dirty in their habits & their methods of washing fruit.\n","36":"\n\nWent to the Circus last night. A fair show by a French & Egyptian Crowd the clowns were the biggest mugs I ever seen. There was a little Kid there about 3 years old whose name must have been Isaac by the way in which he rushed the coins thrown in the Ring. They say that we will get chatty soon on this ground. We have had a terrific dust storm during the last 24 hours sand storm I should say. I was booked up for Quarter gaurd to-day.\n","37":"\n\nThe Niddries have just been advised that they will be transferred to Ferry’s post. But they won’t go.\n","38":"\n\nVisited Cairo today. Its wonderfull what big vessels sail up the little gutter we call Sweat water canal. The native cemetries have monuments made of sun\n\n& in the wider streets the traffic was very heavy, so altogether the Donkey ride wasn’t a success from my point of view. Anyway we went all over the Wassa and around some of the principle Streets & had lunch at the Y.M.C.A. in Eskebiah Gardens of course we called in at several of the Cabarets & had drinks etc meantime watching the performance & listening to the singing, Music, Dancing, we also seen a fair amount of cuddling none of the girls had too much on. Most of these Egyptians seem to spend a lot of their time in the Cafes playing Dominoes & Backgammon these games are wonderfully popular. In some of the principal streets with traffic as heavy as George St Sydney the majority of the houses on both sides are drums as far as their upper stories are concerned in one street near the womens Hospital nearly all the houses on one side were brothels. In the upper stories they had small balconies sticking out like bay windows\n\n& in every one of these balconies were several women or girls big fleshy ones too with small chemises without sleeves reaching scarcely to the thigh & a tiny lace V underneath. The part underneath that shaven. these ladies took particular pains to stand near the edge of the balcony & in some case astride the balcony rail in case you couldnt see enough & all the time they were capering & singing & calling to the soldiers in the street below. The police took absolutely no notice of them no matter what they done or what filthy suggestion they made. In the Wassa proper the ladies ? sit on chairs in the street with the shortest of skirts practically none in fact, flash stockings & the gaudy High legged high heeled boots & some of them wear heavy bangles as well they are nearly all very plump. We put in most of the day in Wassa much to my disgust & explored most of the Joy houses but did not do any business with them\n\nalthough we paid others to do so. We were also lucky enough to see an Egyptian Wedding almost in front of the Concordia. Another interesting place was the womens hospital here some very fine looking women were congregated in the small balcony perfectly happy & inviting onlookers to come right in & jig jig & there were some onlookers too because quite a number go in to see it. There are some fine Hotels at two of them Sheppards & another there is a picket to keep Soldiers out. No decent women or Girl in Cairo will look at a Soldier. I think our fellows must have played the devil there because even the roughest of the people seem terribly frightened of them. One incident speaks for itself. A woman was sitting on the footpath right against the wall with a Jar of some sort of food which she was trying to sell when she noticed us coming along she took up her jar walked right out in the street waited until we had passed & then took up her old position. We could’nt have gone near her\n\nwithout going out of our way to do so but yet she would’nt trust us. About 30 of our fellows are going to Serapium tomorrow.\n","39":"\n\nI took a walk out to the battlefield of Tel-el-Kebir today & put in one of the driest days I have had for a long time. A person cannot realise how necessary water is unless he has walked a few miles in the desert like I did & forgot to take his water bottle with him. to resume, the trenches that were made at that time are still there today there are miles & miles of them all over the place & relics of the battle can still be found by any one who cares to look. Old cartridges parts of equipment, buckles, bullets plenty of bones more of them than anything else. I found a few cartridge cases & will send them home at earliest opportunity. There is a rumour here in fact it seems more than a rumour that about a month \n\nUnder Brigadier Irving they done 15 miles first day 20 second & 6 the third\n\nago a Brigade done a march to Ismalia or Ferrys Post & that on the way the water gave out & they had to send out a party to them it is said that 8 of them died another shot himself & a number of others were more or less exhausted the O.C. was court-martialled ? \n\nOne letter to Mac.\n","40":"\n\nA fair crowd left her today for an unknown destination.\n\nReceived a letter from Mac\n\nAll the men excepting the gaurd were paid today. All the returned men here can be picked out they are generally hard cases. I am on quarter gaurd today again and at present very hungry I seem unable to get enough\n","41":"\n\nThis morning for the first time I seen a man overhauling his shirt for live stock.\n\nThey are certainly economical with the food here. I seem to be hungry all the time especially since I came on this gaurd. We have been issued with less than 3 loaves of bread to 22 men & one tiny slice of Bacon\n","42":" \n\nI was on Cooks fatigue today with two Old Soldiers whose sole ambition was to get back to Australia no matter how both had been wounded & after recovery put in all their time scheming. one chap was 3 months in Hospital until the Doctor as a last resort decided on an operation he hung out until actually on the table & \nthen\n said he would not have any --- operation on \nHim\n & left the Hospital but they can’t make him work. Some of the boys are very cunning they have a method of making their knees swell by means of towels & continuously knocking at each side unfortunately the swelling goes down too soon, chewing Cordite is another scheme a very old one. The Doctors are no less cunning one took a party of cripples\n\nto the pyramids and all of them who accompanied the Doctor on a walk around the Pyramid were sent back to their units. Another crowd of Cripples had a football thrown to them & the resulting performances of a number caused them to be sent back. another time they were called up for their pay. Condensed milk was sometimes used by the men but is now too old fashioned deafness is a common complaint & leads to some amusing results. A man being Spoken to quietly about leaving a door open as he left the room apologised & went back to his unit. All the old hands seem to take a fiendish delight in shaking things up all around. There is a fairly good concert going on now. The Prince of Wales is expected to visit this camp soon.\n\n23-4-16 Easter Sunday\n\nUp at 5.0 A.M. as usual and started on Fatigues also as usual. We get up at 5 every morning but don’t have breakfast till 9\n\nAfter breakfast we again were asked to fall in for more Fatigue but I did not do so but went to the other side of the Canal to cut out time. It would be a God send to have a swim here but there is not only the germs to consider but the natives use it as a Latrine. No wonder their children look as if they were poisoned. It is a pitifull sight to see the Gippos standing gaurd over the garbage pits at meal times they watch the stuff & sort it out & a lot of stuff that a starved Sydney dog would turn his nose up at is turned into the food tin & the rest into the refuse tins. They eat the first lot. I seen one kid with a boot shining outfit put his hand into the box among the brushes etc. & take out a crust so hard that it rang like a biscuit bite a bit off & put it back among his polishing utensils.\n\n25th April Easter Tuesday & Anzac Day\n\nHad a look at sports but left early & sent the programme to Mollie, Cissy & Jersey Rd. Was talking to one of the peninsular Boys, who told me of the death of Major Quinn 15th Batt. who\n\ngot killed while leading the 14th in a charge he was caught by a Machine gun as he cleared the parapet & nearly cut in two his last words were come on \n\nThe 13th Batt. also blame the","43":" for not supporting them at .\n\nThe \nRoyal Marine light\n Infantry ran away at Their initials R.M.L.I now stand for \nRun My Laddies Imshi\n The Aussys often had to charge & recover trenches which they had held previous to handing them over to the Tommies the latter saying they’re chummy and .

When the Australians made prisoners on the peninsular the Ghurka’s used to ask for them if the request was granted it was the end of the prisoner. there is no doubt that the Turks were brave they used to come right up to the parapet of the trenches in the night & sometimes peer over. They were very good at constructing entanglements by night it was no use sending flares up because the tiny glow of the fuse used to betray them & they took cover before it burst. Our Boys used to burrow to a possy halfway between the trenches & then break through overhead & wait there every night with Bombs in anticipation of an attack they would’nt waste bombs on small parties\n","50":" \n\nI took a day of today to see the Pyramids.

The most striking exhibit is the mummy of the original Pharaoh Rameses II & also that of his father. \n\nI must here refer to the squeaker used by the Tram Conductors to start their Trams\n\nit sounds like a childs penny Trumpet. After Dinner at the Anzac Hostel we went to the Ghizeh Zoo the most conspicuous features of this place to me are its pathways which are very original consisting of mosaic work done with pebbles & also with a marble border & the Grottoes which have numbers of different marine animals finished off with pebbles artificial rock work and most artistic coral work. another curious feature is the cosmopolitan character of its frequenters. while we were\n\nthere we seen reps of N.Z.

Yesterday some Infantry (17th & others) & A.M.C. men came with us. After a rough trip we arrived here (Alexandria) at about 3.00 AM & embarked on the “Corsican\" We have A.M..C. – A.S.C. Field Artillery & Pioneers on board. The Tucker promises to be pretty good. The trip last night was a rough experience for a good many judging by the remarks “Keep your feet out of my stomach\" youre hurting me etc. There was from 30 to 36 in each truck naturally they were tied up in true lovers knots – it was very cold too. Wonderful to relate I slept through most of it. I shall have to try & get some of my photos away if I can.\n","75":" 29 Monday 5-16\n\nLeft Alexandria this morning at about 8.00 escorted by a couple of Destroyers & also accompanied by about ½ Doz. Trawlers. We have all got to wear life belts all day & keep them close at night. Our Boots have to be unlaced. all lights have to be out at 7.0 P.M. This is my worst experience in a Troopship so far. The Tucker is not much good & the management as in all military affairs rotten. Tonight we had to change places with the A.M.C. The time selected for the change was tea time with the result that there was terrific confusion & some of the tables drew double rations & others none & there was no effort on the Officers part to square things up. The smell here between decks is something awfull simply smells like a morgue all the portholes are closed to \nexclude?\n darken the Portholes.\n","76":"\n\nWe are yawing about all the time & in front there is a destroyer criss-crossing our track. There are also 3 other War vessels on the Horizon. it does’nt look as if they are taking chances we have a 6\" gun at the stern. One of the Gun Crew said that she\n\nwould shake the mounting to pieces if she were fired. I had a shave under difficulties this morning with a Bully Beef tin, some Coffee, Broken Glass & using my Belt for a Strop. On Torpedo gaurd today. A few dozen at a time are placed around the ship with orders to keep a look out for periscopes & if they see one to fire at it if they are sure of hitting it but if not to keep firing between it & the ship to stop it from aiming I believe. \nThese?\n The gaurd have to have their boots off & a life belt on. These lifebelts are a dam nuisance they take up so much room we can’t pass each other comfortably anywhere. we keep forgetting to allow for the lifebelt and get jammed in the narrow passages nor can we find room enough to sit at the tables, however the tucker is so bad that it reduces our bulk & tends to equalize matters. We are having lovely weather.\n","77":" ","78":"\n","79":"\n\nFinished our turn of Gaurd & arrived down below to find that we had changed our quarters for the second time within two days as before there was terrific confusion all our gear being mixed up. So far I have only lost my Blanket but some fellows have lost everything\n\nand are doing their best to acquire a new Kit, a man wants the eyes of Argus to watch & the arms of Briarius to defend his kit. Someone will have to provide that Blanket. We have 2700 men on board that would be a lovely haul for a Submarine. With the crew we have 3000 souls. This probably accounts for the number of escorts we have had all through the trip we have been handed on from one to another of these there is sometimes 3 in view at once. several times we have passed the Trawlers mine sweeping frequently they zig zag in front of us for a time. The most comical sight of all is to see a big Troopship with a fussy little Torpedo boat running round & across her like a little pup gambolling around its mother. I heard a funny expression from Sapper Edwards this evening something relating to holding a cat the meaning being this is my business. In the extremely cold weather just before the evacuation of Gallipoli, sometimes the parapets of both trenches would be lined with benumbed soldiers incapable of firing a rifle. The Trenches being flooded with icy water. Running a house\n\ngame is a good way of making money on a Troopship in this way it is easy to make a pound or two per day. On one occasion on the Peninsula D. Co. of the 8th was sniping A. Co. This mistake being due to the trench lines being irregular & very close together.\n","80":"\n\nWe had a submarine scare yesterday a destroyer dashed away from our escort & almost immediately the alarm was sounded & all hand mustered at their boat stations. And there we stayed lifebelts & Boots as usual untill darkness came on (we had ½ hour for tea. in the meantime our O.C. addressed the company & said that bad news had been received & we were to hold ourselves ready to act coolly & quietly in the event of trouble. After the alarm had been sounded the Steamer started steaming at her best & Zig Zagging even more than usual which is saying a lot. Everything passed off O.K. & today we have lovely weather. We passed a big Battleship this morning The colonel made a speech this afternoon, he said that when we reached England we would hear bad news & would be appalled at the narrow escape we had had. I take this to mean that one of our\n\nConsorts was torpedoed yesterday. It is wonderfull what a craving for sweets a man develops on active service. Big rough fellows can be seen scrambling for toffee or lollies as if they were children they are nearly as popular as cigarettes & more popular than Beer.\n","81":"\n\nWe have had the African coast in sight all day. On this trip while in the Mediterranean we have hardly ever lost sight of land either on one side or the other. But lately it is always to the south (African)\n","82":" letters to Mac. 1 to Kids\n","83":"\n\nArrived at Gibraltar last night at 8.0 P.M. The Rock itself from the harbor side reminds one of Mount Solitary at Katoomba. On the lower slopes & climbing up the hillside can be seen a small town, the lights of which look very pretty at night time clustering along the waters edge with the black Rock towering above. There are plenty of search lights here, they were playing around the ship all last night. We have just (8.0 A.M.) come into the inner harbor which is protected by Booms \n\nThe spanish coast looks like the South coast of new South Wales but the villages are white instead of Black. The Rock itself \n\nWater sheds, Paths, cottages, village or town, Harbor inner, coal stage, Main Harbor, Mainly landlocked\n\nOne side of the rock looks like an old Ivory Brooch, the other side rises sheer? There are plenty of war craft about including a Submarine. There was a rumour on Board yesterday about a naval engagement in the North Sea. There is only a strip of sand connecting Gibraltar with the Spanish coast, Somewhat similar to Nobbys at Newcastle. The Rock itself looks very pretty from the inner harbor side. There was some gun practice going on & the echoes were very perfect. It took the sound a long time to travel to us nearly ½ a minute for about a mile. When you are close to the Rock, it looks exactly like a picture because it rises so rapidly & ends so abruptly that the houses & trees look as if they were painted on it. It is like a slice of cake in fact.\n","84":"\n\nLeft Gibraltar at 7.30 A.M. The men scrambled money to the Coal lumpers yesterday evening & it was one of the funniest shows I have ever\n\nseen you could first see a white dusky legs & flashing teeth. Alarm sounded today just before dinner while I was washing myself & a towel. In my hurry to get upstairs I dropped my wristlet watch. When I got a chance to look for it it was gone.\n","85":"\n\nI have discovered a blanket & hope to keep it. We are now in the Atlantic & have left our escort behind but we are still doing a little dodging.\n","86":"\n\nOn torpedo gaurd again today. Was called out yesterday & offered section leader but refused. Weather becoming much colder.

We must be entering a new danger zone.\n","88":"\n\nPicked up another escort this morning Destroyer or Torpedo 85. Evidently still possibility of Submarine attack because the escort signalled instructions of what to do in that event.

British time & entrained for Parkhouse Camp Salisbury We arrived at the camp about 4.50 A.M. after wandering & loosing ourselves several times. We left the station at about 3.10 A.M. This is the best camp I have ever seen. We got a very cordial reception when we landed the crowd consisting mostly of women & children unfortunately a number were in Black. The 2 weeks we were on the boat were most unlucky ones for the Allies on the Sea. I seen something that surprised one to night that was the Sun setting at 9.20 P.M. This is partly due to the daylight saving Bill but that does’nt wholly account for it. The sun sets much later here than I would have believed possible if I didn’t see it myself. at Midsummer they must’nt have any darkness at all, because even after sunset there is still a long twilight. \n","89":"\n\nMuch struck by the beauty of the landscapes around here and all the way up in the train the country was just as lovely. The beauty of the hedges is very striking after\n\nEgypt also the groves of trees. One curious sight I seen was a large field devoted to entrenchments. The subsoil is practically all chalk & the white parapets of the trenches lying in geometrical patterns on the green field looked very pretty. Some of the Hills looked as if they were capped with Snow. \n","90":"\n\nApplied for leave (Weekend) and much to my surprise got it. Intend to go to London tomorrow.\n","91":"\n\nRealised a cherished ambition & seen London. Stopped at Union Jack Club opp. Waterloo Station. Only had 36 Hours leave so we kept on the dead run all the time when we were not on the Busses Trams or the Tube. The Girls gave us more than a warm welcome I never got so much glad Eye in my life. They seem to sort out us Australians for special attention in fact everyone was Kind. The lady Bus & Tram Conductors attracted my special attention. They looked very smart in their Uniforms. The Strand by night looked very dull with barely enough light to see our way along. It is a bad time to see London because\n\nplaces of Interest are closed & in Westminster Abbey some of the more valuable relics were covered with Sand bags. There is no water in the Fountains at Trafalgar Square & some of the Historic places are caged in. It is the dearest place to live in I have yet seen one has almost to pay to breathe. One gets nothing for nothing & the traffic is great disappointment too I think it is much overrated.

Attended Church parade there today at an old Norman Church built by the British in 1432. I heard that the trenches at Armentierres are very shallow and practically all parapet. Because the water lies so near the surface. The gas used by the Germans poisons exposed food and cigarettes also. It also colours metal facings & I notice that the wearers \ndon’t\n take pains to remove the discolouration. When the miners Battalion arrived in the Trenches the Germans put up a sign saying “Miners you have got 2 months to live\".

I was all in & just lay down & went to sleep. in addition to our usual load each man carried about 20 lb of Tucker we had been travelling since 5.0 A.M. on our arrival we were greeted with 3 pounds of Shrapnel. I was so tired that I never even got up to have a look at the Show. The church steeple of this town is leaning downwards against the side & has been that way since 1914. A tall chimney in the vicinity has a pronounced bend in it nearly all have this\n\nThe 1st Battalion has I believe been shifted back from the line somewhere.

It transpired later that there was a misunderstanding. Birthday today \n","118":"\n\nAttached to the Battalion 2 Platoon A Co. took up work today on a small tramway. Another experience of Shrapnel fire. There being at least a dozen casualties within 100 yds of our job but that is nothing here.

Was pulled out of bed at midnight last night & warned that a Gas attack was pending. after standing by about ¼ of an hour we were allowed to go back. \n\nThrough the night the Germans shelled our Head Quarters with some new Gas & got the O.C. & the second. The effect of this gas is not felt for 3 Hrs & if I am not mistaken they kept it up for nearly 9 hours. There was plenty of Bodies festering in the sun on the field & shells of all sizes. the 17th got a knock the other night the Germans anticipating a rush placed some machine Guns in positions in shell holes in no mans land & when the 17th rushed they were badly cut up. The following night the Tommies got across without losing a man (the luck of the game). I noticed some of the names of communication trenches. Dinkum Alley, long Alley . The sound of the Shrapnel is really vicious\n\nBut the High Explosive shells sound like a thin sheet of tin being shaken as they travel through the air.\n","121":"\n\nI seen an British Aeroplane brought down yesterday. It dropped straight for ½ way spiralled ¼ & then came end over end to earth. Fritz immediately started splashing shrapnel all around where it fell. He then spathered the head of the rail where we were unloading. We got the rails off in record time & did not linger on the way back. Murphy nearly stopped a H.E. on the way back. We are still on the Pozieres line. The line to the chalk pit is stopped. Noticed a new communication trench today Hun Road. 3 Platoon went out last night to dig com. trench for the hop over party. The Bomb-making party had an explosion. 3 were hurt Sgt. Walker seriously. Last Monday 2 shells premature buried from our own guns dropped alongside of us one within 20 yds. Fritz swept the road for us yesterday but we ducked. But he got one chap going home\n\nOur Boys in the front line are actually fighting in shell holes they can’t stand sit or sleep. All attack have to be made at a walk & I believe the second or third lines attack before the first. In the solid chalk of the trenches live numbers of fat frogs how they get food or water God knows. I was much interested by the struggles of one to climb over my Rubber sheet the sheet was on an incline & Mr Frog could do nothing with it & he was in a Hurry too because I was touching him up behind. Our fellows all wear tin sheets at the back of their neck so that the Artillery shall know them. The 2nd Batt. and the Engineers both refused the job our fellows done last night. The trench in no mans land.\n","122":"\n\nNos 3 & 4 Platoon went out last night to dig out a sap but the fire was too hot, so we (No 2) had to take it on this morning. The Cap. told us 2 other companies had been practically blown out of it but that it \nhad\n to be done. We found it a collection of shell holes & dug it out to within about 200 yds of the firing line before handing it over to the next relief. We got plenty of Shrap. & H.E. from Fritz.\n\nbut owing to my really magnificent ducking I only got a kick in the rear. We dug out a 9\" shell (a dud also a dead Fritz (poor Beggar) he was in an awful state. The chap who got the 9\" shell was very careful with his pick afterward. Our boys wear tin sheets on their Backs so that the artillery won’t fire on them by mistake.\n","123":"\n\nHad the hottest time of my life today went out on the same job as yesterday but we encountered a terrific converging fire of H.E. and Shrapnel the Batteries were sweeping the whole length of the centre way which we were supposed to clean out. \n\nthe part we had done yesterday was all blown in & the trench blown flat. Fritz would’nt leave us alone his shell fire being something awful. at the finish I was sent on a message & got lost in the Trenches.

I hope everything goes off O.K.\n\nLetter to Mac. yesterday\n\nMore names of trenches Rag Lane and Spring Street. There are some German Planes sailing high above our camp tonight trying desperately to find out if there is anything doing. our Battle planes are waiting below like Bull dogs but in vain because the taube keeps too high meanwhile the anti gun is chasing them vainly with shells. On the other side Fritz is Bombarding Albert. I was nearly reported missing this afternoon.\n","124":"\n\nWent up to the firing line at midnight 4th We had to change parapets and dig out trenches as fast as they were blown. Shell fire awfull also machine Guns. The Bullets of the latter were exploding in the air everywhere, they looked like fire flies. I lost the trench (so called) and wandered about in the Orchard or Wood (Pozieres) absolutely without cover & while there met Charley Stead engineers. We kept together after although he did’nt know me. Murphy got a rap on the finger so he did not come out with us today. When the Boys charged they found a man who had been wounded and left in a shell hole 7 days previously in no man’s land. a corporal a few\n\nyards away had food but they could’nt get to each other. I believe he will pull through they gave him a cigarette and he was perfectly happy. The Germans made no fight for the trench but their Barrage fire was awfull. The prisoners were treated well & glad to be taken. Their infantry made a counter attack but when they neared our trench they threw away their arms and dived in. I believe their own Artillery shelled them.\n","125":"\n\nWent out at 6.0 P.M. yesterday and worked carrying rails to the Rail head near the wood. Fritz was as usual very liberal with shells only more so especially at the Rail head. I was nearly run over twice & had one of my puttees almost torn to pieces by a loop of wire projecting from the rails. Fritz followed us all the way home with shells & then kept shelling all night. this persistent shell fire is beginning to make one jumpy. I must make a reference to the free coffee stall near the beginning of Sausage Valley. The guns in the latter place have nearly blown me off the rail several times when walking home by night. A funny incident happened on the night of the charge 4th Divon.\n\nwas digging a communication trench & had just dug a decent hole under very heavy shell fire a shrap. then came very close and to Dixon’s disgust an Officer who happened to come along just then beat him for the hole & left him trying to crowd himself into his tin hat\n","126":"\n\nShelled all night & shelled all the way out this morning.

The other companies are now having their spell but we are hanging on still\n","129":"\n\nThere is a big 12\" naval gun mounted on a Railway truck with other carriages to accommodate the Gun crew also a loco to pull it about near our camp. When the gun is about to be fired the Engine gives a blast the Brakes are set on and Bang – our little humpy fairly rocks every time. I don’t care much for the French people I have seen so far. They are very grasping. Its funny to hear our Aeroplanes signalling to the Guns they do so by means of hooters. I have often seen one hovering over the German lines till one of their guns had fired & then back it comes full rip sometimes with a few puff balls after it having spotted the position of the gun. in a few minutes one of our heavy guns would be feeling for that gun or Battery.\n","130":"\n\nWe started 3 days holiday today. Went into town this morning & viewed the church there is a creek flowing under the church. Went to a Picture show last night near the Bison.

It was about 60 yds from us. I thought a new Battery had opened up & on coming out to have a look I found one of our Seargents dying & a private badly wounded there were also some minor wounds. I believe there has been 23 Casualties in the store in the last 3 days. The Seargent was unlucky when the first Bomb exploded he tried to get away but got caught in the barbed wire fence surrounding the bomb enclosure. I notice that we don’t use the Cauldwell Machine gun on this front only the Lewis.\n\n15-8-16\n\nRed letter day\n today met Bob. his lot go back into the line tomorrow but I believe they will be reserves this time (1st Brigade) \n\n16-8-16\n\nRunning rails & line around Wood.

Seen a new type of Plane today with twin screws & rather larger than the ordinary battle planes. Went to another village about 1 ¼ miles south east of Albert & had a Bottle of very fair Champagne in a very dirty yard. There is a rumor that the Aus. Army Corp. is going to Egypt after the next stunt, hope it is correct. Fritz made counter attacks yesterday & to-day. It was marvellous to see the way our Artillery socked it into him. It was also\n\nrather terrible to watch the effects of his H.E, Shells coming over in salvoes. The gun crew of the 12\" here often have a joke with me they blow the engine hooter but don’t discharge the gun.

He looked like a doll as he went sailing up, of course he was killed instantly nearly every bone being broken. Our Anti gun was shooting at the planes at the time but they absolutely ignored them. There were a number of Bombs\n\ndropped but only 3 near us the one mentioned, a dud, & one in the wood, this latter caused 40 casualties 11 being killed.

One of our own planes kept sailing across our Job the Germans shelling him all the time & some of the shell fragments fell rather close to us. We swore at him freely. Seen a\n\nGas attack by our men today they alternated smoke and Gas the resulting bombardment was also worth looking at. Fritz return bombardment was sufficiently lively to make us quit work. Our planes had a bit of a brush up with the Taubes & forced one of them to land.\n","139":"\n\nOn our way to work we met some of the 10\/17 they had apparently just come up to the front. Among others there were C. Gosher Bluey Fell, Skinner, Hammond. A big attack was launched in the direction of Thiepval & the resulting Bombardment was something to write home about. We had to take to the trenches & while there I picked up a diary containing entries extending over about six weeks. I think the owner was killed because there was an unmistakeable smell about the diary. I intend to write to one of the addresses mentioned in it & send it on if required. To return Fritz kept shelling our job the rest of the day & as he had 4 Balloons up he could see everything that we done\n\nWhen we had only 30 yds to do he simply swept that point with Shrapnel so we had to leave that go. coming back with the truck one time he dropped one shell about 100 yds ahead then another about 50 yds ahead we came on steadily to this spot & then run the truck on like hell just in time because he had been waiting for us & the shell dropped 20 yds behind. He sent another to chase us up the line but we beat him that trip.\n","140":"\n\nFritz had a balloon up yesterday watching us at work. after it went down he shelled Blazes out of us, we took to the Trenches & he nearly blew them in on top of us so we vamoosed.

The German prisoners working in the mill do quite a trade in souvenirs. They have numbers of every trade among them and work like\n\nHell in their Dinner hour. The Engine power at the Mill is not quite up to requirements and slight stoppages are frequent.

There were 30 men Frozen to death in the Trenches during the recent cold snap.\n","246":"\n\nGot leave to Amiens yesterday it is 20 miles away & we only had the day to do it in. We got there O.K. after Boarding 3 separate motors (I have had a bad finger which accounts for the delay since my last entry) It was very cold in Amiens, everything frozen, I believe this is the coldest winter for 20 years. We visited the Cathedral which was sand bagged inside. The streets of the town are very narrow and after dark it was very awkward moving about the\n\nstreets no lights being allowed. In spite of it being Sunday the shops were open but they kept their doors shut on account of the intense cold. It is rather difficult to get a good feed there. at tea time we went through the menu twice & then went out and bought pastry. We had a dinner of about 6 courses & even that did’nt quite fill us. In the afternoon we went to the pictures & seen Charlie Chaplin. The girls here are rather stylish. We were lucky enough to get a motor that took us right home. Hun aeroplanes have been coming over the camp every night with Bombs & Machine guns. In consequence of this the night shift has been knocked off. The reason why the planes are so active is because of the Bright moonlight.\n","247":" 7th- 2-17\n\nWe have had between 20 & 30° of Frost every day for the last fortnight. \n","248":"\n\nFritz’s planes have been very active.

Ate a lot of Eggs & returned to Albert in the afternoon. We visited the picture show there & heard some good vaudeville stuff. Signs of a thaw about now.\n","250":"\n\nGerman Planes came over last night flying very low. The anti aircraft guns were firing at them & the shells burst so low that the fragments were fairly raining on the roof of the Mill. Fritz kept his machine guns going & He managed to blow up a big ammunition Dump a few miles away. In the cold weather they had a great deal of trouble with the logs owing to the sap being frozen & blunting the saw. There is a Bomb School close to our camp.\n","251":"\n\nRain & mud started two day ago Rheumatism also started on me I have had an uncomfortable time since.

Our Aviators are scouting for all they are worth to try and locate their new line.\n","254":"\n\nAbout half of our platoon have been sent back to the Battalion 25 Remain. The extent of the German retreat has been greatly exaggerated. We can hear his heavy shells exploding. He seems to be putting up a bit of a Barrage with Big Guns. He has also left plenty of snipers behind. They are causing some casualties. They get a bad time when caught. A recent order asks men returning from the front line to bring salvage back no matter how little it is. There has been a large number of accidents on No 2 Saw bench. There was two today.\n","255":"\n\nElson went away today sick. The niggers went away yesterday the S.A. Govt. that they were too close to the line.

The farmer is held responsible for them. It is significant that the prisoners say nothing about British prisoners.

A heavy snowfall this evening.\n","272":"\n\nThe snow buried our work & we had a chilly time clearing it. We have had snow or rain ever since. We were told to stand by today & are now in our tents awaiting further orders. There has been a heavy Bombardment going on for the last 24 hours & it hasnt\n\nceased yet. Fritz’s big gun has started shelling the town again. I think that is the reason the job has been stopped it is too close to the line for G.O.C. Hdqrs.\n","273":"\n\nWe made a fresh start today erecting Huts at Grevillers. The","274":" Battalion was there on","275":" I strolled across to Bihucourt.

Machine gunners have been advised to act in future cases.\n\nJust seen a wonderfull sight, a german plane got two of our Balloons this evening, the observers in each case escaped in parachutes. One of the Balloons was only about ½ a mile away. The anti air guns were gunning wildly at the Fritz but he took absolutely no notice. We could see his tracer Bullets distinctly going through the Balloon. They were apparently fired from a machine gun. The second Balloon fell in flames only a ¼ of a mile away. It was the pluckiest thing I ever seen. \n\nThe first train that I seen arrived here today. There is an empty pedestal opposite\n\nThe Town Hall site. I believe the Germans removed the Statue it supported. I seen Jimmy Clarke last Sunday on a disabled ambulance. The Germans have a memorial in the Cemetery very close to a similar French one. Fritz keeps shelling. It has been decided to abandon this site. One of the Boys J. Davis 2nd Batt. got very drunk on Monday & kept us awake listening to an imaginary Bombardment.

He must know we are leaving. One of his shells hit a Railway Engine about 200 yds from\n\nour tent. There was a very heavy explosion due to the shell then a roar of escaping steam. The train was evidently his objective because he landed a few others alongside it. The train then dropped the disabled Engine. Divided into two sections with an Engine on each. one section Steamed away. The remaining engine was overloaded & could only pull its load until it got opposite the Casualty Clearing Station. Fritz still sniping. There are some female nurses at the C.C.S. They must be having a bad time. Fritzs planes must be spotting for this gun because our Anti Guns are going all the time. As also are the Machine Guns. I went over & had a look at the disabled Engine\n\nThe shell hit the fore part of the Engine pierced the Boiler & exploded underneath blowing the per. way up & also blowing three foremost wheels of the engine.

It is fitted with imitation candles with flame shaped electric bulbs. At the main Gate there are two lamps about 4’ x 3’ made like an old fashioned lantern but with electric cluster lamps inside. Part of the building is made of chalk blocks in some cases moulded. The walls seem to be made of bricks & are\n\nvery thick with an inside panelling of Chalk Slabs. looking through the grounds from the Chateau there is no wall visible. Everywhere where there is an avenue in the trees the wall is removed & its place taken by a small moat in some cases supplemented by a wire netting fence.

Fritz artillery & machine guns pasting them all the time at last the push of the rear waves pushed the leading ones into our own curtain fire. A few days later we got some of our own back.

There was a large Cemetery at the terminus. on the way back I got out and had a walk around the Citadel a strong point like Mount Solitary with an artificial gulley with very high walls around it. Very old fashioned. Had dinner with George. Had to wait a long time. Cook came out & asked me if I was a Catholic I never answered George said “I am\" – she then asked us about Egypt & said me good Catholique been in Alexandria & Jerusalem. George got served ¼ of an hour ahead of me because he said he was \n\na Catholic. Rather a good joke. I \nam\n a Catholic & he is C. of E. We had some more trips (Tram) & had tea at the same place. While there the lady running the show gave several addresses of Mademoiselles to the Soldiers & also engaged in an animated discussion with an Australian about Zig Zigs & Nic Nics despite the presence of several Ladies & two young Girls. The Soldiers smashed two Station doors crowding in to get their Train. It was an awfull crush. The M.P. Redcaps were absolutely powerless. On the way home on the train we passed a number of small vegetable Gardens intersected & divided in every direction by small Canals. The Gardeners were travelling in & around their plots in long boats with upturned ends. Not unlike very shabby Gondolas.\n\nSaturday 2-6-17\n\nThe Mill is becoming a tower of Babel.
